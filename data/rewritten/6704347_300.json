This study investigates the safety and anti-epileptic effects of intracerebral muscimol infusion.\n\nMethods: In this phase 1 randomised controlled trial, 3 adult patients with DRE were recruited from a single center. Eligibility criteria included adults with confirmed DRE. Participants underwent convection-enhanced delivery (CED) of artificial CSF vehicle followed by muscimol into the seizure focus for 12 to 24 hours using a crossover design. The primary outcome was seizure frequency, assessed over the infusion period. Secondary outcomes included electroencephalogram (EEG) spike-wave activity and power-spectral EEG frequency. Randomisation was conducted using a computer-generated sequence, and allocation was concealed. Blinding was not implemented.\n\nResults: Three patients were randomised, and all completed the study. Inter-ictal neurological function remained normal. Pathological examination of resected specimens showed no infusion-related brain injuries. Seizure frequency decreased in 1 of 3 patients during muscimol infusion but was unchanged during vehicle infusion. Mean beta frequencies did not differ significantly before, during, or after infusion periods. Infused fluid provided insufficient MRI-signal to track distribution. In the 2 years post-surgery, 1 patient had temporary seizure reduction, and 2 were seizure-free. No adverse events were reported.\n\nInterpretation: CED of muscimol into the epileptic focus did not damage adjacent brain tissue or affect surgical outcomes. The study did not confirm effective seizure suppression. Future studies should use a surrogate tracer for tracking infusion distribution to the epileptic focus and surrounding structures.\n\nTrial registration: [Trial registration number]\n\nFunding: [Source of funding]",
