A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Perioperative Systemic Therapy in Resectable Colorectal Peritoneal Metastases\n\nBackground: To date, no randomised clinical trials have evaluated perioperative systemic therapy compared to cytoreductive surgery and hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (CRS-HIPEC) alone for resectable colorectal peritoneal metastases (CPM).\n\nMethods: This open-label, parallel-group phase 2 randomised clinical trial was conducted in nine Dutch tertiary centers from June 15, 2017, to January 9, 2019. Eligible participants were patients with pathologically confirmed isolated resectable CPM who had not received systemic therapy within six months prior to enrollment. Participants were randomised to receive either perioperative systemic therapy or CRS-HIPEC alone. Perioperative systemic therapy included neoadjuvant and adjuvant cycles of CAPOX, FOLFOX, or FOLFIRI, with bevacizumab added to initial cycles. The primary outcome was the proportion of macroscopic complete CRS-HIPEC and Clavien-Dindo grade 3 or higher postoperative morbidity. Randomisation was performed using a computer-generated sequence, and allocation was concealed. Outcome assessors were blinded.\n\nResults: A total of 79 patients were randomised, with 37 in the experimental arm and 42 in the control arm. The analysis was conducted on a modified intention-to-treat basis. The proportions of macroscopic complete CRS-HIPEC were 89% in the experimental arm and 86% in the control arm (risk ratio, 1.04; 95% CI, 0.88-1.23; P = .74). Clavien-Dindo grade 3 or higher morbidity was 22% in the experimental arm and 33% in the control arm (risk ratio, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.31-1.37; P = .25). No treatment-related deaths occurred. Objective radiologic and major pathologic response rates were 28% and 38%, respectively.\n\nInterpretation: Perioperative systemic therapy is feasible and safe, justifying further investigation in a phase 3 trial.\n\nTrial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02758951\n\nFunding: Not specified.",
