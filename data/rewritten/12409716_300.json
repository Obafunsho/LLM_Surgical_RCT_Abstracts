A 300-word version\n\nTitle: NEON Study: A Randomised Controlled Trial\n\nBackground: Digital nerve injuries frequently occur, yet the benefit of microsurgical suture repair over nerve alignment alone remains unclear. This study aimed to assess the effectiveness of suture repair compared to alignment alone.\n\nMethods: Conducted as a multicentre, double-blind, randomised controlled trial across 17 NHS hospitals in the UK, participants aged 18 and over with unilateral digital nerve injuries were randomised 1:1 to either microsurgical suture repair or nerve alignment alone. The primary outcome was the Impact of Hand Nerve Disorders (I-HaND v2) patient-reported outcome measure at 12 months. Randomisation was computer-generated with allocation concealment, and both participants and assessors were blinded.\n\nResults: From September 2020 to November 2022, 122 participants were randomised, 61 to each group. Primary outcome data were available for 106 participants (87%). No significant differences were observed in I-HaND scores at 12 months (mean difference = 4.3, 95% CI [-0.9, 10.8], p = 0.09). Secondary outcomes, including Patient Evaluation Measure and EQ-5D-5L scores, showed no differences. Complications were similar between groups, with three serious adverse events reported (one in the suture repair group and two in the alignment alone group), all unrelated to treatment. The trial was closed early due to slow recruitment.\n\nInterpretation: The NEON trial provides no evidence supporting the superiority of suture repair over nerve alignment alone for isolated digital nerve injuries. These results can inform future trials, patient discussions, and clinical practice, suggesting that nerve alignment alone may be a viable treatment option.\n\nTrial registration: ISRCTN16211574\n\nFunding: NIHR Health Technology Assessment (NIHR127807–18/37).",
