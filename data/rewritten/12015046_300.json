This study aimed to validate and refine a previously defined hotspot for dorsolateral STN targeting in deep brain stimulation (DBS) for Parkinson’s disease (PD).\n\nMethods: This post hoc analysis of a single-centre randomised controlled trial (RCT) included PD patients undergoing bilateral STN DBS between May 2015 and March 2019. Patients were randomised to DBS under general or local anaesthesia. The primary outcome was hemibody improvement on the Movement Disorder Society–Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale motor examination (MDS-UPDRS ME) at 6 months post-surgery. Randomisation was computer-generated, and allocation was concealed. Blinding was not applicable. A total of 109 patients were randomised, and 106 were analysed using a per-protocol approach.\n\nResults: Poor responders showed a 13% improvement compared to -8% in historical controls (p=0.044). Dopaminergic medication reduction was greater in the current cohort (p=0.020). Variability in hemibody motor improvement was reduced (p=0.003). Motor improvement correlated with the Euclidean distance from active contact to the refined hotspot (2.8 mm lateral, 1.1 mm anterior, 2.2 mm superior to the medial STN border) (p=0.001). No adverse events were reported.\n\nInterpretation: The study validated the hotspot for dorsolateral STN targeting in DBS for PD, showing improved motor response in poor responders, reduced variability in motor improvement, and greater dopaminergic medication reduction. The refined hotspot provides a readily implementable target within the dorsolateral STN on lower field strength MRI.\n\nTrial registration: Not provided.\n\nFunding: Not specified.",
