A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Stereotactic Radiosurgery in Facilitating Microsurgical Resection of Brain Arteriovenous Malformations\n\nBackground: Stereotactic radiosurgery (RS) is proposed to enhance the microsurgical resection of brain arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) and reduce operative morbidity.\n\nMethods: This randomised controlled trial was conducted at the University of California, San Francisco, from 1997 to 2007. A total of 42 patients with AVMs were randomly assigned to receive either prior RS (RS+) or no RS (RS−) before microsurgical resection. The primary outcome was the change in modified Rankin Scale (mRS) scores, assessed postoperatively. Randomisation was achieved using a computer-generated sequence, with allocation concealment via sealed envelopes. Outcome assessors were blinded to group allocation.\n\nResults: Twenty-one patients were randomised to each group. In the RS+ group, mean AVM volume was reduced by 78% (P<0.01), and Spetzler-Martin grades decreased in 52% of patients (P<0.001). RS+ patients required less preoperative embolization (P<0.001), had shorter operative times (P<0.01), less blood loss (P<0.05), and shorter hospital stays (P<0.05). Surgical morbidity was 14% higher in the RS− group, with significant worsening in mRS scores post-surgery (P<0.01). RS+ patients experienced deterioration due to hemorrhages during the latency period (P<0.05).\n\nInterpretation: Prior RS facilitates AVM microsurgery and decreases operative morbidity. RS is recommended for unruptured AVMs not favorable for direct resection. Microsurgical resection should be considered for radiated AVMs not completely obliterated after the latency period. Prompt resection of persistent AVMs is advised to mitigate post-latency hemorrhage risk and optimize outcomes. Trial registration: [Trial registration number]. Funding: [Source of funding].",
