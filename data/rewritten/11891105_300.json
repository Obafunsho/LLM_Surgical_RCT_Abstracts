A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Interventions to Reduce Opioid Use After Orthopaedic Surgery\n\nBackground: Persistent opioid use after orthopaedic surgery poses a public health challenge. This study investigates the effectiveness of various interventions to reduce opioid consumption post-surgery.\n\nMethods: A systematic review of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) was conducted, searching databases from inception to November 2023. Eligible studies included adult patients who underwent orthopaedic surgery, with interventions applied postoperatively. The primary outcome was the mean daily dose of opioid analgesics in morphine milligram equivalents (MME) at 1–3 months post-randomisation. Two reviewers independently screened studies, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool. Certainty of evidence was evaluated using GRADE. Meta-analysis was performed where appropriate.\n\nResults: From 17,471 records, 39 RCTs were included, involving 4054 participants. Multimodal analgesic interventions resulted in a lower mean daily opioid dose compared to placebo/no intervention/usual care or active control in the medium term. No significant differences were observed for other pharmacological or non-pharmacological interventions. The certainty of evidence ranged from low to moderate. Adverse events were reported in 17 studies, with no significant differences between groups. Most studies reported short-term outcomes, with limited data on long-term effects.\n\nInterpretation: Multimodal analgesic interventions may effectively reduce opioid use in the medium term following orthopaedic surgery. However, high heterogeneity and low certainty of evidence limit definitive conclusions. Further research is needed to identify effective strategies and assess long-term outcomes. The study highlights the need for tailored interventions based on surgery type and patient opioid history.\n\nTrial registration: PROSPERO CRD42022357577.\n\nFunding: Not specified.",
