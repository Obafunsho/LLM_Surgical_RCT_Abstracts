A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of High-Flow Nasal Oxygen vs. Laryngeal Mask Ventilation in Hysteroscopic Surgery\n\nBackground: High-flow nasal oxygen (HFNO) is a novel intraoperative respiratory support strategy. This trial assessed whether HFNO is noninferior to laryngeal mask ventilation (LMV) in terms of intraoperative respiratory support success during 30-minute general anesthesia.\n\nMethods: This single-center, randomized, noninferiority trial was conducted in a university hospital in Rome, Italy, from September 2022 to June 2023. Eligible participants were ASA class I and II patients undergoing elective operative hysteroscopy. Participants were randomized 1:1 to receive either HFNO (70 L/min, 100% oxygen) or LMV (volume-controlled ventilation). The primary outcome was intraoperative respiratory support success, defined as SpO2 ≥ 94% and tcCO2 < 65 mm Hg without rescue interventions. Randomization was computer-generated, and allocation was concealed in sealed envelopes. Outcome assessors were blinded.\n\nResults: A total of 180 patients were randomized (90 per group) and analyzed using an intention-to-treat approach. Intraoperative respiratory support was successful in 99% of patients in both groups (absolute difference 0, unilateral 95% CI, 3%, noninferiority P < .001). Postoperative respiratory symptoms were significantly lower in the HFNO group (2% vs. 19%, P < .001). Intraoperative tcCO2 was higher in the HFNO group, with 43% of patients exceeding 55 mm Hg.\n\nInterpretation: HFNO is noninferior to LMV for intraoperative respiratory support during short-duration general anesthesia. The risk of hypercarbia with HFNO necessitates careful patient selection and monitoring. Trial registration: NCT05550584. Funding: Supported by Fisher and Paykel Healthcare.",
