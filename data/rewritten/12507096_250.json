A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Pafolacianine in Intraoperative Molecular Imaging for Lung Cancer\n\nBackground: This study aimed to evaluate the clinical utility of pafolacianine, a folate receptor–targeted fluorescent agent, in detecting folate receptor α positive lung cancers and narrow surgical margins during surgery.\n\nMethods: In this Phase 3, 12-center trial, 112 patients with suspected or biopsy-confirmed lung cancer scheduled for sublobar pulmonary resection were randomly assigned to surgery with or without intraoperative molecular imaging using a 10:1 ratio. The primary outcome was the proportion of participants experiencing a clinically significant event, indicating a meaningful change in the surgical operation. Randomisation was conducted using a computer-generated sequence, and allocation was concealed. Blinding was not applicable.\n\nResults: A total of 102 participants were analysed, with 92 in the intervention group and 10 in the control group, using an intention-to-treat approach. Clinically significant events occurred in 53% of participants, significantly exceeding the prespecified limit of 10% (P < .0001). Intraoperative molecular imaging identified margins ≤10 mm from the primary nodule in 38% of participants, with 32 confirmed by histopathology. It also located the primary nodule in 19% of cases undetectable by conventional methods and revealed 10 occult malignant lesions in 8% of participants. No drug-related serious adverse events were reported.\n\nInterpretation: Intraoperative molecular imaging with pafolacianine enhances surgical outcomes by identifying occult tumors and close margins.
