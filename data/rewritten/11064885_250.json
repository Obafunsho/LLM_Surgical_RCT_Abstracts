A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Supervised Exercise Versus Standard Care Following Lower Limb Revascularisation in Peripheral Arterial Disease\n\nBackground: Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) often leads to intermittent claudication, treated with medical management and exercise therapy. This study evaluates the effects of supervised exercise versus standard care post-lower limb revascularisation.\n\nMethods: We conducted a randomised controlled trial involving 376 participants with PAD, aged 18 and older, who underwent successful lower limb revascularisation. Participants were randomised to receive either supervised exercise or standard care. The primary outcome was maximum walking distance (MWD) on a treadmill, measured over a follow-up period ranging from six weeks to five years. Randomisation was computer-generated, and allocation was concealed. Outcome assessors were blinded.\n\nResults: Of the 376 participants, 189 were randomised to the exercise group and 187 to standard care. Analysis included 89 in the exercise group and 108 in standard care, using an intention-to-treat approach. Exercise showed no significant improvement in MWD from baseline (MD 159.47 m, 95% CI -36.43 to 355.38). However, exercise may improve absolute MWD at follow-up (MD 301.89 m, 95% CI 138.13 to 465.65). No adverse events were reported.\n\nInterpretation: Evidence is very uncertain regarding the benefits of supervised exercise post-revascularisation in PAD. Further large-scale trials are needed.
