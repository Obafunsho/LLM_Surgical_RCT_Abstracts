A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial Comparing Supra-Annular and Intra-Annular Aortic Valve Replacement\n\nBackground: This study aimed to compare the early outcomes of supra-annular versus intra-annular aortic valve replacement (AVR) in patients with isolated AVR.\n\nMethods: This retrospective observational study was conducted at Kartal Kosuyolu High Specialization Training and Research Hospital, involving 113 patients over 18 years who underwent isolated AVR between March 2013 and June 2019. Patients were divided into supra-annular (n=59) and intra-annular (n=54) groups. The primary outcome was the difference in postoperative complications and echocardiographic findings at one month. Randomisation and blinding were not applicable due to the study's retrospective nature.\n\nResults: The supra-annular group had significantly longer cross-clamp (74.44±15.71 min) and cardiopulmonary bypass times (106.98±22.06 min) compared to the intra-annular group (48.31±13.21 min and 76.63±23.41 min, respectively; p<0.001). No significant differences were found between the groups in terms of postoperative complications or echocardiographic findings, including ejection fraction and pressure gradients. Adverse events were similar between groups.\n\nInterpretation: Supra-annular and intra-annular AVR showed no significant differences in early postoperative outcomes. Supra-annular positioning may be considered for patients with small annulus, but further prospective studies are needed. The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Kartal Kosuyolu High Specialization Training and Research Hospital. No trial registration or funding information was provided.",
