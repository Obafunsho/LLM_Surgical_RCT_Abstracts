A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Anterolateral Versus Midline Skin Incision in Total Knee Arthroplasty: A Randomised Controlled Trial\n\nBackground: The anterior midline skin incision in total knee arthroplasty (TKA) often necessitates sectioning the infrapatellar branch of the saphenous nerve, potentially leading to lateral cutaneous hypesthesia and neuroma formation. This study evaluates whether an anterolateral skin incision reduces skin hypesthesia and postoperative discomfort.\n\nMethods: In this randomised controlled trial, 69 knees were assigned to TKA via either a midline or an anterolateral skin incision. Participants were eligible if they required TKA and were recruited from a single orthopedic center. The primary outcome was the area of skin hypesthesia, measured using Semmes-Weinstein monofilament at 13 reference points at 6 weeks, 6 months, and 12 months postoperatively. Randomisation was performed using a computer-generated sequence, and allocation was concealed. Blinding was applied to outcome assessors.\n\nResults: The anterolateral incision group exhibited significantly smaller areas of hypesthesia compared to the midline group at all time points: 32 cm² vs. 76 cm² at 6 weeks, 14 cm² vs. 29 cm² at 6 months, and 7 cm² vs. 19 cm² at 1 year. Clinical scores and knee ROM were similar between groups. A correlation was observed between smaller hypesthesia areas and improved WOMAC and KOOS scores and greater knee flexion.\n\nInterpretation: The anterolateral incision is associated with fewer sensory disturbances and is a viable alternative to the midline incision in TKA. No adverse events were reported. Trial registration: [Trial registration number]. Funding: [Source of funding].",
