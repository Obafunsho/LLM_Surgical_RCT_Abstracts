This study investigates the impact of different immunosuppressive regimens on vaccine efficacy.\n\nMethods: The OPTIMIZE trial, an open-label, randomised controlled trial, enrolled elderly KTRs (≥65 years) at the University Medical Center Groningen. Participants were randomised to either a standard regimen of calcineurin inhibitor (CNI), mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), and prednisolone, or a regimen with low-dose CNI, everolimus, and prednisolone. The primary outcome was seroconversion rate, assessed after 2 and 3 COVID-19 mRNA vaccinations. A total of 32 participants were analysed for humoral response, and 15 for cellular response. Randomisation was open-label, and outcome assessors were not blinded.\n\nResults: In the MMF group, seroconversion rates were 13% after 2 vaccinations and 38% after 3 vaccinations. In contrast, the everolimus group showed significantly higher rates of 56% (p = 0.009) and 100% (p = 0.006), respectively. IgG antibody levels were also significantly elevated in the everolimus group (p = 0.004 and p < 0.001). No significant differences were observed in cellular response between the groups. No adverse events were reported during the study.\n\nInterpretation: The use of an immunosuppressive regimen with everolimus and reduced CNI dose is associated with a significantly improved humoral response to COVID-19 vaccination in elderly KTRs. These findings suggest potential benefits of everolimus-based regimens in enhancing vaccine efficacy in this high-risk population. Further studies in larger and more diverse cohorts are recommended to confirm these results and explore long-term outcomes.\n\nTrial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03797196\n\nFunding: Not specified.",
