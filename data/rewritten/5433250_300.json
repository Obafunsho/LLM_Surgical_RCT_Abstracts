This study evaluates the effectiveness of cryoablation in treating early-stage breast cancer.\n\nMethods: This phase II trial included patients with unifocal invasive ductal breast cancer ≤2 cm, with <25% intraductal component and tumor enhancement on MRI. The primary endpoint was the rate of complete tumor ablation, defined as no remaining invasive breast cancer (IBC) or ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) on pathologic examination. A secondary objective was to evaluate the negative predictive value of MRI. A total of 99 patients were enrolled from 19 centers, with 86 patients (87 breast cancers) evaluable for data analysis. Randomisation and allocation concealment methods were not specified. Blinding was not reported.\n\nResults: Successful ablation was achieved in 66/87 (75.9%) cancers, with a 90% confidence interval of 67.1–83.2. The negative predictive value of MRI was 81.2% (90% CI 71.4–88.8). When multifocal disease outside the targeted zone was not considered a failure, 80/87 (92%) of treated cancers had successful ablation. No adverse events were reported.\n\nInterpretation: Cryoablation shows promise as a non-surgical treatment for early-stage breast cancer, with further studies needed to refine the protocol. The study highlights the potential of cryoablation in achieving complete tumor ablation in a significant proportion of cases. Trial registration: NCT01094353.
