A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial on Lymph Node Retrieval in Locally Advanced Rectal Cancer\n\nBackground: This study investigates the optimal number of lymph nodes (LNs) to retrieve in patients with locally advanced rectal cancer (LARC) after total neoadjuvant therapy (TNT) and its impact on survival.\n\nMethods: A post-hoc analysis of the STELLAR trial, a multicentre, open-label, randomised phase III trial, was conducted. Participants were patients with mid- and distal-LARC from 16 tertiary centres in China, aged 18-70, with specific clinical criteria. They were randomised to receive either short-term radiotherapy followed by chemotherapy (TNT group) or long-term concurrent chemotherapy (CRT group). Randomisation was computer-generated and allocation was concealed via a central trial office. The primary outcome was overall survival (OS), measured from randomisation to death. Disease-free survival (DFS) was a secondary outcome.\n\nResults: From 2015 to 2018, 451 patients were analysed, with 227 in the TNT group. The median LN retrieval was 11. Patients with limited lymphadenectomy (<11 LNs) had worse OS than those with extended lymphadenectomy (HR 2.95, 95% CI 1.47 to 5.92, P = 0.001). Adjuvant chemotherapy improved OS and DFS in the limited lymphadenectomy subgroup (P < 0.001). No significant difference in OS or DFS was observed in the extended lymphadenectomy subgroup with or without adjuvant chemotherapy.\n\nInterpretation: Retrieving at least 11 LNs is recommended for optimal prognostic benefits in LARC patients post-TNT. Adjuvant chemotherapy is beneficial for those with limited lymphadenectomy.\n\nTrial registration: NCT02533271.
