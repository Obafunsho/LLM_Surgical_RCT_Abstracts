Participants were randomized to receive either a control diet or a diet supplemented with polyphenols, omega-3, vitamin E, and selenium. The primary outcome was endogenous carbon monoxide (CO) elimination, measured by gas chromatography over 60 days. Randomization was computer-generated, and allocation was concealed. Blinding was applied to outcome assessors. Participants were hospitalized for 88 days, including 14 days of baseline, 60 days of 6° head-down tilt bed rest, and 14 days of reambulation.\n\nResults: CO elimination increased significantly after 5, 11, 30, and 57 days of bed rest compared to baseline: +289 ppb (95% CI 101–477 ppb; p = 0.004), +253 ppb (78–427 ppb; p = 0.007), +193 ppb (89–298 ppb; p = 0.001), and +858 ppb (670–1046 ppb; p < 0.000), respectively. Bilirubin and iron levels also increased during bed rest. The nutritional intervention did not affect CO elimination. Total hemoglobin mass decreased by 10% after 60 days of bed rest. No adverse events were reported.\n\nInterpretation: Bed rest enhanced hemolysis, contributing to a decrease in total hemoglobin mass. The nutritional intervention had no effect on hemolysis. These findings suggest increased hemolysis as a mechanism for anemia in astronauts.\n\nTrial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT03594799.\n\nFunding: The study was funded by the Center National d’Etudes Spatiales and the European Space Agency.",
