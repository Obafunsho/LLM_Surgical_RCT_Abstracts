A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Peripheral Regional Anaesthesia in Surgery\n\nBackground: Peripheral regional anaesthesia is increasingly used, yet evidence supporting its efficacy and impact on surgical outcomes is often insufficient. This study evaluates the effectiveness and complications of peripheral nerve blocks compared to systemic analgesia in adult surgical patients.\n\nMethods: We conducted a randomised controlled trial involving adult patients undergoing surgery, comparing peripheral nerve blocks to systemic analgesia. Participants were eligible if they were 18 years or older. The primary outcome was block success rate, measured immediately post-surgery. Randomisation was performed using computer-generated sequences, with allocation concealment via sealed envelopes. Blinding was applied to outcome assessors.\n\nResults: A total of 128 studies were included, with 64 participants randomised to each group. Analysis was conducted on 62 participants in the intervention group and 60 in the control group using an intention-to-treat approach. Interscalene blocks for shoulder surgery demonstrated significant pain reduction (mean difference = 2.5, 95% CI 1.5 to 3.5; p < 0.01). Saphenous nerve blocks were preferred for knee surgery due to reduced falls. Cervical plexus, intercostal nerve, and ilioinguinal/iliohypogastric nerve blocks showed efficacy for additional surgical indications. Adverse events were reported in 3% of the intervention group and 1% of the control group.\n\nInterpretation: Peripheral nerve blocks, particularly interscalene and saphenous nerve blocks, are effective for specific surgical indications. However, there remains a need for rigorous, multicentre randomised controlled trials with agreed patient-centred outcomes to further validate these findings. The study highlights the potential for peripheral nerve blocks to improve surgical outcomes, but also underscores the necessity for further research to establish comprehensive evidence.\n\nTrial registration: Not provided.\n\nFunding: Departmental sources.",
