Despite advancements, EC remains deadly, necessitating further research.\n\nMethods: This randomised controlled trial evaluated the efficacy of multimodality therapy in EC management. Participants were recruited from multiple centers, with eligibility criteria including confirmed EC diagnosis. Randomisation was performed using a computer-generated sequence, with allocation concealment ensured through sealed envelopes. Blinding was applied to outcome assessors, patients, and clinicians.\n\nIntervention: Participants were randomised to receive either standard care or an enhanced multimodality therapy, including surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and immunotherapy.\n\nObjective: The study aimed to assess the impact of multimodality therapy on EC outcomes.\n\nOutcome: The primary outcome was overall survival, measured over a 5-year period.\n\nResults: A total of 200 participants were randomised: 100 to the intervention group and 100 to the control group, between January 2020 and June 2021. Analysis was conducted on 98 participants in the intervention group and 97 in the control group using an intention-to-treat approach. The intervention group showed a significant improvement in overall survival (hazard ratio = 0.75, 95% CI 0.60 to 0.95; p = 0.02). Adverse events were reported in 5% of the intervention group and 3% of the control group, with mild severity.\n\nHarm: Adverse events were mild, occurring in 5% of the intervention group and 3% of the control group.\n\nTrial registration: NCTXXXXXXX.\n\nFunding: The trial was funded by [Funding Source].",
