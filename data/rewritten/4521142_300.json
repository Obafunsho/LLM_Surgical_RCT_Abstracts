This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of various image guidance systems compared to standard surgery.\n\nMethods: This preclinical randomised study involved 50 novice surgeons, randomly assigned to one of five groups: (1) no image guidance, (2) triplanar display, (3) always-on solid overlay, (4) always-on wire mesh overlay, and (5) on-demand inverse realism overlay. Participants were tasked with identifying a basilar tip aneurysm in a validated model head. Primary outcomes were time to task completion (seconds) and tool path length (millimeters), measured immediately post-intervention. Secondary outcomes included recognition of an unexpected finding and subjective depth perception. Randomisation was performed using a computer-generated sequence, with allocation concealment ensured. Blinding was not applicable due to the study design.\n\nResults: Image guidance significantly reduced time to task completion and tool path length compared to no guidance (p < 0.001 and p = 0.003, respectively). Augmented reality groups showed reduced tool path distance compared to triplanar display (p = 0.010). Always-on solid overlay led to the highest inattentional blindness (20% recognition of unexpected finding). Wire mesh and on-demand overlays reduced inattentional blindness, comparable to triplanar display (40% recognition). Wire mesh and inverse realism overlays improved subjective depth perception compared to always-on solid overlay (p = 0.031 and p = 0.008). No adverse events were reported.\n\nInterpretation: Augmented reality platforms may improve performance in novice surgeons, though all modalities pose a risk of inattentional blindness.
