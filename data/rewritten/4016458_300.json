The study was conducted at a single orthopedic center. The primary outcome was patient satisfaction, assessed at the time of followup and one year later for the web-based group. Randomisation was performed using a computer-generated sequence, and allocation was concealed. Blinding was not applicable due to the nature of the interventions.\n\nResults: A total of 229 patients completed the study (111 in the usual-care group, 118 in the web-based group). Satisfaction was higher in the usual-care group, with 82.0% reporting being extremely or very satisfied, compared to 75.6% in the web-based group (p < 0.01; OR = 3.95; 95% CI, 1.79–8.76). Additionally, 92.8% of the usual-care group were satisfied with their surgeon's care compared to 73.9% in the web-based group (p < 0.01, OR = 1.37; 95% CI, 0.73–2.57). Preference for followup method was 44% for web-based, 36% for in-person, and 16% had no preference (p = 0.01). No adverse events were reported.\n\nInterpretation: Although in-person followup resulted in higher satisfaction, the web-based method provides significant cost and time-saving advantages. Further studies are needed to optimize patient satisfaction while leveraging these benefits.\n\nTrial registration: [Trial registration number]\n\nFunding: [Source of funding]",
