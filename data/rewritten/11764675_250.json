A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Hemodynamic and Anatomic Changes in Great Saphenous Vein Tributaries After Endovenous Laser Ablation\n\nBackground: This study evaluates the hemodynamic and anatomic changes in great saphenous vein (GSV) tributaries following endovenous laser ablation (EVLA).\n\nMethods: Conducted at the Hospital das Clínicas de Pernambuco/UFPE, this trial included symptomatic adult patients with chronic venous disease classified as C2 to C5. Participants underwent EVLA from April 2022 to June 2023. The primary outcome was the change in GSV tributary diameter and reflux, assessed by Doppler ultrasound preoperatively and 3 months post-treatment. The intervention involved EVLA with a 1470-nm diode laser, while the control was standard care. Randomisation and allocation concealment methods were not specified. Blinding was not implemented.\n\nResults: Of 25 patients, 23 completed the study, with 28 lower limbs analyzed. Ninety days post-EVLA, all treated GSVs were occluded. The average GSV diameter decreased significantly in all regions (P ≤ .001). Among 101 tributaries, a significant reduction in diameter and reflux was observed (P < .001). The Venous Clinical Severity Score decreased from 9 to 5 points (P < .001). No adverse events were reported.\n\nInterpretation: EVLA significantly reduced GSV tributary diameters and reflux, improving clinical outcomes. However, tributary occlusion was infrequent.\n\nTrial registration: Not provided.\n\nFunding: Not applicable.",
