Participants were divided into nonobese (BMI <30 kg/m², n = 854) and obese (BMI ≥30 kg/m², n = 336) groups. The primary outcome measures included Short Form-36 physical function and bodily pain scores, and the Oswestry Disability Index, assessed at baseline and up to four years. Randomisation and allocation concealment methods were not specified. Blinding details were not provided. An as-treated analysis was performed.\n\nResults: At four years, obese patients showed less improvement in primary outcomes compared to nonobese patients in both operative and nonoperative groups. In the operative group, obese patients had lower improvements in Short Form-36 physical function (37.3 vs. 47.7, p < 0.001) and bodily pain (44.2 vs. 50.0, p = 0.005), and Oswestry Disability Index (−33.7 vs. −40.1, p < 0.001). In the nonoperative group, differences were noted in physical function (23.1 vs. 32.0, p < 0.001) and Oswestry Disability Index (−21.4 vs. −26.1, p < 0.001). No significant differences in secondary outcomes were observed. Adverse events were not reported.\n\nInterpretation: Obesity is associated with reduced clinical benefit from both operative and nonoperative treatments for lumbar disc herniation. Surgery provided similar benefits over nonoperative treatment regardless of BMI.\n\nTrial registration: Not provided.\n\nFunding: Not specified.",
