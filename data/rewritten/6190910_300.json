This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of a comprehensive care bundle in reducing SSI rates among patients undergoing colorectal surgery at a cancer centre.\n\nMethods: This pragmatic study involved three phases (baseline, implementation, and sustainability) conducted on patients treated consecutively between 2013 and 2016. The intervention included 13 components related to bowel preparation, antibiotic selection and administration, skin preparation, disinfection and hygiene, maintenance of normothermia during surgery, and use of clean instruments for closure. SSI risk was evaluated using a preoperative calculator, and effectiveness was assessed using interrupted time-series regression.\n\nResults: In a population with a mean BMI of 30 kg/m², diabetes mellitus in 17.5%, and smoking history in 49.3%, SSI rates declined from 11.0% to 4.1% following implementation of the intervention bundle (P = 0.001). The greatest reductions in SSI rates occurred in patients at intermediate or high risk of SSI: from 10.3% to 4.7% (P = 0.006) and from 19% to 2% (P < 0.001), respectively. Wound care modifications were significant in the implementation phase, including the use of an overlying surface vacuum dressing (17.2% from 1.4% baseline) or leaving wounds partially open (13.2% from 6.7% baseline). The median length of hospital stay decreased from 7 (i.q.r. 5–10) to 6 (5–9) days (P = 0.002). The greatest reduction in hospital stay was seen in patients at high risk of SSI: from 8 to 6 days (P < 0.001). SSI rates remained low (4.5%) in the sustainability phase.\n\nInterpretation: Meaningful reductions in SSI can be achieved by implementing a multidisciplinary care bundle at a hospital-wide level.",
