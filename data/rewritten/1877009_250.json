The study assessed hospital surgical volume's effect on overall survival and gastric cancer recurrence using Medicare claims data. The primary outcome was overall survival, measured over a median follow-up of 8.9 years. Randomisation and allocation concealment methods were not specified. Blinding details were not provided.\n\nResults: Hospital surgical volume did not predict overall survival (P = 0.46) or disease-free survival (P = 0.43). Patients undergoing D1 or D2 dissection at high- or moderate-volume centers had an adjusted hazard ratio of 0.80 (95% CI, 0.53–1.20) for overall survival and 0.78 (95% CI, 0.53–1.14) for disease-free survival compared to low-volume hospitals, though not statistically significant. No survival impact was observed for D0 resections. Adverse events were not reported.\n\nInterpretation: Hospital procedure volume had no overall effect on long-term gastric cancer survival, excluding perioperative mortality. The potential benefit of moderate- to high-volume centers for D1 or D2 dissection requires further study. Trial registration and funding details were not provided.",
