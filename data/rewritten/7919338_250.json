A 250-word version\n\nBACKGROUND: Cancer stem-like cells contribute to therapy resistance in glioblastoma (GBM) through the Notch signaling pathway, which relies on gamma secretase activity. RO4929097, an oral gamma secretase inhibitor, was evaluated for its efficacy in inhibiting tumor growth. \n\nMETHODS: This phase II and pharmacodynamic study was conducted at [study setting]. Patients with recurrent GBM were randomized into two groups: Group A with unresectable disease received RO4929097 in a standard phase II design, while Group B with resectable disease received the drug before and after surgical resection. The primary outcome was the 6-month progression-free survival rate (PFS 6), and secondary outcomes included the inhibition of neurosphere formation in resected tumor samples. Randomization was performed using [randomization method], with allocation concealment by [method]. Blinding was not implemented. \n\nRESULTS: A total of 47 patients were randomized, with 40 in Group A and 7 in Group B. The PFS 6 was 4% (95% CI [confidence interval]), and neurosphere formation was inhibited in 1 of 7 patient samples. Adverse events were reported in [number] patients, with [frequency and severity]. \n\nINTERPRETATION: RO4929097 showed minimal activity in recurrent GBM patients, with limited inhibition of neurosphere formation. The trial was registered under [trial registration number] and funded by [source of funding].",
