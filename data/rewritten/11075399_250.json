Eligibility criteria included histologically proven colorectal adenocarcinoma with inoperable hepatic metastases and critical limb ischemia with no option but amputation. The primary outcome for chemotherapy was partial response or stable disease over 11.2 months. For peripheral vascular disease, the primary outcome was avoidance of major amputation over 22 months. The trial was registered (ACTRN12611001273976) and approved by the institution’s Human Ethics Committee.\n\nResults: In the chemotherapy group, six out of ten patients achieved partial response or stable disease. In the peripheral vascular disease group, 40% avoided amputation, and 20% had a delay of 4 months. Adverse events included a 4% infection rate and one minor thromboembolic event.\n\nInterpretation: The access system allows repeatable multi-catheter arterial access for chemotherapy, addressing issues of concentration and microvascular control. It supports extracorporeal arterial-to-arterial access, generating flows greater than 1 L/min. The device logistics compare favorably with arteriovenous and venovenous access systems.",
