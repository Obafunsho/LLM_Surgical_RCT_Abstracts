A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial on the Effect of Reverse Bevel Nasotracheal Intubation on Epistaxis\n\nBackground: Nasotracheal intubation via the left nostril is more frequently associated with epistaxis than the right nostril. This study evaluated the effect of a 180˚ reverse bevel and tip direction of the nasotracheal tube on the incidence of epistaxis during left nostril intubation.\n\nMethods: This randomised controlled trial was conducted at Asan Medical Center, Seoul, Korea, from November 2021 to September 2023. Seventy-four patients undergoing right-sided maxillofacial surgery requiring left nasotracheal intubation were randomly allocated to either the control group (conventional tube direction) or the reverse group (180˚ reverse bevel direction). The primary outcome was the incidence of epistaxis, assessed via videolaryngoscopy. Randomisation was performed using web-based software, with allocation concealment ensured. Outcome assessors were blinded. The sample size was calculated to detect a 70% reduction in epistaxis incidence, requiring 33 patients per group.\n\nResults: The incidence of epistaxis was significantly lower in the reverse group (9/37 [24.3%]) compared to the control group (20/37 [54.1%], P = 0.009; relative risk: 0.45, 95% CI [0.24, 0.85], absolute risk reduction: 29.8%, number needed to treat: 3). The severity of epistaxis was also significantly reduced in the reverse group (P = 0.002). First attempt nasal passage success was higher in the reverse group (P = 0.027). No nasotracheal tube-related complications were reported in either group.\n\nInterpretation: The 180˚ reverse bevel and tip direction significantly reduced the incidence and severity of epistaxis and improved patient satisfaction in left nasotracheal intubation.
