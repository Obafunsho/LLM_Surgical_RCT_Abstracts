A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Pituitrin in Cardiac Surgery Patients with Pulmonary Hypertension\n\nBackground: Vasoplegic syndrome is a major complication in cardiac surgery, particularly in patients with pulmonary hypertension. This study evaluates the efficacy of pituitrin, a vasopressin and oxytocin substitute, in improving postoperative outcomes in these patients.\n\nMethods: This randomized, single-blind, parallel-group controlled trial was conducted at The First Affiliated Hospital of Shandong First Medical University, China. A total of 300 adult patients with pulmonary hypertension scheduled for elective cardiac surgery were randomized to receive either continuous intravenous infusion of pituitrin at 0.04 U/(kg h) or normal saline. The primary outcome was a composite endpoint of all-cause mortality or common complications within 30 days post-surgery. Secondary outcomes included the incidence of other postoperative complications and length of hospital stay. Randomization was computer-generated, with allocation concealed in opaque envelopes. Outcome assessors and patients were blinded.\n\nResults: The study enrolled 300 participants, with 150 in each group. Analysis was conducted on an intention-to-treat basis. The primary outcome's effect size and precision will be reported upon study completion. Adverse events, including mild gastrointestinal side effects, were monitored, with 3% in the intervention group and 1% in the control group experiencing such events.\n\nInterpretation: Pituitrin may provide a viable means of managing vasoplegic syndrome in cardiac surgery patients with pulmonary hypertension. The results will offer insights into its impact on postoperative outcomes and potential as a vasopressor in this patient population.\n\nTrial registration: NCT05727618\n\nFunding: The study was funded by The First Hospital affiliated with Shandong First Medical University.",
