A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Noninvasive Focused Ultrasound for Chronic Pain\n\nBackground: Chronic pain significantly impacts quality of life, and current treatments like cingulotomy and deep brain stimulation are invasive. This study investigates a noninvasive focused ultrasound method targeting the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) for pain relief.\n\nMethods: Conducted at the University of Utah, this double-blind, randomised, sham-controlled crossover trial included participants aged 18-65 with chronic pain. Participants were randomised to receive either active or sham ultrasound stimulation. The primary outcome was pain intensity reduction, assessed using the Brief Pain Inventory over 7 days. Randomisation was computer-generated, and allocation was concealed. Blinding was maintained for participants and outcome assessors.\n\nResults: Twenty-three participants were randomised, with 20 completing the study. Active stimulation led to a 60% reduction in pain immediately post-intervention, 43% on day 1, and 33% on day 7. Sham stimulation resulted in reductions of 14.4%, 12.3%, and 6.6%, respectively. The effect size was significant (p < 0.05). No serious adverse events were reported; mild side effects resolved within 24 hours.\n\nInterpretation: The study demonstrates that noninvasive focused ultrasound targeting the ACC can provide rapid and durable pain relief, presenting a viable alternative to invasive surgical options. This approach could potentially reduce reliance on medications with systemic side effects.\n\nTrial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT05674903\n\nFunding: Supported by the University of Utah.",
