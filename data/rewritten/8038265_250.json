Patients scheduled for elective colonic resection were randomised to either MOABP or NBP. The primary outcome was the rate of SSI within 30 days post-surgery. Randomisation was computer-generated, and allocation was concealed. Blinding was applied to recruiters, treating physicians, surgeons, data collectors, and analysts.\n\nResults: A total of 381 patients were randomised: 217 to right colectomy (106 MOABP, 111 NBP) and 164 to left colectomy (84 MOABP, 80 NBP). In right colectomy, SSI rates were 7% (MOABP) and 9% (NBP) (OR 0.71, 95% CI 0.26 to 1.95; P = 0.510). In left colectomy, SSI rates were 6% (MOABP) and 10% (NBP) (OR 0.57, 95% CI 0.18 to 1.82; P = 0.338). No significant differences in overall morbidity or adverse events were observed.\n\nInterpretation: MOABP did not significantly reduce SSI rates or complications compared to NBP in either right or left colectomy. Further research is needed to confirm these findings.\n\nTrial registration: NCT02652637\n\nFunding: Vatsatautien Tutkimussäätiö Foundation, Mary and Georg Ehrnrooth’s Foundation, Finnish Cancer Foundation, Helsinki University Research Funds.",
