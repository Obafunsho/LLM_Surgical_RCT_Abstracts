A 300-word version\n\nTitle: A Cluster Randomised Controlled Trial of the Modified Hospital Elder Life Program in Reducing Delirium and Length of Stay in Older Patients Undergoing Abdominal Surgery\n\nBackground: Delirium is a prevalent and preventable issue in older patients undergoing abdominal surgery, often resulting in prolonged hospital length of stay (LOS).\n\nMethods: This cluster randomised controlled trial was conducted at a 2000-bed urban medical center in Taipei, Taiwan, from August 1, 2009, to October 31, 2012. Participants were older patients (≥65 years) scheduled for elective gastrectomy, pancreaticoduodenectomy, or colectomy with an expected LOS longer than 6 days. A total of 377 patients were cluster randomised by room to receive either the modified Hospital Elder Life Program (mHELP) or usual care. The intervention, administered by an mHELP nurse, included daily protocols of orienting communication, oral and nutritional assistance, and early mobilization. The primary outcome was the presence of delirium, assessed daily using the Confusion Assessment Method by nurses blinded to group allocation. LOS was also recorded.\n\nResults: Of 577 eligible patients, 377 were randomised (197 to mHELP, 180 to control). Delirium occurred in 6.6% of mHELP participants compared to 15.1% of controls, with a relative risk of 0.44 (95% CI, 0.23–0.83; P = .008). The median LOS was 12.0 days for mHELP participants and 14.0 days for controls (P = .04). No adverse events were reported. The analysis was conducted on an intention-to-treat basis.\n\nInterpretation: The mHELP significantly reduced the odds of delirium by 56% and decreased LOS by 2 days in older patients undergoing major abdominal surgery. These findings support the implementation of mHELP in postoperative care for this population. Trial registration: NCT01045330. Funding: Not specified.",
