A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial on Pain Management in Minimally Invasive Cardiac Surgery\n\nBackground: Minimally invasive cardiac surgery (MICS) offers advantages over conventional sternotomy, including reduced tissue trauma and faster recovery. However, effective postoperative pain management remains a challenge.\n\nMethods: This randomised controlled trial was conducted to evaluate pain management strategies in MICS. Participants were eligible if they were undergoing MICS and were recruited from a single cardiac surgery center. The intervention group received thoracic epidural analgesia (TEA), while the control group received thoracic paravertebral block (TPVB). The primary outcome was postoperative pain measured on a visual analog scale (VAS) over 48 hours. Randomisation was computer-generated, and allocation was concealed using sealed envelopes. Blinding was applied to outcome assessors.\n\nResults: A total of 200 participants were randomised: 100 to the TEA group and 100 to the TPVB group. Analysis was conducted on 98 participants in the TEA group and 97 in the TPVB group using an intention-to-treat approach. The mean VAS score was significantly lower in the TEA group (mean difference = 1.5, 95% CI 0.8 to 2.2; p < 0.001). Adverse events were reported in 5% of the TEA group and 3% of the TPVB group, with no severe complications.\n\nInterpretation: TEA provides superior pain relief compared to TPVB in MICS, with a manageable safety profile. Further studies are needed to confirm these findings.\n\nTrial registration: NCT12345678\n\nFunding: This trial was funded by the National Institute of Health.",
