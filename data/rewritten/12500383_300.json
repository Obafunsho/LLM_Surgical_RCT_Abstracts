A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Evaluation of Carotid Artery Stenting Without Embolic Protection Devices in Yemen: A Retrospective Cohort Study\n\nBackground: Carotid artery stenting (CAS) is a minimally invasive alternative to carotid endarterectomy for treating carotid atherosclerotic disease. This study assesses the outcomes of CAS without embolic protection devices (EPDs) in Yemen, a resource-limited country.\n\nMethods: Conducted at Borg Al-Atiba and American Modern Hospital in Aden, Yemen, from March 2023 to March 2025, this retrospective cohort study included 62 patients with symptomatic carotid artery stenosis, confirmed by duplex ultrasound or CTA and DSA. All procedures were performed by a single interventional neurologist using closed-cell Carotid WALLSTENTs. The primary outcome was the occurrence of 30-day periprocedural complications, including mortality, stroke, myocardial infarction, or arrhythmia.\n\nResults: The study included 62 patients (53 males, mean age 60.2 ± 9.7 years). The technical success rate was 100%, with no perioperative cerebral infarctions. One patient developed transient dysarthria, and two experienced significant bradycardia, which responded to atropine. Three patients had mild local hematoma, and one had a femoral pseudoaneurysm. No strokes, myocardial infarctions, or in-stent thrombosis were observed during the 30-day follow-up.\n\nInterpretation: CAS without EPDs in a resource-limited setting demonstrated a low complication rate and high technical success. This suggests that CAS can be a viable option for stroke prevention in countries with limited resources, provided that procedures are conducted by trained professionals. The study highlights the potential of CAS as an effective treatment for carotid artery stenosis in Yemen, emphasizing the need for further research and investment to improve access and outcomes in similar settings.",
