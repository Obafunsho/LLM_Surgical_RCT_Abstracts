A 250-word version\n\nTitle: A Randomised Controlled Trial Comparing Chest Bioreactance and Calibrated Pulse Contour Analysis in Thoracic Cancer Surgery\n\nBackground: Cardiac output monitoring in thoracic cancer surgery is challenging. This study aimed to compare chest bioreactance with calibrated pulse contour analysis (PCA) for cardiac output measurement.\n\nMethods: This prospective monocentre observational study was conducted at a tertiary university hospital. Fifty adult patients undergoing thoracic cancer surgery were included. Simultaneous measurements of cardiac index (CI) using bioreactance (CI-NICOM) and PCA calibrated by transthoracic echocardiography (CI-PCA) were performed at eight intra-operative time points. The primary outcome was the interchangeability of CI-NICOM and CI-PCA, assessed by Bland–Altman analysis and percentage error calculation. Linear regression was used to assess relationships between absolute values and changes in CI.\n\nResults: A significant difference was found between CI-PCA and CI-NICOM: 2.4 ± 0.8 vs. 2.9 ± 0.9 l min −1 m −2, respectively (P < 0.001). CI-NICOM systematically overestimated CI by 21% with large limits of agreement (-2.49 to 1.47 l min −1 m −2). The percentage error was 77%, and concordance rates were 75% and 70% with and without an exclusion zone of 0.5 l min −1 m −2.\n\nInterpretation: Chest bioreactance is feasible and well tolerated in thoracic cancer surgery patients. However, it is not interchangeable with calibrated PCA, showing moderate correlation and trending ability. No adverse events were reported. Trial registration: NCT04251637. Funding: Not specified.",
