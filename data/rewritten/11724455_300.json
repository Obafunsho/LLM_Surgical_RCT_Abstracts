A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Preoperative Smoking Cessation Interventions\n\nBackground: Smoking is a major cause of preventable death and increases the risk of postoperative complications. This study assesses the impact of preoperative smoking cessation interventions on smoking abstinence and postoperative outcomes.\n\nMethods: This systematic review included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and non-RCTs. Eligible participants were smokers aged over 18 scheduled for elective surgery. The intervention group received preoperative smoking cessation support, while the control group received usual care. The primary outcome was smoking cessation at surgery time and at the last follow-up. Randomisation and allocation concealment methods were not specified. Blinding details were not provided.\n\nResults: Sixteen studies (3505 participants) were included, with 14 RCTs (2940 participants) in the meta-analysis. The intervention group showed significantly increased odds of quitting smoking at surgery time (RR 1.64, 95% CI 1.30–2.07) and at the longest follow-up (RR 1.38, 95% CI 1.12–1.70). No significant difference in postoperative complications was observed (RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.62–1.06). Adverse events were not reported. The analysis was conducted using an intention-to-treat approach.\n\nInterpretation: Preoperative smoking cessation interventions significantly increase quit rates at surgery time and at follow-up, with no difference in postoperative complications. The use of standardised outcome measurements is recommended to reduce heterogeneity in future studies. Further investigation focusing on patient perspectives is needed to address low enrolment and high dropout rates.\n\nTrial registration: PROSPERO CRD42023423202.\n\nFunding: Not specified.",
