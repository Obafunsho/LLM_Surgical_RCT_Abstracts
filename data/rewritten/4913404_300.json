A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Sumatriptan for Postoperative Recovery After Microvascular Decompression\n\nBackground: Postoperative headaches following microvascular decompression (MVD) surgery resemble migraines and can hinder recovery. This study assessed the impact of sumatriptan on postoperative recovery quality.\n\nMethods: Conducted as a single-centre, double-blind, randomised controlled trial, 50 patients with postoperative headaches after MVD were enrolled. Eligibility criteria included adult patients undergoing MVD who reported postoperative headaches. Participants were randomised to receive a subcutaneous injection of sumatriptan (6 mg) or saline. The primary outcome was the Quality of Recovery-40 (QoR-40) score at 24 hours post-surgery. Randomisation was computer-generated, and allocation was concealed using sealed envelopes. Blinding included patients, clinicians, and outcome assessors.\n\nResults: Fifty patients were randomised: 25 to the sumatriptan group and 25 to the placebo group, with recruitment occurring over a specified period. The sumatriptan group demonstrated significantly higher QoR-40 scores (median 184; interquartile range 169–196) compared to the placebo group (133; 119–155; P <0.01). Headache scores were significantly lower in the sumatriptan group at 4, 12, and 24 hours. No significant differences were found in other secondary outcomes. Adverse events were mild, with 3/25 (12%) in the sumatriptan group and 1/25 (4%) in the placebo group experiencing mild gastrointestinal side effects. Analysis was conducted on an intention-to-treat basis.\n\nInterpretation: Sumatriptan significantly enhanced the quality of postoperative recovery and reduced headache severity following MVD surgery. The underlying mechanism may involve serotonin-mediated headache reduction and mood modulation. These findings suggest sumatriptan as a viable alternative for managing postcraniotomy headaches.
