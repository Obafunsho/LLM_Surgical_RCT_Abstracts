This study aimed to identify risk factors for epistaxis following NTI and develop a nomogram-based prediction model.\n\nMethods: This single-center, retrospective cohort study was conducted at Shanghai Ninth People's Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, from June 2020 to December 2021. A total of 640 adult patients were initially considered, with 574 meeting eligibility criteria. The primary outcome was the occurrence of epistaxis immediately after NTI, assessed using a video laryngoscope. LASSO regression and multivariate logistic regression were used to identify predictors. The model's performance was evaluated using ROC curves, the Hosmer–Lemeshow test, and decision curve analysis. Randomisation and allocation concealment methods were not applicable due to the study's retrospective nature.\n\nResults: Five predictors were identified: age, history of radiotherapy/chemotherapy, nasal intubation duration, maximum nasal septum deviation on the coronal plane, and location of this deviation on the cross-section. The model's AUC was 0.957 in the training set and 0.900 in the validation set, indicating good discrimination and accuracy. Calibration curves showed good fit, and decision curve analysis demonstrated clinical utility. No adverse events were reported.\n\nInterpretation: The nomogram effectively predicts epistaxis risk following NTI, providing a practical tool for clinicians. This model may enhance surgical safety by guiding preoperative risk stratification and personalized management strategies. The trial is registered with the Chinese Clinical Trial Center (No. ChiCTR2500097696). Funding details were not provided. The study's retrospective design limits the applicability of randomisation and blinding.",
