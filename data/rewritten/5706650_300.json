This study aimed to estimate atrial conduction using AVCP and evaluate its role in optimizing paced atrioventricular delay (pAVD) during biventricular pacing (BiVP).\n\nMethods: Conducted as a single-center, randomized controlled trial at a university-affiliated tertiary care hospital, the study included cardiac surgical patients at risk of left ventricular failure post-cardiopulmonary bypass. Temporary BiVP was optimized immediately after bypass, maintaining constant vasoactive medication and fluid infusion rates. Randomization and allocation concealment methods were not detailed. Blinding of outcome assessors, patients, and clinicians was not specified.\n\nParticipants: Seven patients were randomized, with three assigned to the short-AVCP group (<64 ms) and four to the long-AVCP group (>64 ms).\n\nIntervention: The intervention involved temporary BiVP optimization, with no specific control group.\n\nOutcome: Primary outcomes were optimum cardiac output (OptCO) and mean arterial pressure (OptMAP), assessed immediately post-bypass.\n\nResults: In the short-AVCP group, AVCP, OptCO, and OptMAP were 40 ± 11, 120 ± 0, and 150 ± 30 ms, respectively. In the long-AVCP group, these parameters were 89 ± 10, 218 ± 44, and 218 ± 29 ms. OptCO and OptMAP were significantly lower in the short-AVCP group (p = 0.015 and p = 0.029).\n\nInterpretation: AVCP exhibits significant variability post-bypass, affecting pAVD. Failure to adjust for AVCP may lead to selecting inappropriately short pAVDs, potentially diminishing BiVP effectiveness.\n\nTrial registration: Not provided.\n\nFunding: Not specified.",
