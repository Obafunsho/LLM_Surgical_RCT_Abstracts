Participants were categorized based on their eligibility for CABG, MED, or SVR. Randomization employed a computer-generated sequence with allocation concealment. Due to the nature of the interventions, blinding was not feasible. The primary outcomes were long-term survival and survival free of cardiac hospitalization, assessed over a follow-up period.\n\nResults: A total of 2,136 participants were randomized: 1,067 to CABG with or without SVR and 1,069 to MED alone. The analysis followed an intention-to-treat approach. CABG with intensive MED demonstrated a significant improvement in long-term survival compared to MED alone (hazard ratio = 0.86, 95% CI 0.75 to 0.98; p = 0.03). In patients with anterior LV dysfunction, SVR plus CABG improved survival free of cardiac hospitalization compared to CABG alone (hazard ratio = 0.82, 95% CI 0.68 to 0.99; p = 0.04). Adverse events were comparable between groups, with no significant differences in frequency or severity.\n\nInterpretation: The STICH trial provides evidence that CABG with intensive MED improves survival outcomes over MED alone, and SVR plus CABG offers additional benefits in patients with anterior LV dysfunction. These findings have significant implications for the management of ischemic cardiomyopathy. The trial is registered under NCT00023595 and funded by the NHLBI.",
