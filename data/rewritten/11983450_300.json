A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Imaging Modalities for Lobular Carcinoma Detection\n\nBackground: Lobular carcinoma (LC) is challenging to diagnose due to its subtle imaging characteristics, often resulting in delayed diagnosis. This study assesses the effectiveness of traditional versus advanced imaging modalities in detecting LC.\n\nMethods: Conducted at a tertiary care center, this randomised controlled trial included women aged 40-70 with suspected LC. Participants were randomised into two groups: traditional imaging (mammography and ultrasound) and advanced imaging (MRI, DBT, CEM, BSGI). The primary outcome was diagnostic accuracy, evaluated over a six-month period. Randomisation was computer-generated, and allocation concealment was achieved using sealed envelopes. Outcome assessors were blinded to group allocation, while patients and clinicians were not.\n\nResults: A total of 200 participants were randomised: 100 to the traditional imaging group and 100 to the advanced imaging group, between January 2020 and June 2021. In the intention-to-treat analysis, 98 participants in the traditional group and 97 in the advanced group were analysed. Advanced imaging demonstrated significantly higher diagnostic accuracy (mean difference = 15%, 95% CI 10% to 20%; p < 0.001). Adverse events were minimal, with 3% in the advanced group and 1% in the traditional group experiencing mild discomfort.\n\nInterpretation: Advanced imaging modalities, including MRI, DBT, CEM, and BSGI, significantly enhance diagnostic accuracy for LC compared to traditional methods. These findings suggest that incorporating advanced imaging into clinical workflows could improve early detection and management of LC, ultimately leading to better patient outcomes.\n\nTrial registration: NCT01234567\n\nFunding: This trial was funded by the National Cancer Institute.",
