A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Effect of Prophylactic Antibiotics on Intraoperative Cultures in Revision Arthroplasty: A Randomised Controlled Trial\n\nBackground: Preoperative antibiotics are crucial for reducing periprosthetic joint infection (PJI) risk in primary total hip and knee arthroplasty (THA and TKA). However, their use in revision surgery is debated due to potential interference with intraoperative cultures.\n\nMethods: This multicenter, prospective randomised controlled trial included 65 patients with confirmed PJI after 37 TKAs and 28 THAs. Eligibility required a culture-positive aspiration and no antibiotics within two weeks prior. Participants were randomised to receive prophylactic antibiotics either before skin incision or after obtaining a minimum of three sets of intraoperative cultures. Randomisation was performed using a computer-generated sequence, and allocation was concealed. The primary outcome was the concordance of intraoperative and preoperative cultures, assessed immediately post-surgery.\n\nResults: Of the 65 randomised, 34 received antibiotics before incision, and 31 after culture collection. Intraoperative cultures matched preoperative cultures in 28/34 (82%) of the pre-incision group and 25/31 (81%) of the post-culture group, showing statistical equivalence (p = 0.0290). No adverse events were reported in either group.\n\nInterpretation: Administering prophylactic antibiotics before skin incision does not affect intraoperative culture results in revision arthroplasty. Given their benefits in preventing PJI, withholding antibiotics for fear of culture interference is unwarranted.\n\nTrial registration: [Trial registration number]\n\nFunding: [Source of funding]",
