All participants received an initial ropivacaine bolus. The primary outcome was average pain on postoperative day (POD) 1, measured on a 0–10 scale. Secondary outcomes included least and worst pain scores, oral opioid requirements, sleep disturbances, patient satisfaction, and incidence of complications. Randomisation was computer-generated, and allocation was concealed. Blinding included patients, clinicians, and outcome assessors.\n\nResults: Of the 32 randomised, 30 were analysed per protocol (15 in each group). Continuous ropivacaine infusion significantly reduced average pain on POD 1 (median [10th–90th percentile]: 0.0 [0.0–5.0] vs. 3.0 [0.0–6.0]; P < 0.001). Median oral opioid consumption was lower in the ropivacaine group on POD 1 and 2 (P = 0.002). Sleep disturbances were fewer (P = 0.005), and patient satisfaction was higher (P < 0.001) in the ropivacaine group. No significant adverse events were reported.\n\nInterpretation: Continuous posterior interscalene block provides superior analgesia, reduces opioid use, and improves sleep and satisfaction compared to a single-injection block.
