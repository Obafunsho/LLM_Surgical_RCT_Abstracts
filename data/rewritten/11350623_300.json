This study assesses the effectiveness of non-surgical interventions in preventing CLL tissue loss and amputation.\n\nMethods: A randomised controlled trial was conducted involving 50 dysvascular amputees. Participants were randomised to receive either electrostimulation of the gastrocnemius muscle plus standard rehabilitation or standard rehabilitation alone. The primary outcome was the incidence of new major amputation of the CLL over a 12-month period. Randomisation was based on birthdate, with unclear allocation concealment. Blinding of outcome assessors, patients, and clinicians was not reported.\n\nResults: Electrostimulation was associated with a three-fold reduction in the incidence of new major amputation of the CLL (RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.04 to 2.99). No new incidence of tissue loss was reported. There was no difference in 12-month survival between the groups (RR 1.0, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.18). Adverse events, time to new tissue loss, time to and incidence of minor amputation, health-related quality of life outcomes, and hospital readmissions were not reported. The overall certainty of the evidence was judged to be very low, with a high risk of performance bias and unclear risk of selection and detection bias.\n\nInterpretation: While electrostimulation may reduce the risk of major amputation in dysvascular amputees, the evidence is limited by a high risk of bias. Further high-quality research is necessary to confirm these findings and inform clinical practice.\n\nTrial registration: Protocol available via DOI 10.1002/14651858.CD013857\n\nFunding: This study received no dedicated funding.",
