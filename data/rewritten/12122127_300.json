Adult kidney transplant recipients were eligible for inclusion. Participants were randomised to either C0-based monitoring or AUC-based monitoring. Randomisation was computer-generated, and allocation was concealed using sealed envelopes. Due to the nature of the intervention, blinding was not applied.\n\nIntervention: The intervention group received AUC-based monitoring, while the control group continued with standard C0-based monitoring.\n\nObjective: To evaluate the efficacy of AUC-based monitoring compared to C0-based monitoring in preventing tacrolimus-related toxicity and improving graft survival.\n\nOutcome: The primary outcome was the incidence of biopsy-proven acute rejection (BPAR) within 12 months post-transplant.\n\nResults: A total of 200 participants were randomised: 100 to the intervention and 100 to the control group, between January 2020 and June 2021. Analysis was conducted on 98 participants in the intervention group and 97 in the control group using an intention-to-treat approach. The intervention group showed a significant reduction in BPAR (mean difference = 5.2%, 95% CI 3.1 to 7.3; p = 0.01). Adverse events were reported in 3% of the intervention group and 1% of the control group, with mild gastrointestinal side-effects being the most common.\n\nTrial registration: N/A\n\nFunding: The trial was funded by institutional grants, with no involvement from commercial entities.",
