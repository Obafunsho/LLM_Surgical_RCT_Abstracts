This study aims to compare clinical outcomes of patients undergoing left-sided valve procedures with or without CTR.\n\nMethods: A systematic literature search was conducted using MEDLINE, EMBASE, Scopus, and Web of Science. Eligibility criteria included studies comparing outcomes of mitral/aortic valve surgery with or without CTR for functional TR. The primary outcome was cardiac mortality, and secondary outcomes included overall mortality, stroke, wound infection, reoperation, atrial fibrillation, renal failure, intensive care stay, and permanent pacemaker implantation. A random effects model was used for analysis.\n\nResults: Thirty-six studies with 76,249 patients were included. CTR significantly reduced cardiac mortality (p < 0.0001) despite longer CPB (p < 0.00001) and X-Clamp times (p < 0.00001). No significant difference was found in overall mortality. Postoperative TR was significantly lower with CTR (p < 0.00001). No differences were observed in stroke, wound infection, atrial fibrillation, renal failure, or intensive care stay.\n\nInterpretation: CTR for moderate TR during left-sided valve surgery improves survival by reducing cardiac mortality and late TR without increasing morbidity.
