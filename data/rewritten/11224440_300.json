A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Radiotherapy and Immune Checkpoint Inhibitor in Metastatic Esophageal Cancer\n\nBackground: Radiotherapy (RT) and immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) are essential treatments for esophageal cancer. This study evaluates the safety and efficacy of combining RT with ICI in patients with metastatic esophageal cancer.\n\nMethods: This randomised controlled trial was conducted at Chongqing Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine. Eligible participants were patients with metastatic esophageal cancer. Participants were randomly assigned to receive either RT combined with ICI or standard care. The primary outcome was the incidence of severe thrombocytopenia, measured over a 6-month period. Randomisation was performed using a computer-generated sequence, and allocation was concealed using sealed envelopes. Blinding was not applied.\n\nResults: A total of 200 participants were randomised: 100 to the intervention group and 100 to the control group, between January 2020 and June 2021. In the intervention group, 98 participants were analysed using an intention-to-treat approach. The intervention group experienced a higher incidence of severe thrombocytopenia compared to the control group. Next-generation sequencing revealed increased JAK2 gene copies in surgical specimens, suggesting a potential mechanism for thrombocytopenia and tumor progression. Adverse events were more frequent in the intervention group, with 3% experiencing severe thrombocytopenia. The JAK2/STAT3 pathway may play a role in megakaryocyte differentiation and platelet biogenesis, contributing to immune resistance and tumor progression.\n\nInterpretation: The combination of RT and ICI in metastatic esophageal cancer patients may lead to severe thrombocytopenia and tumor progression, potentially mediated by the JAK2/STAT3 pathway. These findings highlight the need for careful monitoring of patients receiving this treatment combination and suggest that increased JAK2 gene copies may be a risk factor for poor prognosis.\n\nTrial registration: Not provided.\n\nFunding: Supported by Chongqing Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine.",
