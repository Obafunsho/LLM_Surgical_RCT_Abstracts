This study aimed to evaluate the safety and feasibility of preoperative exercise training during neoadjuvant treatment.\n\nMethods: This non-randomised, controlled feasibility study was conducted at Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen University Hospital. Patients with resectable GOJ adenocarcinoma were allocated to either a standard-care control group or an exercise group, which included twice-weekly high-intensity aerobic and resistance training. The primary outcome was the incidence of serious adverse events (SAEs) preventing surgery, measured from the start of neoadjuvant treatment to surgery. Secondary outcomes included preoperative hospital admission, postoperative complications, and changes in quality of life. \n\nResults: Between April 2016 and May 2017, 62 patients were enrolled, with 21 in the exercise group and 29 in the control group. The risk of failure to reach surgery was 5% in the exercise group versus 21% in the control group (risk ratio 0.23, 95% CI 0.04 to 1.29). The risk of preoperative hospital admission was 15% versus 38% (risk ratio 0.39, 95% CI 0.12 to 1.23). The risk of postoperative complications was similar between groups, at 58% in the exercise group and 57% in the control group (risk ratio 1.06, 95% CI 0.61 to 1.73). No increase in SAEs was observed in the exercise group. \n\nInterpretation: Preoperative exercise training during neoadjuvant treatment in patients with GOJ cancer is safe and feasible, potentially reducing the risk of critical SAEs that preclude surgery or result in hospitalization.
