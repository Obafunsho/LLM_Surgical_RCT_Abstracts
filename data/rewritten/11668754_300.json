A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial on the Effects of CPB-Induced Shear Stress on Monocyte-Endothelial Interactions\n\nBackground: Cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) is associated with systemic inflammation, leading to significant morbidity and mortality, especially in pediatric patients. This study aims to elucidate the effects of CPB-induced shear stress on monocyte-endothelial interactions.\n\nMethods: In this in vitro randomised controlled trial, THP-1 monocyte-like cells and human neonatal dermal microvascular endothelial cells (HNDMVECs) were used. THP-1 cells were exposed to shear stress in polyvinyl chloride tubing at 2.1 Pa for 2 hours. ELISA, adhesion and transmigration assays, qPCR, and RNA silencing were utilized to evaluate interactions after co-culture. The primary outcome was IL-8 production and monocyte adhesion, assessed over a 6-hour period.\n\nResults: Sheared THP-1 cells demonstrated increased adhesion and transmigration through the HNDMVEC monolayer compared to static controls. Disruption of VE-cadherin and reorganization of cytoskeletal F-actin were noted in HNDMVECs. Higher IL-8 levels were found in the sheared THP-1 and HNDMVEC co-culture medium. IL-8 treatment of HNDMVECs resulted in increased adherence of non-sheared THP-1 cells and upregulation of VCAM-1 and ICAM-1. Inhibition of CXCR2/IL-8 receptor with Reparixin and IL-8 expression with siRNA blocked sheared THP-1 cell adhesion.\n\nInterpretation: CPB-like shear stress on monocytes induces IL-8 production, leading to increased endothelial permeability and monocyte adhesion. This study reveals a novel mechanism of post-CPB inflammation, highlighting potential therapeutic targets to prevent and repair damage in neonatal patients. Further research is needed to explore the clinical implications and develop targeted interventions.",
