A 300-word version\n\nTitle: A Randomised Controlled Trial Comparing Hip Resurfacing and Large-Head Total Hip Arthroplasty in Young and Active Patients with Hip Osteoarthritis\n\nBackground: Hip resurfacing (HR) is proposed to offer superior functional outcomes compared to conventional total hip arthroplasty (THA) in young, active patients with hip osteoarthritis. This study aimed to evaluate the functional outcomes of HR versus large-diameter femoral head THA.\n\nMethods: This double-blind, randomised controlled trial was conducted at a single orthopedic center. Forty-eight patients with hip osteoarthritis, selected based on age and activity level, were randomised to receive either HR or large-head THA. Randomisation was computer-generated, and allocation was concealed. Blinding included patients, clinicians, and outcome assessors. The primary outcome was gait speed, assessed preoperatively and at 3, 6, and 12 months postoperatively. A third group of 14 healthy subjects served as controls.\n\nResults: Forty-eight patients were randomised: 24 to HR and 24 to large-head THA. All participants were analysed using an intention-to-treat approach. Gait speed and postural balance evaluations, functional tests, and clinical scores were similar between HR and large-head THA groups at all follow-up periods. Operated patients reached most control group values by 3 months postoperatively. No significant differences in adverse events were reported between groups. The effect size for gait speed was not significantly different between HR and large-head THA (mean difference = X, 95% CI Y to Z; p = 0.XX).\n\nInterpretation: HR did not demonstrate superior clinical function over large-head THA in young, active patients with hip osteoarthritis. The findings suggest that the choice between HR and large-head THA should consider factors other than functional outcomes. Trial registration: [Trial registration number].
