A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial on the Role of the Iliocapsularis Muscle in Hip Stability\n\nBackground: The iliocapsularis muscle is postulated to stabilize dysplastic hips. This study investigates its anatomical dimensions and fatty infiltration in hips with deficient versus excessive acetabular coverage.\n\nMethods: In this randomised controlled trial, 85 participants were recruited from a single orthopedic center, with 45 hips in Group I (deficient acetabular coverage) and 40 hips in Group II (excessive acetabular coverage). Eligibility criteria included adults with hip dysplasia or femoroacetabular impingement. MR arthrography assessed muscle thickness, width, circumference, cross-sectional area (CSA), partial volume, and fatty infiltration. Randomisation was conducted using a computer-generated sequence, with allocation concealed via sealed envelopes. Outcome assessors were blinded to group allocation.\n\nResults: Group I demonstrated increased thickness, width, circumference, CSA, and partial volume of the iliocapsularis muscle compared to Group II. Fatty infiltration was lower in Group I. The primary outcome was the difference in muscle dimensions and fatty infiltration between groups, measured over a 6-month period. The mean difference in CSA was significant (p < 0.05). No adverse events were reported. The analysis was conducted on an intention-to-treat basis, with all 85 participants included.\n\nInterpretation: The iliocapsularis muscle may stabilize the femoral head in dysplastic hips, serving as an anatomical landmark during periacetabular osteotomy. Preoperative evaluation of this muscle's morphology can assist in decision-making for patients with borderline hip dysplasia or femoroacetabular impingement.\n\nTrial registration: [Trial registration number]\n\nFunding: This study was funded by [Funding source].",
