A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Two-Stage Goal-Directed Crystalloid vs. Colloid Fluid Therapy in Laparoscopic Hepatectomy: A Randomised Controlled Trial\n\nBackground: This randomised controlled trial assessed the effects of two-stage goal-directed crystalloid versus colloid fluid therapy on postoperative recovery quality in laparoscopic hepatectomy patients.\n\nMethods: Conducted at the Affiliated Hospital of Xuzhou Medical University, 116 patients aged 18-65 years, ASA I-III, were randomised 1:1 to receive either balanced salt solution with 6% hydroxyethyl starch (colloid group) or balanced salt solution alone (crystalloid group). The primary outcome was the Quality of Recovery-15 (QoR-15) score at 24 hours postoperatively. Randomisation used a random number table, with allocation concealed via opaque envelopes. Blinding included patients, outcome assessors, and statisticians. The sample size was calculated to detect a 6-point difference in QoR-15 scores, assuming α = 0.05 and 1-β = 0.8.\n\nResults: 58 patients were analysed per group using a per-protocol approach. No significant difference was found in QoR-15 scores between groups (p > 0.05). The colloid group had lower postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) scores at 24 and 48 hours, fewer rescue fluid infusions, and a lower total fluid volume (p < 0.05). Multiple linear regression indicated that estimated blood loss (β = −0.268, p = 0.005) and PONV scores (β = −0.176, p = 0.045) were negatively associated with recovery. No significant adverse events were reported.\n\nInterpretation: Two-stage goal-directed crystalloid versus colloid fluid therapy showed no significant difference in postoperative recovery quality. Colloids may reduce PONV, warranting further investigation. Trial registration: ChiCTR2400087179. Funding: Not specified. Further large-scale trials are needed to confirm these findings.",
