This study aims to evaluate the impact of PTR on 60-day mortality.\n\nMethods: CAIRO4 is a multicenter, randomised phase 3 trial conducted in Denmark and the Netherlands. Patients with histologically proven mCRC, unresectable metastases, and minimal symptoms were randomised to systemic treatment only or PTR followed by systemic treatment. The primary outcome was 60-day mortality. Randomisation was computer-generated, and allocation was concealed. Blinding was not applicable.\n\nResults: A total of 196 patients were randomised between August 2012 and December 2019, with 98 in each group. In the intention-to-treat analysis, 60-day mortality was 3% (95% CI, 1%-9%) in the systemic treatment group and 11% (95% CI, 6%-19%) in the PTR group (P = .03). Per-protocol analysis showed 60-day mortality of 2% (95% CI, 1%-7%) vs 10% (95% CI, 5%-18%; P = .048). Elevated serum levels of lactate dehydrogenase, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, and/or neutrophils were associated with higher mortality in the PTR group.\n\nInterpretation: PTR followed by systemic treatment resulted in higher 60-day mortality compared to systemic treatment alone. Patients with elevated serum markers were at increased risk. Further research is needed to assess overall survival.\n\nTrial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01606098\n\nFunding: Not specified.",
