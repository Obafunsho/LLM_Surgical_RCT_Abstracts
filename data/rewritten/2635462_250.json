A 250-word version\n\nTitle: A Randomised Controlled Trial of an Aspirator Retractor for Enhancing Cement Fixation in Hip Arthroplasty\n\nBackground: The quality of technique during socket cementation is crucial for implant longevity. This study evaluates whether an aspirator retractor improves cement fixation in hip arthroplasty.\n\nMethods: This randomised controlled trial included 38 patients undergoing hip arthroplasty, conducted at a single orthopedic center. Participants were randomly assigned to either the intervention group using an aspirator retractor or a control group with standard technique. Randomisation was computer-generated, and allocation was concealed using sealed envelopes. The primary outcome was cement fixation assessed by radiostereometry and radiographic examination over a minimum of 2 years. Blinding was applied to outcome assessors.\n\nResults: 19 patients were randomised to each group. Analysis was conducted on all participants using an intention-to-treat approach. There was no significant difference in proximal migration between groups. The intervention group showed no improvement in fixation, as measured by translations and rotations of the socket. Radiolucent lines and cement penetration depth were similar between groups. No adverse events were reported in either group.\n\nInterpretation: The use of an aspirator retractor did not enhance cement fixation in the short term. Further follow-up is needed to assess long-term outcomes. The device may still offer technical advantages during pressurization.\n\nTrial registration: [Trial registration number]\n\nFunding: [Source of funding]",
