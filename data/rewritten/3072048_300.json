This study aimed to explore this mechanism.\n\nMethods: In this randomised controlled trial, 16 patients with advanced idiopathic Parkinson's disease were recruited from multiple surgical centers. Eligibility required evidence of pathological synchrony in the subthalamic region. Bilateral STN DBS electrodes were implanted, and recordings were made during stimulation using a custom amplifier. The primary outcome was the suppression of local field potential (LFP) activity in the 11–30 Hz range, measured over a few days post-implantation. Randomisation and allocation concealment methods were not specified. Blinding was not implemented for clinical assessments. The intervention involved DBS with varying voltages, while no comparator was used.\n\nResults: DBS progressively suppressed LFP peaks between 11 and 30 Hz as voltage increased beyond 1.5 V, with median peak power reduced to 54% of baseline at 3.0 V. No adverse events were reported.\n\nInterpretation: DBS can suppress pathological 11–30 Hz activity at clinically effective voltages, suggesting a potential mechanism for its therapeutic effects in Parkinson's disease. The study highlights the importance of targeting pathological synchrony in the STN region for effective DBS treatment.\n\nTrial registration: Not provided.\n\nFunding: Not specified.",
