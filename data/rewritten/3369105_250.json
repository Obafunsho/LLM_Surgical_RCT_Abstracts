A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial on Training to Improve Diagnosis of Scaphoid Fracture Displacement\n\nBackground: Diagnosing displacement in scaphoid fractures is challenging due to poor interobserver reliability. This study evaluates whether training can enhance interobserver reliability and diagnostic accuracy for scaphoid fracture displacement on radiographs and CT scans.\n\nMethods: In this randomised controlled trial, 64 orthopaedic surgeons were randomised into a training group (34) and a nontraining group (30) to assess 10 displaced and 10 nondisplaced scaphoid fractures using a web-based application. The training group received an online module before assessment. Interobserver reliability was measured using Siegel’s multirater kappa, and the Z-test assessed significance. Sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy were calculated.\n\nResults: The training group showed a small but significant improvement in interobserver reliability compared to the nontraining group. Combined radiograph and CT scan ratings resulted in moderate agreement for both groups. Sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy were 87%, 86%, and 87% for the training group, and 83%, 85%, and 84% for the nontraining group. Positive predictive value was 0.25 for the training group and 0.23 for the nontraining group, with a negative predictive value of 0.99 for both.\n\nInterpretation: Training slightly improves interobserver reliability and diagnostic accuracy for scaphoid fracture displacement. These findings support further research to reduce interobserver variation.",
