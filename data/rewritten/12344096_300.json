A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Synthetic Angiotensin-II in Severe Burn Injury\n\nBackground: Severe burn injury poses significant clinical challenges, often necessitating vasoactive agents to maintain perfusion. This study evaluates the efficacy and safety of synthetic angiotensin-II (AT-II) compared to standard catecholamine-based therapy in acute burn shock resuscitation and septic shock in burn patients.\n\nMethods: This randomised controlled trial was conducted in a tertiary care burn unit. Participants were adults with severe burn injury requiring vasoactive support. Eligibility criteria included age over 18 and burn injury covering more than 20% of total body surface area. Randomisation was performed using a computer-generated sequence with allocation concealment via sealed envelopes. Blinding was applied to outcome assessors. The intervention group received synthetic AT-II, while the control group received standard catecholamine-based therapy. The primary outcome was mean arterial pressure (MAP) improvement within 24 hours.\n\nResults: A total of 200 participants were randomised: 100 to the AT-II group and 100 to the control group, between January 2020 and June 2021. Analysis was conducted on 98 participants in the AT-II group and 97 in the control group using an intention-to-treat approach. The AT-II group showed a significant improvement in MAP (mean difference = 5.2 mm Hg, 95% CI 3.1 to 7.3; p = 0.01). Adverse events were reported in 3% of the AT-II group and 1% of the control group, primarily mild gastrointestinal side-effects.\n\nInterpretation: Synthetic AT-II significantly improves hemodynamics in severe burn injury compared to standard care, with a manageable safety profile. These findings suggest a potential role for AT-II in burn shock management, warranting further investigation.\n\nTrial registration: NCT12345678\n\nFunding: This trial was funded by the National Institutes of Health.",
