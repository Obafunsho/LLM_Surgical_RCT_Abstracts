This study evaluates a novel chlorogenic acid–strontium (SrCA)-loaded polycaprolactone bioresorbable eStent.\n\nMethods: In a randomised controlled trial, Sprague–Dawley rats (n=12) were assigned to either the SrCA eStent group or a control group with non-stented vein grafts. The primary outcome was neointimal thickness reduction at 4 weeks. Randomisation was computer-generated, and allocation was concealed. Blinding was applied to outcome assessors.\n\nResults: At 4 weeks, the SrCA eStent group showed a significant reduction in neointimal thickness compared to controls (mean difference = 0.15 mm, 95% CI 0.10 to 0.20; p < 0.01). The SrCA eStent inhibited VSMC proliferation and enhanced endothelial repair via Hippo-YAP signaling. No adverse events were reported.\n\nInterpretation: The SrCA eStent effectively reduces vein graft restenosis by combining mechanical support and biodegradability, offering a promising strategy for long-term graft patency.\n\nTrial registration: Not provided.\n\nFunding: Supported by institutional grants.",
