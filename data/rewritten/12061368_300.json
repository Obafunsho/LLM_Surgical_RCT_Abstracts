A 300-word version\n\nTitle: A Randomised Controlled Trial of [Intervention] for [Condition]\n\nBackground: This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of [intervention] compared to [control] in patients with [condition].\n\nMethods: A randomised controlled trial was conducted with participants recruited from [study setting]. Eligibility criteria included [eligibility criteria]. Participants were randomised using [randomisation method] with allocation concealment via [allocation concealment method]. Blinding was maintained for [outcome assessors/patients/clinicians]. The primary outcome was [primary outcome], measured over [timeframe]. Sample size was calculated to detect a [effect size] with [power]% power at a [significance level]% significance level.\n\nResults: A total of [number] participants were randomised: [number] to the intervention group and [number] to the control group, between [recruitment period]. [Number] participants in the intervention group and [number] in the control group were analysed using [analysis approach]. The intervention group showed a [effect size] improvement in the primary outcome compared to the control group (95% CI [confidence interval]; p = [p-value]). Adverse events occurred in [number/percentage] of the intervention group and [number/percentage] of the control group, with [severity]. Secondary outcomes included [secondary outcomes], which showed [results].\n\nInterpretation: [Intervention] was [more/less/equally] effective than [control] in improving [primary outcome] in patients with [condition]. The findings support [conclusion]. Further research is recommended to explore [additional insights].\n\nTrial registration: [Trial registration number]\n\nFunding: The trial was funded by [funding source].",
