The primary outcome was the incidence of outliers in postoperative hip-knee-ankle angles, assessed within 6 weeks post-surgery. Secondary outcomes included femoral component rotation and coronal and sagittal alignments. Randomisation was performed using a computer-generated sequence, with allocation concealment via sealed envelopes. Outcome assessors were blinded to group allocation. The trial was conducted at a single orthopedic center, with recruitment from January 2020 to June 2021. An intention-to-treat analysis was applied.\n\nResults: The incidence of outliers in hip-knee-ankle angles was similar between groups, with 12% in the patient-specific group and 10% in the conventional group (p=0.75). No significant differences were observed in femoral component rotation or coronal and sagittal alignments. Patient-specific guides were abandoned in 8 cases (16%) due to malrotation of the femoral components and decreased tibial slope. No severe adverse events were reported in either group.\n\nInterpretation: The use of patient-specific instrumentation in TKA did not result in superior accuracy compared to conventional methods and was frequently abandoned during surgery, indicating no additional benefit to patients. These findings suggest that the added cost of patient-specific instruments may not be justified. Trial registration: NCT12345678. Funding: Supported by [Funding Source].",
