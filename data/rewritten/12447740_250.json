The primary outcome was incision length, measured immediately post-surgery. Randomisation and allocation concealment methods were not specified. Blinding details were not provided. Data were analyzed using Stata 15.1 and the Gemtc 1.0.1 package in R 4.2.3.\n\nResults: ENSM with IPBR resulted in a significantly smaller incision (WMD: -5.57 cm, 95% CI: -10.74 to -0.69) compared to CNSM. RNSM with IPBR showed a lower incidence of total complications (WMD: 0.73, 95% CI: 0.61–0.88) and recurrence (WMD: 0.060, 95% CI: 0.0018–0.47) than CNSM. CNSM with IPBR had better outcomes in surgical time and hospital stay. Adverse events were not detailed.\n\nInterpretation: RNSM and ENSM with IPBR offer superior outcomes in incision length, complication rates, and recurrence compared to CNSM. Further high-quality trials are needed to confirm these findings.\n\nTrial registration: osf.io/5j3dk\n\nFunding: Not specified.",
