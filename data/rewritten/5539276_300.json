The primary outcome was the percentage of patients receiving radical treatment of all tumor sites, assessed over a median follow-up of 8.1 years. Randomisation and allocation concealment methods were not applicable as this was an open-label study. Blinding was not implemented. Follow-up data were collected for all patients.\n\nResults: All 50 patients were analyzed. After a median follow-up of 8.1 years, 16 patients (32%) were alive, and 14 (28%) were disease-free. Median overall survival was 3.8 years. Among 36 patients who received radical treatment, 2 (5.6%) had local recurrence, and 29 (80.6%) had distant recurrence. The 2-year survival rate was 74%, and the 5-year survival rate was 38%. Adverse events were not detailed in the manuscript.\n\nInterpretation: Long-term survival is achievable in patients with primary metastatic rectal cancer using this neoadjuvant treatment strategy, despite a high recurrence rate. The study highlights the potential for achieving local control and long-term survival in a population with poor prognostic features. Trial registration: NTR2029. Funding: Not specified.",
