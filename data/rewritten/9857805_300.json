This study evaluates the cost-effectiveness of fibrinogen concentrate (FC) compared to cryoprecipitate in managing active bleeding in adult cardiac surgery patients.\n\nMethods: This within-trial economic evaluation was part of the Fibrinogen Replenishment in Surgery (FIBERS) randomised clinical trial conducted at four Ontario hospitals from February 2017 to November 2018. Participants included 495 adult patients with acquired hypofibrinogenemia post-cardiac surgery. Patients were randomised (1:1) to receive either FC (4 g per dose) or cryoprecipitate (10 units per dose) within 24 hours post-cardiopulmonary bypass. The primary outcome was the number of allogeneic blood products (ABPs) administered within 7 days. Randomisation was computer-generated, and allocation was concealed. Blinding was not specified.\n\nResults: A total of 495 patients were analysed (mean age 59.2 years, 69.3% male). Consistent with the FIBERS trial, ABP transfusions and adverse events were similar in both treatment groups. Median 7-day ABP costs were CAD $2280 for FC and CAD $2770 for cryoprecipitate. Median 28-day total costs were CAD $38,180 for FC and CAD $38,790 for cryoprecipitate. After excluding critically ill patients, the incremental net benefit of FC was positive, with an 86% probability of cost-effectiveness at $0 willingness-to-pay and 97% at CAD $2000. Adverse events were similar across groups.\n\nInterpretation: FC is cost-effective compared to cryoprecipitate in most bleeding adult cardiac surgery patients. The generalizability of these findings outside the Canadian health system needs verification. Further studies are needed to confirm these results in different healthcare settings.\n\nTrial registration: NCT03037424\n\nFunding: Not specified.",
