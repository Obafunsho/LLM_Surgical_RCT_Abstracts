A 250-word version\n\nTitle: A Randomised Controlled Trial of Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass vs. Intensive Medical Management for Type 2 Diabetes\n\nBackground: Bariatric surgery is emerging as a therapeutic strategy for type 2 diabetes mellitus. This study aims to assess the feasibility of conducting a larger trial to evaluate the long-term effects of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) compared to an intensive diabetes medical and weight management program (Why WAIT).\n\nMethods: This 1-year pragmatic randomised clinical trial was conducted at an academic medical institution. Participants aged 21-65 years with type 2 diabetes diagnosed over a year prior, a BMI of 30-42, and HbA1c ≥6.5% were included. Participants were randomised to RYGB (n=19) or Why WAIT (n=19). The primary outcome was the proportion of patients achieving fasting plasma glucose <126 mg/dL and HbA1c <6.5% at 1 year. Randomisation was performed using a computer-generated sequence with allocation concealment. Blinding was not applied.\n\nResults: At 1 year, 58% of RYGB patients achieved the primary outcome compared to 16% in the Why WAIT group (P=0.03). RYGB resulted in greater improvements in HbA1c, weight, waist circumference, fat mass, lean mass, blood pressure, triglycerides, and HDL cholesterol. Quality of life improvements were similar between groups, except for greater weight-related quality of life improvement in RYGB.\n\nInterpretation: RYGB leads to greater weight loss and cardiometabolic improvements compared to medical management in obese patients with type 2 diabetes. Both treatments enhance general quality of life, but RYGB offers superior weight-related quality of life benefits. These findings may guide therapeutic decisions until larger trials are conducted.",
