A 300-word version\n\nTitle: A Randomised Controlled Trial Comparing Costs of Open vs Endovascular Repair of Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm\n\nBackground: This study aimed to evaluate the costs associated with different endograft systems used in endovascular repair (EVR) of abdominal aortic aneurysm compared to open repair, focusing on device, repair, and total health care costs.\n\nMethods: In this randomised controlled trial, 881 patients were randomised to open repair (n = 437) or EVR (n = 444) at Veterans Affairs (VA) hospitals. Device selection was recorded before randomisation, allowing open repair controls to be matched to each device cohort. Two low-volume devices were excluded, leaving 423 control and 431 endovascular patients: 166 Zenith, 177 Excluder, and 88 AneuRx. The primary outcome was the total health care cost from randomisation to 2 years. Health care utilisation data were obtained from patients and national VA and Medicare data sources. VA costs were determined using methods developed by the VA Health Economics Resource Center, and non-VA costs were obtained from Medicare claims data. Randomisation and allocation concealment methods were not specified. Blinding details were not provided.\n\nResults: Implant costs accounted for 38% of initial hospitalisation costs. Mean device, initial hospitalisation, and total health care costs at 2 years were not significantly different among device systems. Differences between EVR and open repair cohorts showed lower mean costs for EVR, but these were not statistically significant. No adverse events were reported.\n\nInterpretation: The implant costs of EVR are substantial, with no significant difference in total health care costs at 2 years among systems or when compared to open repair. There is large individual variability in costs.\n\nTrial registration: Not provided.\n\nFunding: Not specified.",
