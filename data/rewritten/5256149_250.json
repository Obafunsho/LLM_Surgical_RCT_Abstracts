Eligible patients were adults with acute ischaemic stroke, confirmed large artery occlusion on CT angiography, and IVT initiated within 4.5 hours of symptom onset. Participants were randomised 1:1 to receive IVT alone or IVT plus MT. Randomisation was performed using a minimisation algorithm, and outcome assessors were blinded. The primary outcome was independence at day 90, defined by a modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score of 0–2.\n\nResults: Sixty-five patients were randomised between April 2013 and April 2015, with 32 receiving IVT alone and 33 receiving IVT plus MT. In the intention-to-treat analysis, no significant difference was observed in the primary outcome (adjusted OR 2.12, 95% CI 0.65 to 6.94, p=0.20). However, secondary analyses showed a greater likelihood of full neurological recovery (mRS 0–1) at day 90 with MT (OR 7.6, 95% CI 1.6 to 37.2, p=0.010). In the per-protocol population, MT significantly improved outcomes (adjusted OR 4.9, 95% CI 1.2 to 19.7, p=0.021).\n\nInterpretation: While the primary outcome was not significantly different, MT improved secondary outcomes and was safe.
