Eligible participants were children undergoing surgical procedures requiring anesthesia. Participants were randomly assigned to receive either propofol or a comparator anesthetic. Randomisation was achieved using a computer-generated sequence, with allocation concealment via sealed envelopes. Blinding was applied to outcome assessors, patients, and clinicians.\n\nIntervention: The intervention group received propofol, while the control group received an alternative anesthetic. The primary outcome was the depth of anesthesia, assessed using EEG signals over a 24-hour period.\n\nResults: A total of 200 participants were randomised, with 100 in each group. Analysis included 98 participants in the intervention group and 97 in the control group, following an intention-to-treat approach. The mean difference in depth of anesthesia was 5.2 units (95% CI 3.1 to 7.3; p = 0.01). Adverse events occurred in 3% of the intervention group and 1% of the control group, with mild gastrointestinal side-effects reported.\n\nInterpretation: Propofol significantly enhanced the depth of anesthesia compared to the control, demonstrating a favorable safety profile. The findings support the use of propofol in pediatric anesthesia and underscore its role in the development of infusion pump technology. The study also highlights the environmental benefits of propofol over inhalational agents, given the carbon footprint concerns.\n\nTrial registration: NCT12345678\n\nFunding: This trial was funded by the National Institute of Health.",
