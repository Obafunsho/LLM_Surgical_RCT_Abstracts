A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Postoperative Perturbation Training on Gait Mechanics After ACL Reconstruction\n\nBackground: Movement asymmetries post-ACL reconstruction may contribute to posttraumatic osteoarthritis. This study evaluates the effect of postoperative perturbation training on gait mechanics.\n\nMethods: In this randomised controlled trial, 40 men post-ACL reconstruction were randomised to strength, agility, and secondary prevention (SAP) or SAP plus perturbation training (SAP+PERT). Participants were recruited from a single orthopedic clinic, meeting criteria of ≥80% quadriceps strength symmetry, minimal knee effusion, full ROM, no pain, and completion of a running progression. Randomisation was computer-generated with allocation concealment. Blinding was applied to outcome assessors. Gait mechanics were assessed at 1 and 2 years postoperatively, focusing on sagittal and frontal plane hip and knee angles and moments. The primary outcome was elimination of gait asymmetries.\n\nResults: No significant differences were found between SAP and SAP+PERT groups in biomechanical gait variables. At 1 year, 11 of 18 SAP and 11 of 20 SAP+PERT athletes showed truncated knee excursions during weight acceptance (odds ratio: 0.8, p = 0.70). At 2 years, asymmetries persisted with 7 of 17 SAP and 8 of 19 SAP+PERT athletes affected (odds ratio: 1.0, p = 0.96). No adverse events were reported.\n\nInterpretation: Postoperative perturbation training did not significantly improve gait symmetry compared to SAP alone. Persistent asymmetries suggest additional interventions are needed. Trial registration: [Number]. Funding: [Source].",
