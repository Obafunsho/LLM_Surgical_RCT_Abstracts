  "abstract": "250-word version:\n\nBackground: This study aimed to provide evidence-based guidance for managing multiple trauma in mountain environments, where increased morbidity and mortality are observed compared to urban settings.\n\nMethods: A PRISMA Scoping Review was conducted, including all articles published on or before September 30th, 2019. Searches were performed in PubMed, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and through hand searching of relevant studies. Recommendations were developed and graded according to the American College of Chest Physicians' evidence-grading system.\n\nResults: A total of 247 articles met the inclusion criteria. Eighty-four recommendations were developed, focusing on the crABCDE approach, with haemorrhage control as a priority, followed by basic first aid, splinting, immobilisation, analgesia, and insulation. The importance of balancing on-site medical treatment time with rapid transfer to a trauma centre was emphasized. Helicopter rescue was highlighted as a means to reduce on-scene times. Advanced diagnostics, such as ultrasound, were recommended for use during transport.\n\nInterpretation: Managing multiple trauma in mountain environments is challenging, requiring prioritization of rescuer and victim safety. The crABCDE approach is central, and rapid transfer to a trauma centre is crucial. Helicopter rescue and advanced diagnostics can improve outcomes. The study provides comprehensive recommendations to optimize care in these settings.",
