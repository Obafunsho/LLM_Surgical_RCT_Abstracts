A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Perioperative Cognitive Training in Older Cardiac Surgery Patients\n\nBackground: Postoperative delirium and cognitive dysfunction (POCD) are common after cardiac surgery, leading to increased complications and mortality. This study investigates the feasibility and potential efficacy of a perioperative cognitive training (CT) program to mitigate these conditions.\n\nMethods: Conducted at a single tertiary care center, this randomised controlled trial involved 45 adults aged 60–90 undergoing cardiac surgery at least 10 days post-enrollment. Participants were randomised 1:1 to either perioperative CT via a mobile device or usual care. The primary outcome was feasibility, evaluated by enrollment and adherence. Secondary outcomes included postoperative delirium and POCD, assessed using the Confusion Assessment Method and Montreal Cognitive Assessment. Patient satisfaction was measured postoperatively. Randomisation was computer-generated, with allocation concealment via sealed envelopes. Blinding was not applied to participants or outcome assessors.\n\nResults: Sixty-five percent of eligible patients were enrolled. Median adherence was 39% preoperatively, 6% immediately postoperatively, and 19% post-discharge. Median training times were 245, 18, and 122 minutes for each period, respectively. The incidence of delirium was 25% in the CT group versus 15% in controls (P = .69), and POCD was 53% versus 37% (P = .33). CT participants reported higher satisfaction with memory and thinking improvements. No adverse events were reported.\n\nInterpretation: The CT program is a promising target for cognitive prehabilitation in older cardiac surgery patients. Enhancements in program functionality and adherence are needed for future trials. Further research is necessary to determine the efficacy of cognitive prehabilitation in reducing postoperative delirium and POCD.\n\nTrial registration: [Trial registration number]\n\nFunding: [Source of funding]",
