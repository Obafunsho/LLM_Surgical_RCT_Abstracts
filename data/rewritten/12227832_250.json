A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Tranexamic Acid in Reducing Blood Loss During Nephrectomy for Wilms Tumor in Children\n\nBackground: Nephrectomy for Wilms tumor often results in significant intraoperative blood loss. This study evaluates the efficacy of tranexamic acid (TXA) in reducing blood loss during this procedure.\n\nMethods: This prospective, randomised controlled trial was conducted at a tertiary healthcare center in India. Sixty children under 10 years with Wilms tumor scheduled for elective nephrectomy were randomised into two groups: TXA group (n=30) received 50 mg/kg TXA intravenously, followed by 5 mg/kg/h infusion; NS group (n=30) received an equivalent volume of normal saline. Randomisation was performed using a computer-generated sequence with allocation concealment via sealed envelopes. Both patients and outcome assessors were blinded. The primary outcome was intraoperative blood loss, measured during surgery. Secondary outcomes included PRBC transfusion volume and intraoperative hemodynamic parameters.\n\nResults: The TXA group had significantly lower intraoperative blood loss (216.33 mL vs 306.33 mL; p=0.001) and PRBC transfusion volume (167.0 mL vs 199.8 mL; p=0.045). Serum lactate levels were lower in the TXA group (1.82 mmol/L vs 2.63 mmol/L; p=0.001). No adverse events were reported in either group.\n\nInterpretation: TXA significantly reduces intraoperative blood loss and transfusion requirements in children undergoing nephrectomy for Wilms tumor without increasing adverse events.
