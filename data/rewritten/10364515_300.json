Participants were randomised to SAP or TAP using an automated service, with allocation concealment. Blinding was not feasible for patients or clinicians due to procedural differences. The primary outcome was the VEINES-QOL/Sym score at 12 months. Secondary outcomes included cost-effectiveness, perceived improvement, and anatomical success.\n\nResults: From January 2015 to December 2018, 464 patients were randomised (SAP 227, TAP 237) and analysed using an intention-to-treat approach. VEINES-QOL scores were 52.7 (95% CI 51.9 to 53.9) for SAP and 53.8 (53.3 to 55.1) for TAP. Fifty-eight patients (25.6%) in the SAP group required additional truncal ablation. SAP was less costly than TAP, with treatment costs of €1030 (95% CI 885 to 1092) compared to €1660 (1544 to 1779) for TAP. Adverse events were minor and similar between groups, with 25 events in SAP and 22 in TAP.\n\nInterpretation: SAP was non-inferior to TAP in terms of health-related quality of life at 12 months and was a cost-effective alternative. The trial supports SAP as a viable treatment option, reducing costs and potentially sparing patients from additional procedures. Trial registration: NTR 4821.
