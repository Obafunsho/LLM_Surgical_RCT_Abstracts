A 300-word version\n\nTitle: A Randomised Controlled Trial Comparing Postoperative Immune Function in Minimal Access Breast Surgery and Conventional Open Breast Surgery\n\nBackground: Minimal access breast surgery (MABS) is commonly employed in breast cancer management, yet its effects on postoperative immune function are not well understood.\n\nMethods: This retrospective study analyzed 829 breast cancer patients treated with MABS or conventional open breast surgery (COBS) at a single hospital from June 2020 to July 2023. Eligibility criteria included female patients aged 18-75 with cancer stages 0-III and no prior surgery. Propensity score matching (PSM) was used to obtain 116 matched pairs. The primary outcome was postoperative immune function, assessed by CD3+, CD4+, and CD8+ lymphocyte percentages and CD4+/CD8+ ratio, measured on preoperative day 1 (PreD1), postoperative day 1 (PostD1), and postoperative day 7 (PostD7) using flow cytometry.\n\nResults: Both MABS and COBS groups showed significant reductions in CD3+, CD4+, and CD8+ percentages and CD4+/CD8+ ratio from PreD1 to PostD1. By PostD7, the MABS group returned to preoperative levels, while the COBS group remained significantly lower. No significant differences in postoperative complications were observed between groups. MABS was associated with less intraoperative blood loss, shorter extubation time, and reduced hospital stays.\n\nInterpretation: MABS may result in reduced postoperative immune suppression and faster recovery of immune function compared to COBS. These findings suggest potential advantages of MABS in enhancing postoperative recovery. Further randomized trials are needed to confirm these results and explore the underlying mechanisms. No significant adverse events were reported. The study was not registered, and funding sources were not disclosed.",
