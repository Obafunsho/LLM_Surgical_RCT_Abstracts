A 250-word version\n\nTitle: A Randomised Controlled Trial Comparing Short- and Standard-Length Stems in Cementless Total Hip Arthroplasty\n\nBackground: Short-length stems in cementless total hip arthroplasty (THA) were developed to reduce proximal femur bone loss and decrease thigh pain. This study evaluates the efficacy of short stems compared to standard-length stems.\n\nMethods: In this randomised controlled trial, 100 patients undergoing primary THA were randomised to receive either a short stem (n = 56) or a standard-length stem (n = 44) between March 2013 and January 2014. Eligibility criteria included age ≥20 years, no prior hip surgery, and absence of metabolic bone disease. The primary outcome was the incidence of thigh pain over a 5-year follow-up. Randomisation was computer-generated, and allocation was concealed. Outcome assessors were blinded. Analysis was per-protocol.\n\nResults: Thigh pain was reported in 16% (9/56) of the short-stem group and 14% (6/44) of the standard-stem group (p = 0.79). The mean severity of thigh pain was similar between groups (4.3 ± 0.8 vs. 4.2 ± 0.7; p = 0.78). Modified Harris hip scores were not significantly different (89 ± 13 vs. 95 ± 7; p = 0.06). No implant loosening or revisions occurred. Bone mineral density changes were slightly less in the short-stem group but not clinically significant.\n\nInterpretation: No clinically important differences were found between short and standard-length stems in THA. Standard-length stems are recommended due to their established track record.\n\nTrial registration: [Trial registration number]\n\nFunding: [Source of funding]",
