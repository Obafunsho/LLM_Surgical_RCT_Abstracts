A 300-word version\n\nTitle: A Randomised Controlled Trial of Delayed Autologous Treg Therapy in Kidney Transplant Recipients\n\nBackground: This randomised controlled trial investigated the safety and efficacy of delayed autologous regulatory T-cell (Treg) therapy in living donor kidney transplant recipients, following alemtuzumab induction. The study aimed to determine if this approach could enable safe immunosuppression minimization to tacrolimus monotherapy.\n\nMethods: Conducted at a single center in the UK, the trial included first-time kidney transplant recipients, excluding high immunological risk patients. Participants were randomized to receive either Treg therapy at 26 weeks post-transplantation with tacrolimus weaning or standard immunosuppression with tacrolimus and mycophenolate mofetil. The primary outcome was graft survival and acute rejection-free survival within 18 months. Randomization was computer-generated, and allocation was concealed. Blinding was not applied.\n\nResults: Seven participants were randomized, with three receiving Treg therapy. All participants completed the study. Graft survival was 100% in both groups, and acute rejection-free survival was 100% in the Treg group. A transient increase in peripheral Treg numbers was observed post-infusion. No severe adverse events were reported, although one Treg recipient experienced transient proteinuria, and one control experienced tacrolimus toxicity. Mild cytomegalovirus disease occurred in one participant from each group, resolving with treatment.\n\nTrial registration: ISRCTN11038572.\n\nFunding: The study was funded by institutional grants.",
