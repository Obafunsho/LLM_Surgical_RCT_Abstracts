The primary outcomes were all-cause mortality and cardiovascular mortality, measured over a follow-up period. Randomisation methods and allocation concealment varied across studies. Blinding details were not consistently reported.\n\nResults: A+T was associated with a decreased risk of all-cause mortality (OR=0.47, 95% CI 0.31–0.70, p<0.001) and cardiovascular mortality (OR=0.50, 95% CI 0.31–0.82, p=0.006) compared to A+C. No significant difference was found in major bleeding rates (OR=1.16; 95% CI 0.69–1.96; p=0.57). Other outcomes, including MACCEs, myocardial infarction, stroke, total graft occlusion, revascularization, and saphenous vein occlusion, were comparable between groups.\n\nInterpretation: The meta-analysis supports the use of A+T post-CABG to reduce all-cause and cardiovascular mortality without increasing bleeding events compared to A+C. Further RCTs are needed to confirm these findings. Trial registration: PROSPERO CRD42022330721. Funding: Not specified.",
