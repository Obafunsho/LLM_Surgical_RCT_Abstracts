This multicentre randomised controlled trial assessed the prophylactic effect of transanal irrigation (TAI) in preventing LARS symptoms.\n\nMethods: Conducted at three institutions in Germany and Austria, patients who underwent ultralow rectal resection were randomised to TAI or control with supportive therapy post-ileostomy closure. Eligibility included anastomotic height <5 cm above the dentate line and confirmed anastomosis healing. The primary outcome was the maximum number of daytime defaecation episodes at 1 month. Randomisation was stratified by centre and anastomosis type, with allocation via an online minimization program. Blinding was not applied. Thirty-nine patients were randomised between February 2016 and April 2018; 18 to TAI and 19 to control. Thirty-seven were analysed per protocol.\n\nResults: At 1 month, TAI significantly reduced daytime defaecation episodes (median 3 vs. 7, p=0.003) and nighttime episodes (0 vs. 3, p=0.001). At 3 months, TAI continued to show fewer episodes (3 vs. 5 per day, p=0.006; 0 vs. 1 per night, p=0.002). LARS scores improved significantly in the TAI group at 1 month (median 16 vs. 32, p=0.044) and 3 months (9 vs. 31, p=0.001). Wexner scores were better at 3 months (2 vs. 6, p=0.046). No adverse events were reported.\n\nInterpretation: Prophylactic TAI significantly improved functional outcomes compared to supportive therapy for up to 3 months. The study suggests TAI as a viable prophylactic intervention for LARS. Trial registration: DRKS00011752. Funding: Not specified.",
