A 250-word version\n\nTitle: A Randomised Controlled Trial of a Holistic Approach to Atherosclerosis Management\n\nBackground: Atherosclerosis is a complex inflammatory disease affecting medium and large arteries, leading to ischemic heart disease, stroke, and peripheral arterial disease. Early detection and comprehensive management are crucial for reducing morbidity and mortality.\n\nMethods: This randomised controlled trial was conducted to evaluate a holistic approach to atherosclerosis management. Participants were adults with risk factors for atherosclerosis, recruited from multiple healthcare centers. They were randomly assigned to either a multidisciplinary team-led holistic care model or standard care. Randomisation was computer-generated, and allocation was concealed using sealed envelopes. Blinding was applied to outcome assessors.\n\nIntervention: The intervention group received comprehensive vascular assessments and multidisciplinary care, while the control group received standard care.\n\nObjective: To assess the effectiveness of a holistic approach in improving vascular health outcomes.\n\nOutcome: The primary outcome was the reduction in cardiovascular events over a 12-month period.\n\nResults: A total of 200 participants were randomised, with 100 in each group. Analysis was conducted on 98 participants in the intervention group and 97 in the control group using an intention-to-treat approach. The intervention group showed a significant reduction in cardiovascular events (mean difference = 5.2 events, 95% CI 3.1 to 7.3; p = 0.01). Adverse events were mild and occurred in 3% of the intervention group and 1% of the control group.\n\nTrial registration: NCT12345678.\n\nFunding: This trial was funded by the National Institutes of Health.",
