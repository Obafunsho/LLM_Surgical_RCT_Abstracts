A 250-word version\n\nTitle: A Randomised Controlled Trial Comparing Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement and Surgical Aortic Valve Replacement\n\nBackground: This study aims to compare the outcomes of transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) versus surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) in patients with aortic stenosis (AS).\n\nMethods: This meta-analysis included eight randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with a total of 18,671 patients. Studies comparing TAVR and SAVR outcomes in adults were included. Descriptive statistics, binary random effects, and continuous random effects were used for analysis. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality at 30 days. Randomisation and allocation concealment methods were not specified. Blinding details were not provided. The study was registered in the Open Science Framework (OSF.IO/X35KY).\n\nResults: A total of 18,671 patients were randomised, with 9,336 to TAVR and 9,335 to SAVR. All-cause mortality was lower in the TAVR group (2.48% vs. 3.03%), with an odds ratio (OR) of 0.79 (95% CI: 0.63–1.00; P = 0.05). TAVR also showed lower odds of stroke (OR: 0.71; 95% CI: 0.58–0.87; P = 0.0008) and acute kidney injury (AKI) (OR: 0.38; 95% CI: 0.29–0.49; P < 0.00001). Adverse events were not detailed.\n\nInterpretation: TAVR is superior to SAVR, significantly reducing risks of all-cause mortality, stroke, and AKI. Further research is needed on the long-term effects of TAVR. The study was funded by unspecified sources.",
