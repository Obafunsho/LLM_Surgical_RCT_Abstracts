A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial Comparing Cardiovascular Effects of Oxytocin and Carbetocin during Cesarean Section\n\nBackground: This randomised controlled trial aimed to evaluate the cardiovascular effects of oxytocin and carbetocin in pregnant women undergoing elective cesarean section, focusing on electrocardiographic changes.\n\nMethods: Seventy healthy pregnant women at term (37-41 weeks) were enrolled and randomly assigned to receive either 5 IU of intravenous oxytocin (OXY group, n=34) or 100 µg of intravenous carbetocin (CARBE group, n=36). Continuous Holter electrocardiograph recording was conducted from 30 minutes before the procedure until approximately 3 hours post-procedure. The primary outcome was the incidence of ST-segment changes, measured intraoperatively. Randomisation was based on the day of the month, and allocation was not concealed. Blinding was not implemented for patients or clinicians. The analysis was conducted on a per-protocol basis.\n\nResults: No significant differences were observed between the groups in terms of ST-segment depression, heart rate changes, or additional ventricular beats. The CARBE group showed no significant changes in mean arterial pressure during ST-segment depression. The effect size for ST-segment changes was not significant (p > 0.05). No adverse cardiovascular events were reported in either group, indicating the safety of both drugs in this setting.\n\nInterpretation: The study found no significant differences in cardiovascular effects between oxytocin and carbetocin during cesarean sections, suggesting both drugs are safe for use in this context. These findings support the use of either drug for uterine contraction without increased cardiovascular risk.\n\nTrial registration: Not provided.\n\nFunding: Not specified.",
