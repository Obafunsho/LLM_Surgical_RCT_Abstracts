Immunomodulation via checkpoint inhibition has shown promise in non-CNS cancers, but predicting responders in glioblastoma is challenging. OBJECTIVE: To assess the proportion of patients with increased interferon gamma levels in brain tumor tissue post-nivolumab and evaluate the safety of brain tumor microdialysis for immune response monitoring while assessing the safety of anti-PD-1 and anti-LAG-3 checkpoint inhibition. METHODS: This single-center, nonrandomized phase 1 trial enrolled up to 15 adult patients with recurrent glioblastoma, aiming for 10 completions over 18 months. Participants underwent biopsy, microdialysis catheter and lumbar drain placement, anti-PD-1 treatment, immune biomarker collection, tumor resection, and anti-PD-1 and anti-LAG-3 treatment until progression. RESULTS: Interferon gamma levels increased in treated patients as measured by microdialysis. Microdialysis was safe, and the combination of anti-LAG-3 and anti-PD-1 had a side effect profile similar to other checkpoint inhibitors. INTERPRETATION: This trial highlights the need for accurate response measurement in glioblastoma immune therapy. It may provide insights into patient response indicators.
