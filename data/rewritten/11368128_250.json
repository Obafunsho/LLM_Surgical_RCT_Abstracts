A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Impact of Mechanical Bowel Preparation on Gut Microbiome and Postoperative Infections: A Randomised Controlled Trial\n\nBackground: The role of mechanical bowel preparation (MBP) in colorectal cancer surgery and its impact on the gut microbiome and postoperative infections is not well understood. This study aimed to compare the effects of oral preparation (OP) and rectal enema (RE) on these outcomes.\n\nMethods: This open-label, two-arm pilot RCT was conducted at the National Cancer Institute, Vilnius, Lithuania. Patients with left-sided colorectal cancer scheduled for elective resection were randomized 1:1 to receive either OP or RE. The primary outcome was the difference in β-diversity of the gut microbiome on postoperative day (POD) 6. Randomization was computer-generated, and allocation was concealed using sealed opaque envelopes. Blinding was not possible due to the nature of the interventions.\n\nResults: Forty participants were randomized between April and November 2021, with 20 allocated to each group. Two patients in the OP group were excluded from analysis. No significant difference in β-diversity was observed on POD6 (p=0.198). Postoperative infections occurred in 12 patients (32%), with no significant difference between groups. Patients with infections showed increased abundance of specific bacteria on POD6.\n\nInterpretation: MBP with OP or RE resulted in similar dysbiosis and postoperative outcomes. The study highlights distinct microbiome changes in patients with infections. No adverse events related to MBP were reported. \n\nTrial registration: NCT04013841.\n\nFunding: Not specified.",
