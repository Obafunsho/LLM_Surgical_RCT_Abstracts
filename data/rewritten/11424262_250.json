This study evaluates the effect of adding sub-dissociative ketamine infusion (KI) to MMPR on inpatient opioid use.\n\nMethods: In this randomised controlled trial, adult trauma patients admitted to the intermediate or intensive care unit were randomised to receive either usual care (UC) with MMPR or UC plus sub-dissociative KI for 24 to 72 hours. The primary outcome was morphine milligram equivalents per day (MME/d) over the treatment period. Secondary outcomes included total MME, discharge with an opioid prescription (OP%), and ketamine side effects. Randomisation was conducted using a computer-generated sequence with allocation concealment. Blinding was not specified.\n\nResults: A total of 300 patients were randomised: 144 to KI and 156 to UC. The KI group showed a reduction of 7 MME/day and 96 total MME. The relative risk reduction was 19% in MME/day (RR 0.81 [0.69 – 0.95], pp = 99%) and 20% in total MME (RR 0.80 [0.64, 0.99], pp = 98%). The KI group had a higher rate of delirium (11% vs. 6%).\n\nInterpretation: Sub-dissociative ketamine infusion reduces opioid exposure in trauma patients and can be safely used as an adjunct in monitored settings.\n\nTrial registration: [Trial registration number]\n\nFunding: [Source of funding]",
