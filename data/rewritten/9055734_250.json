A 250-word version\n\nTitle: A Randomised Controlled Trial on the Risks of Peribulbar Anaesthesia\n\nBackground: Peribulbar anaesthesia for cataract surgery carries risks such as retrobulbar haemorrhage, globe perforation, and brainstem anaesthesia. This study aimed to assess the proximity of the medial canthus to the optic nerve and the safe angle between the orbit and globe using CT imaging.\n\nMethods: This single-centre retrospective study included 200 patients over 60 years old who underwent CT head studies for non-orbital indications between September and October 2020. Eligibility criteria excluded patients with known orbital or ocular diseases. The primary outcome was the distance from the medial canthus to the optic nerve, measured using multiplanar reconstructed CT images.\n\nResults: In 1.5% of the sample, the optic nerve was within 20 mm of the medial canthus, with a minimum distance of 15 mm. Additionally, 1% of patients had a safe angle of 10 degrees or less between bone and globe. No demographic data or axial length predicted these results. The study found a significant association between gender and the angle to the globe tangent, with males having a greater angle.\n\nInterpretation: A minority of patients have unusual orbital anatomy, placing them at higher theoretical risk for complications during peribulbar anaesthesia. Current pre-operative measurements do not predict these risks. Further research is needed to identify patients at increased risk.\n\nTrial registration: Not applicable.\n\nFunding: Not specified.",
