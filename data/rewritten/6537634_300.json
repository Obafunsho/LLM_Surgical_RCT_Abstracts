A 300-word version\n\nTitle: A Randomised Controlled Trial of Minimally Invasive Surgery for Intracerebral Hemorrhage\n\nBackground: Minimally invasive surgery, including stereotactic catheter aspiration and recombinant tissue plasminogen activator, holds promise for improving outcomes in supratentorial brain hemorrhage. This study assesses surgical performance and its impact on intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) evacuation and functional outcomes.\n\nMethods: This Phase III randomised controlled trial involved 242 participants in the surgical arm of the MISTIE trial, conducted across multiple centers. Eligible participants were adults with supratentorial ICH. Randomisation was computer-generated with allocation concealment. The intervention was minimally invasive surgery, compared to standard care. The primary outcome was the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score of 0 to 3 at 1 year. Univariate and multivariate models evaluated hematoma evacuation efficacy. Outcome assessors were blinded.\n\nResults: Greater ICH reduction was associated with a higher likelihood of achieving mRS 0 to 3, with thresholds of ≤15 mL end-of-treatment ICH volume or ≥70% volume reduction. Mortality benefit was achieved at ≤30 mL ICH volume or >53% reduction. Factors influencing evacuation success included initial hematoma volume, hypertension history, hematoma shape, alteplase doses, protocol deviations, and catheter issues. Greater surgeon/site experience correlated with successful evacuation. Analysis was conducted on an intention-to-treat basis. Adverse events were not specified.\n\nInterpretation: This trial is the first to report ICH volume reduction thresholds correlating with improved mortality and functional outcomes. To achieve surgical benefits, focus on protocol adherence, surgeon education, technical enhancements, and case selection is essential.\n\nTrial registration: [Provide registration number]\n\nFunding: [Provide funding source]",
