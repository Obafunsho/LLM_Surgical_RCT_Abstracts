A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Carotid Revascularization Endarterectomy versus Stenting Trial (CREST): A Randomised Controlled Trial\n\nBackground: The CREST trial compared periprocedural stroke and death (S+D) rates between carotid artery stenting (CAS) and carotid endarterectomy (CEA).\n\nMethods: This randomised controlled trial included 2,502 patients with carotid artery stenosis. Participants were randomised to either CAS or CEA. The primary outcome was the periprocedural S+D rate, assessed over a 30-day period. Randomisation was computer-generated, and allocation was concealed using sealed envelopes. Blinding was not applicable due to the nature of the interventions.\n\nResults: A total of 1,251 patients were randomised to each group. Analysis was conducted on an intention-to-treat basis. Lesion length and lesion characteristics were identified as effect modifiers. For lesions ≥12.85 mm, CAS had a higher S+D risk than CEA (OR = 3.42; 95% CI, 1.19-9.78). For sequential or remote lesions, CAS also had a higher risk (OR = 9.01; 95% CI: 1.20-67.8). In patients with short, contiguous lesions, CAS had a non-significantly lower S+D risk than CEA (OR = 0.72; 95% CI: 0.21-2.46).\n\nInterpretation: CAS is associated with a higher S+D risk in patients with longer or complex lesions. In the absence of these characteristics, CAS may be as safe as CEA.\n\nTrial registration: NCT00004732\n\nFunding: National Institutes of Health",
