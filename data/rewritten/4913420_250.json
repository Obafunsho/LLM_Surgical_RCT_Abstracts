A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Human Fibrinogen Concentrate in Aortic Surgery\n\nBackground: This randomised controlled trial evaluated the haemostatic efficacy of single-dose human fibrinogen concentrate (FCH) in patients undergoing elective aortic surgery requiring cardiopulmonary bypass.\n\nMethods: Patients were randomly assigned to receive FCH or placebo. Randomisation was computer-generated, and allocation was concealed using sealed envelopes. The study was conducted across 34 centres. Eligibility included patients with a 5 min bleeding mass of 60–250 g after separation from bypass and surgical haemostasis. The primary outcome was the number of allogeneic blood product units transfused within 24 hours post-surgery. Blinding was maintained for patients, clinicians, and outcome assessors.\n\nResults: A total of 519 patients were randomised, with 260 to FCH and 259 to placebo, between January 2010 and December 2012. Of these, 152 met the criteria for study medication. Median pretreatment 5 min bleeding mass was 107 g in the FCH group and 91 g in the placebo group. More blood products were transfused in the FCH group (median 5.0 units) compared to placebo (median 3.0 units), p = 0.026. Fewer patients avoided transfusion in the FCH group (15.4%) compared to placebo (28.4%), p = 0.047. Adverse events were similar between groups.\n\nInterpretation: Contrary to expectations, FCH was associated with increased transfusion requirements. The study suggests FCH may not be effective in this setting. Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01475669; EudraCT 2011-002685-20. Funding: Supported by [Funding Source].",
