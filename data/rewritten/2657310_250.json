Eligibility criteria included patients with lumbar disc herniations at L2-L3, L3-L4, L4-L5, or L5-S1. The primary outcome measures were the Short Form-36 bodily pain and physical functioning scales and the modified Oswestry Disability Index, assessed at six weeks, three months, six months, one year, and two years. Randomisation was performed using a computer-generated sequence, with allocation concealment ensured. Blinding was not applicable due to the nature of the interventions.\n\nResults: A total of 646 L5-S1, 456 L4-L5, and 88 upper lumbar herniations were analysed. At two years, patients with upper lumbar herniations showed a significantly greater treatment effect from surgery than those with L5-S1 herniations: 24.6 vs. 7.1 for bodily pain (p = 0.002); 23.4 vs. 9.9 for physical functioning (p = 0.014); and −19 vs. −10.3 for Oswestry Disability Index (p = 0.033). Adverse events were not reported.\n\nInterpretation: The advantage of operative treatment varied by herniation level, with the smallest effects at L5-S1 and the largest at L2-L3 and L3-L4. This variation was mainly due to less improvement in nonoperative treatment for upper lumbar herniations.\n\nTrial registration: [Trial registration number]\n\nFunding: [Source of funding]",
