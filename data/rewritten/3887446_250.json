A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Biventricular Pacing After Cardiac Surgery: A Randomised Controlled Trial\n\nBackground: This randomised controlled trial investigates the hemodynamic effects of temporary biventricular pacing in patients at risk of left ventricular dysfunction following cardiac surgery. The objective was to compare biventricular pacing with atrial pacing in terms of hemodynamic outcomes.\n\nMethods: Participants were patients undergoing cardiac surgery, eligible based on risk of left ventricular dysfunction. The study was conducted in a cardiac surgery unit. Patients were randomised to either continuous biventricular pacing (n = 16) or standard of care (n = 18). Randomisation was performed using a computer-generated sequence with allocation concealment. Blinding was not specified. The primary outcome was hemodynamic improvement, measured by cardiac output and vasoactive-inotropic score, over the first 24 hours post-bypass.\n\nResults: A total of 34 patients were randomised and analysed. At 12 to 24 hours post-bypass, intrinsic heart rate was lower in the paced group (76.5 ± 17.5 vs 91.7 ± 13.0 beats per minute; P = .040). Cardiac output increased in the paced group (4.4 ± 1.2 vs 3.6 ± 1.9 L/min; P = .054). No significant differences in vasoactive medication doses were observed, but dexmedetomidine administration was prolonged in the paced group (793 ± 528 vs 478 ± 295 minutes; P = .013). No adverse events were reported.\n\nInterpretation: Biventricular pacing post-cardiac surgery improves hemodynamics and reduces intrinsic heart rate, suggesting a withdrawal of sympathetic drive. Further studies are needed to assess clinical benefits. Trial registration and funding details were not provided.",
