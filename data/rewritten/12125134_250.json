A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Tranexamic Acid Dosing in Chinese Cardiac Surgery Patients\n\nBackground: This randomised controlled trial aimed to establish a population pharmacokinetic (PK) model of tranexamic acid (TXA) in Chinese patients undergoing cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) to guide individualized dosing strategies.\n\nMethods: Conducted at Fuwai Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, participants aged 18-70 years undergoing cardiac surgery with CPB were randomly assigned to high-dose (30 mg/kg bolus, 16 mg/kg/h maintenance, 2 mg/kg prime, n=7) or low-dose (10 mg/kg bolus, 2 mg/kg/h maintenance, 1 mg/kg prime, n=9) TXA groups. Randomisation was performed using a computer-generated sequence with allocation concealment by a blinded research coordinator. Blood samples were collected at 14 time points, and TXA concentrations were measured using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry.\n\nResults: Body weight was identified as the primary covariate affecting PK parameters. No significant influence of CPB on PK was detected. Population estimates for clearance (CL1), volume of the central compartment (V1), diffusional clearance (CL2), and volume of peripheral compartment (V2) were 4.7 L/h, 4.9 L, 17.0 L/h, and 11.1 L, respectively. No adverse events were reported.\n\nInterpretation: This study provides the first population PK model of TXA in the Chinese population, suggesting target-controlled infusion as a viable option for individualized dosing. Trial registration: N/A. Funding: Not specified.",
