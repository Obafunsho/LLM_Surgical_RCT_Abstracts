This study assesses its effectiveness as a primary treatment option.\n\nMethods: Conducted at S.M.S. Medical College and Group of Hospitals, Jaipur, this retrospective analysis included 90 patients with severe aortoiliac occlusive disease from August 2012 to August 2022. Eligibility criteria were complete abdominal aorta obstruction at the renal artery level with no suitable site for aorta clamping. The intervention involved thoracobifemoral bypass using BARD IMPRA expanded polytetrafluoroethylene vascular grafts. The primary outcome was 30-day graft patency. No randomisation or blinding was employed.\n\nResults: Among the 90 patients (83 males, 7 females; ages 51-77), the 30-day mortality rate was 3.33% (3 patients). Graft patency was 100% at 30 days. Major morbidities included graft occlusion in one patient, managed by embolectomy, and ascites in another, addressed conservatively. The study did not employ randomisation or blinding, and the analysis was conducted on all 90 patients.\n\nInterpretation: Thoracofemoral bypass as a primary intervention for juxtarenal aortoiliac occlusive disease shows favorable short-term outcomes with reliable patency and acceptable safety. The absence of randomisation and blinding limits the study's generalizability. The study was not registered as a trial and was funded by institutional resources. Further research with a randomised controlled design is recommended to validate these findings.",
