A 250-word version\n\nTitle: A Randomised Controlled Trial Comparing Kinematic and Mechanical Alignment in Total Knee Arthroplasty\n\nBackground: This randomised controlled trial aimed to compare kinematic alignment (KA) and mechanical alignment (MA) techniques in total knee arthroplasty (TKA) regarding patient-reported outcomes and component alignment.\n\nMethods: Ninety-nine primary TKAs in 95 patients were randomised to either the KA group (n = 49) or the MA group (n = 50). Eligibility criteria included patients undergoing primary TKA. The study was conducted at a single institution. In the KA group, patient-specific cutting blocks were manufactured using preoperative MRI data, while the MA group used computer navigation for neutral alignment. The primary outcome was the Oxford Knee Score (OKS) measured preoperatively and at 6 weeks, 6 months, 1 year, and 2 years postoperatively. Randomisation was computer-generated, and allocation was concealed. Blinding was not specified. Sample size was calculated for 80% power to detect a 5-point OKS difference.\n\nResults: No significant difference was found in 2-year OKS change scores between KA and MA groups (mean difference 1.0, 95% CI, −1.4 to 3.4, p = 0.4). Postoperative component alignment differed, with the KA group showing more varus tibial and valgus femoral components. Complication rates were similar between groups.\n\nInterpretation: The study found no advantage in 2-year patient-reported outcomes for KA over MA in TKA. The alignment differences observed in KA did not translate into improved pain or function. Long-term effects on TKA survivorship remain uncertain.\n\nTrial registration: Not provided.
