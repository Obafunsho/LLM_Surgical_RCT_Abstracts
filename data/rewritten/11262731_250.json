A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Bleselumab for Prevention of Recurrent Focal Segmental Glomerulosclerosis\n\nBackground: Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) often recurs after kidney transplantation, leading to poor outcomes. This study evaluates bleselumab, an anti-CD40 monoclonal antibody, for preventing recurrent FSGS (rFSGS).\n\nMethods: In this phase 2a, randomised, open-label trial, adult kidney transplant recipients with biopsy-proven primary FSGS were enrolled at 23 sites in Canada and the United States from May 2017 to May 2021. Participants were randomised 1:1 to receive bleselumab with tacrolimus and corticosteroids or standard of care (SOC) with tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil, and corticosteroids. All received basiliximab induction. The primary outcome was rFSGS, defined as proteinuria (protein-creatinine ratio ≥3.0 g/g) with death, graft loss, or loss to follow-up imputed as rFSGS, measured through 3 months posttransplant. Randomisation was stratified by previous transplant status, and outcome assessors were blinded.\n\nResults: Sixty-three patients were analysed (bleselumab: 29, SOC: 34). Bleselumab showed a 40.7% relative decrease in rFSGS occurrence versus SOC (95% CI, −89.8 to 26.8; P = 0.37). Central-blinded biopsy review showed non-significant relative decreases in rFSGS of 10.9% at 3 months. Adverse events were similar between groups, with no deaths reported.\n\nInterpretation: Bleselumab reduced proteinuria occurrence compared to SOC but did not significantly affect biopsy-proven rFSGS. Further studies are needed to confirm these findings.\n\nTrial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02921789.\n\nFunding: The study was funded by the sponsor.",
