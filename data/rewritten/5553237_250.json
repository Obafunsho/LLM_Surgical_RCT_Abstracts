Eligible participants were aged 20-75 years with T1N0 or T2N0 low rectal cancer, confirmed by MRI, CT, proctoscopy, and digital rectal examination. The intervention involved LE followed by CRT (45 Gy external beam irradiation and 5-week intravenous 5-fluorouracil). The primary outcome was 5-year disease-free survival (DFS). The study was registered (No. 000011417).\n\nResults: Fifty-seven patients were treated, with 53 having T1 lesions and 4 having T2 lesions. The completion rate for full-dose CRT was 86%. The 5-year DFS was 94% for T1 lesions and 75% for T2 lesions. Two local recurrences were observed. No serious, nontransient treatment-related complications were reported.\n\nInterpretation: CRT combined with LE for T1 rectal adenocarcinomas with poor prognostic features improved oncologic outcomes without major adverse effects. The study was limited by the small number of T2 cases and retrospective quality of life evaluations.\n\nTrial registration: No. 000011417\n\nFunding: Not specified.",
