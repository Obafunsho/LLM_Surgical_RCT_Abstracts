They were randomised to SAP or TAP using an automated service, with allocation concealment. Blinding was not feasible for patients or clinicians. The primary outcome was the VEINES-QOL/Sym score at 12 months. Secondary outcomes included cost-effectiveness and anatomical success.\n\nResults: Between January 2015 and December 2018, 464 patients were randomised (SAP 227, TAP 237). Analysis was intention-to-treat. VEINES-QOL scores were 52.7 (95% CI 51.9 to 53.9) for SAP and 53.8 (53.3 to 55.1) for TAP. Fifty-eight patients (25.6%) in the SAP group required additional truncal ablation. SAP was less costly than TAP. Adverse events were minor and similar between groups.\n\nInterpretation: SAP was non-inferior to TAP in terms of health-related quality of life at 12 months and was a cost-effective alternative.
