A 300-word version\n\nBackground: This study aimed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of preoperative glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RA) in elective surgical systems, addressing the need for scalable weight management strategies.\n\nMethods: A systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted, searching PubMed, MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane Library up to March 31, 2025, for studies on preoperative GLP-1 RA use in adults undergoing elective surgery. The primary outcome was perioperative safety, defined as any complication within 90 days post-surgery. Secondary outcomes included preoperative weight loss. Both frequentist and Bayesian random-effects meta-analyses were performed. A Bayesian hierarchical meta-regression explored effect modifiers. The study is registered with PROSPERO, CRD420251027809.\n\nResults: A total of 21 studies, involving 97,059 patients, met inclusion criteria; 31.9% (n = 30,981) received preoperative GLP-1 RA therapy. Most studies were single-centre observational cohorts from high-income countries, with no randomised trials identified. Postoperative complications were reported in 12 studies, with no increased risk in GLP-1 users (pooled OR: 0.78, 95% CI: 0.59–1.05). High heterogeneity was observed (I² = 73%). Bayesian analysis yielded consistent findings (posterior mean OR: 0.78; 95% credible interval: 0.57–1.12). Meta-regression identified no statistically significant modifiers of treatment effect. The overall GRADE assessment for certainty of evidence was very low. Preoperative GLP-1 RA use was associated with weight loss of up to 16.7 kg or 6.0 kg/m² over six months.\n\nInterpretation: Preoperative GLP-1 RA therapy may support clinically meaningful weight loss without increased perioperative risk, offering a potentially scalable strategy for surgical optimisation. However, the certainty of current evidence is very low, with most studies observational in design and at risk of bias. Robust randomised trials are needed to establish their clinical value and implementation potential.\n\nFunding: NIHR Doctoral Research Fellowship and NIHR Exeter Biomedical Research Centre Senior Investigator Fellowship.",
