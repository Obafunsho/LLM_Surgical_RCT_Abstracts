A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial on Postoperative Sore Throat Prevention\n\nBackground: Postoperative sore throat (POST) is a common complication after tracheal intubation. This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of various interventions in preventing POST.\n\nMethods: This randomised controlled trial was conducted in a hospital setting. Participants were adults undergoing elective surgery requiring tracheal intubation. They were randomly assigned to receive either pharmacological interventions (NSAIDs or steroids), non-pharmacological interventions, or traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) therapy. The primary outcome was the incidence of POST within 24 hours post-surgery. Randomisation was computer-generated, and allocation was concealed using sealed envelopes. Blinding was applied to outcome assessors.\n\nResults: A total of 200 participants were randomised: 100 to the intervention group and 100 to the control group. The analysis included 98 participants in the intervention group and 97 in the control group, using an intention-to-treat approach. The intervention group showed a significant reduction in POST incidence compared to the control group (mean difference = 15%, 95% CI 10% to 20%; p < 0.01). Adverse events were mild, with 3% in the intervention group and 1% in the control group experiencing minor side effects.\n\nInterpretation: The study demonstrates that pharmacological, non-pharmacological, and TCM interventions effectively reduce POST incidence. Integrating these strategies into clinical practice could enhance patient recovery. Trial registration: NCT12345678. Funding: Supported by hospital intramural sources.",
