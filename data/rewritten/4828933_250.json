A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Intraoperative Molecular Imaging with a Targeted Contrast Agent for Lung Adenocarcinomas\n\nBackground: Over 80,000 people undergo resection of a pulmonary tumor each year, with malignancy determined by histological analysis. This study evaluates a targeted molecular contrast agent for identifying lung adenocarcinomas via real-time optical imaging during surgery.\n\nMethods: In this randomised controlled trial, 50 patients with biopsy-proven lung adenocarcinoma were enrolled at a single surgical center. Patients were systemically administered 0.1 mg/kg of a fluorescent folate receptor alpha (FRα)-targeted molecular contrast agent intravenously before surgery. Tumors were imaged in situ and ex vivo. The primary outcome was the identification of fluorescent tumors, measured intraoperatively.\n\nResults: Of the 50 patients, 46 (92%) had fluorescent tumors. No false uptake was observed. Intraoperative imaging identified metastases in 2 cases. Four adenocarcinomas were non-fluorescent, correlating with lack of FRα expression. Tumor fluorescence was independent of size, 18 FDG uptake, histology, and differentiation. Only 7 adenocarcinomas were identified in situ without bisection. The distance from the pleural surface was a key predictor of in situ identification.\n\nInterpretation: Intraoperative molecular imaging with a targeted contrast agent effectively identifies lung adenocarcinomas, particularly subpleural tumors. Further refinements may enhance detection of deeper tumors. No adverse events were reported. Trial registration: [Trial registration number]. Funding: [Source of funding].",
