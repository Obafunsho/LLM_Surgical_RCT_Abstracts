This study investigates the association between EtCO2 levels and recurrence-free survival in pancreatic cancer surgery.\n\nMethods: This single-center, retrospective cohort study analyzed 652 patients undergoing elective pancreatic cancer resection at Heidelberg University Hospital from 2009 to 2016. Patients were divided into high-EtCO2 and low-EtCO2 groups based on mean intraoperative EtCO2 values. The primary outcome was recurrence-free survival, with secondary outcomes including cardiovascular events, surgical site infections, sepsis, reoperations, and overall survival.\n\nResults: Mean EtCO2 was 33.8 mmHg ±1.1 in the low-EtCO2 group and 36.8 mmHg ±1.9 in the high-EtCO2 group. Median follow-up was 2.6 years. Recurrence-free survival did not differ between groups [HR = 1.043 (95% CI: 0.875–1.243), p = 0.909]. Cox analysis showed no correlation between EtCO2 levels and recurrence-free survival [Coefficient −0.004, HR = 0.996 (95% CI: 0.95–1.04); p = 0.871]. No differences were found in secondary outcomes.\n\nInterpretation: Intraoperative EtCO2 levels during pancreatic cancer surgery were not associated with recurrence-free survival or secondary outcomes. Anesthesiologists should set EtCO2 targets based on factors other than oncological outcomes until further evidence from prospective trials is available.\n\nTrial registration: Not applicable.\n\nFunding: Not specified.",
