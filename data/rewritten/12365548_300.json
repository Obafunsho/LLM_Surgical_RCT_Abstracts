Participants were patients undergoing CABG, with eligibility criteria including suitability for SV grafting. The study was conducted at multiple centers. Randomisation was performed using a computer-generated sequence, and allocation was concealed using sealed envelopes. Blinding was applied to outcome assessors.\n\nIntervention: The intervention group received NT SV grafts, while the control group received conventionally harvested SV grafts.\n\nObjective: To evaluate the effectiveness of NT SV grafts in improving graft patency.\n\nOutcome: The primary outcome was graft patency, assessed at 12 months postoperatively.\n\nResults: A total of 2655 patients were randomised, with 1328 in the NT group and 1327 in the control group. Analysis was conducted on 1300 NT and 1295 control patients using an intention-to-treat approach. The NT group showed a significantly lower occlusion rate (3.7%) compared to the control group (6.5%), with an odds ratio of 0.56 (95% CI, 0.41–0.76; P <0.001). Leg wound complications were reported in 1.3% of NT patients.\n\nInterpretation: The NT SV graft technique significantly improves graft patency and reduces occlusion rates compared to conventional methods. The study supports the use of NT SV grafts in CABG to enhance long-term outcomes. Trial registration: N/A. Funding: Not specified.",
