The primary endpoint was overall survival (OS). Randomization was conducted using an interactive web response system with permuted blocks, stratified by ECOG performance status and resectability. The trial was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02172976).\n\nResults: Recruitment was prematurely stopped after 40 patients were randomized (arm A: 21, arm B: 19) due to poor accrual. In the intention-to-treat population, median OS was 25.68 months (95% CI 11.74, –) in arm A and 10.03 months (95% CI 6.25–27.95) in arm B. Median RFS/PFS was 9.8 months (95% CI 4.44–19.76) in arm A and 6.64 months (95% CI 2.50–11.84) in arm B. Perioperative morbidity was 72% in arm A and 46% in arm B. Adverse events grade ≥3 were higher in arm B (84% vs. 57%). \n\nInterpretation: Although limited by small sample size, perioperative FOLFIRINOX showed no increased surgical complications but did not improve OS compared to adjuvant gemcitabine. Patient selection for neoadjuvant therapy is critical. The trial was funded by institutional sources. The trial registration number is NCT02172976.",
