Subpleural tumor implantation was performed on day 0 with 1 million IL45-luciferase cells. Tumors were resected on day 9, followed by treatment with cis-fib or NaCl-fib. On day 12, computed tomography-guided local irradiation was applied. Randomization was performed using a computer-generated sequence, and outcome assessors were blinded.\n\nResults: Short-term side effects were observed with 20 Gy IR. At day 15, tumors in the cis-fib+20 Gy IR group were significantly smaller than those in the IR alone group (mean tumor growth, 252% vs 539%; P=0.04). By day 21, cis-fib+20 Gy IR showed a significant tumor growth delay compared to cis-fib alone (mean tumor growth, 2295% vs 660%; P=0.01).\n\nInterpretation: Combining cis-fib with 20 Gy IR is safe and shows an additive effect on tumor growth delay in this rat model. No significant difference in overall survival was observed. Trial registration: ZH095/2016. Funding: Not specified.",
