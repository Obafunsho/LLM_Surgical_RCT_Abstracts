The primary outcome was the rate of low parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels on the first postoperative day. Randomisation was performed using the Eurocrine® platform with allocation concealed from patients. The study was single-blinded.\n\nResults: Between January 2021 and August 2022, 535 patients were randomised, and 486 were analysed (246 intervention, 240 control). The rate of low PTH levels was 26.0% in the intervention group and 32.1% in the control group (RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.61 to 1.07; p = 0.141). In a subgroup undergoing central lymph node dissection, the rates were 18.3% and 33.7%, respectively (RR 0.54, 95% CI 0.31 to 0.93; p = 0.021). No specific harm related to Fluobeam® LX was reported.\n\nInterpretation: Autofluorescence did not significantly reduce low PTH rates in the overall cohort but was beneficial in a subgroup.
