A 300-word version\n\nBackground: This study aimed to characterize the inflammatory and coagulopathic response after endovascular thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm (TAAA) repair and evaluate its effect on post-operative renal function.\n\nMethods: A single-center, prospective cohort study was conducted from July 2005 to June 2008. Forty-two patients undergoing elective endovascular TAAA repair with custom-designed multi-branched stent-grafts were enrolled. Four patients were excluded, leaving 38 for analysis. White blood cell count (WBC), platelet count, prothrombin time (PT), and creatinine were measured in all patients. In the last 9 patients, interleukin-6 (IL-6), protein C, Factor V, d-dimers, cystatin C, and neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) levels were also measured. Changes in lab values were expressed as a percentage of baseline values.\n\nResults: The 30-day mortality rate was 5% (2/38). All patients had increased WBC (139 ± 80%, P<0.0001), decreased platelet count (56 ± 15%, P<0.0001), and increased PT (median: 17%, IQR 12 - 22%, P<0.0001) post-procedure. Twelve patients (32%) developed acute renal insufficiency (>50% rise in creatinine). Patients with renal insufficiency had larger changes in WBC (178 ± 100% vs 121 ± 64%, p=0.04) and platelet count (64 ± 17% vs 52 ± 12%, p=0.02). All patients (n=9) had increased NGAL (182 ± 115%, p=0.008). Six of nine patients (67%) had increased cystatin C (35 ± 43%, p = 0.04), with a greater rise in those with renal insufficiency (87 ± 32% vs 8 ± 13%, p = 0.02). IL-6 levels increased significantly (9,840 ± 6,160%, p=0.008). Protein C and Factor V levels decreased, while d-dimers increased.\n\nInterpretation: Leukocytosis and thrombocytopenia were consistent post-endovascular TAAA repair, correlating with renal dysfunction. Elevated NGAL suggests renal injury may occur in all patients post-stent-graft insertion.",
