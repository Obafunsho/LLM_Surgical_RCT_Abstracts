A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Carotid Occlusion Surgery Study: A Randomised Controlled Trial\n\nBackground: The Carotid Occlusion Surgery Study (COSS) was conducted to determine if STA-MCA bypass, when added to best medical therapy, would reduce subsequent ipsilateral stroke in patients with complete ICA occlusion and elevated OEF.\n\nMethods: COSS was a parallel group, prospective, 1:1 randomised, open-label, blinded-adjudication trial. Participants with angiographic confirmed complete ICA occlusion causing TIA or ischemic stroke within 120 days and hemodynamic cerebral ischemia (elevated OEF by PET) were randomised to surgical or medical treatment. The surgical group underwent STA-MCA cortical branch anastomosis. Randomisation was conducted centrally, and outcome assessors were blinded. A total of 195 patients were randomised: 97 to surgery and 98 to medical therapy. The primary outcome was the rate of ipsilateral stroke over two years.\n\nResults: In the intention-to-treat analysis, the two-year primary endpoint rates were 21.0% for the surgical group and 22.7% for the medical group (p=0.78). Fourteen (15%) of 93 surgical patients experienced an ipsilateral hemispheric stroke within 30 days post-operation, with 12 occurring within two days. The STA-MCA bypass patency rate was 98% at 30 days and 96% at last follow-up. Five surgical patients and one non-operated patient had an ipsilateral stroke after 30 days. No baseline characteristics or intra-operative variables predicted procedure-related strokes.\n\nInterpretation: Despite excellent graft patency and improved cerebral hemodynamics, STA-MCA anastomosis did not significantly reduce two-year ipsilateral stroke recurrence, due to a lower than expected stroke rate in the medical group and a significant peri-operative stroke rate.\n\nTrial registration: [Trial registration number]\n\nFunding: [Source of funding]",
