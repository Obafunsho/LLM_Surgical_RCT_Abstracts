A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Tranexamic Acid Administration Routes in Total Knee Arthroplasty\n\nBackground: This randomised controlled trial evaluated the efficacy of different tranexamic acid administration routes in reducing total blood loss and allogeneic transfusion rates in total knee arthroplasty (TKA).\n\nMethods: Between March 2014 and March 2015, 376 patients undergoing TKA were randomised into four groups: IV only, IA only, low-dose combined (IV + IA injection of 1 g), and high-dose combined (IV + IA injection of 2 g). Randomisation was conducted using a computer-generated sequence with allocation concealment. The primary outcome was total blood loss, calculated using estimated total body blood volume and hemoglobin loss. Secondary outcomes included allogeneic transfusion rate, symptomatic venous thromboembolism (VTE), and wound complications. Outcome assessors were blinded to group allocation.\n\nResults: The high- and low-dose combined groups and the IA-only group demonstrated significantly lower total blood loss compared to the IV-only group (mean differences = 199 mL [95% CI, 116–283 mL], p < 0.001; 121 mL [95% CI, 38–205 mL], p = 0.001; 131 mL [95% CI, 47–214 mL], p < 0.001). No patients required allogeneic transfusions. One patient in the IV-only group developed a symptomatic pulmonary embolism, while no other symptomatic VTE events occurred. Wound complications, including superficial wound necrosis and oozing, were similar across groups.\n\nInterpretation: IA tranexamic acid administration is more effective in reducing blood loss than IV use alone in TKA, with no additional benefit from combined administration. Further research is needed to confirm the safety of IA administration as the preferred route. Trial registration: [Trial registration number]. Funding: [Source of funding].",
