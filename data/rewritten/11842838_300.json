This study aimed to investigate the relationship between RBC transfusion volume and mortality in burn patients.\n\nMethods: This retrospective cohort study included 379 patients with over 50% total body surface area burns admitted to three burn centers in China from January 2016 to June 2022. Patients were categorized into high and low RBC transfusion groups based on a 6-unit threshold. Propensity score matching was employed to adjust for differences in burn area, full thickness burned area, and inhalation injury. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality, with secondary outcomes including burn ICU and hospital length of stay, mechanical ventilation time, and incidence of bloodstream infections.\n\nResults: The relationship between RBC transfusion volume and mortality was L-shaped, with a marked increase in risk at low transfusion volumes (p < 0.0001). After propensity matching, no significant difference in mortality or bloodstream infection was observed between the groups. However, the low RBC transfusion group experienced significantly shorter hospital stays, burn ICU stays, and mechanical ventilation times compared to the high RBC transfusion group (p < 0.001).\n\nInterpretation: The results support a restrictive transfusion strategy in severely burned patients, as unnecessary RBC transfusions do not enhance outcomes and may extend hospital stays. This study underscores the importance of cautious use of blood products in burn care to optimize patient outcomes. The findings align with existing guidelines advocating for restrictive transfusion practices and suggest that avoiding excessive RBC transfusions is beneficial in clinical settings.",
