A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial on Labor Epidural Conversion Failure for Caesarean Delivery\n\nBackground: This study aimed to evaluate the incidence and risk factors of labor epidural conversion failure requiring general anesthesia for Caesarean delivery (CD).\n\nMethods: A retrospective chart review was conducted at Penn State Health Milton S. Hershey Medical Center, including pregnant patients from November 2009 to September 2014 who required CD with a pre-existing labor epidural. The primary outcome was the rate of epidural conversion failure, defined as the need for general anesthesia prior to or during CD. Logistic regression was used to identify risk factors. \n\nResults: A total of 673 patients were included, with a 21% failure rate of epidural conversion. Significant risk factors included younger maternal age (OR 0.94, 95% CI 0.90 to 0.97, P = 0.0002), and the use of intravenous fentanyl (OR 0.19, 95% CI 0.10 to 0.35, P < 0.0001) or midazolam (OR 0.26, 95% CI 0.12 to 0.57, P = 0.0008) during CD. Higher urgency of CD (categories 1, 2, and 3 vs. category 4) was also associated with increased failure rates. The study did not employ randomisation or blinding, as it was a retrospective analysis.\n\nInterpretation: The study confirms that younger age and higher urgency of CD are significant risk factors for epidural conversion failure. These findings suggest that inadequate labor epidurals may contribute to conversion failure. Further prospective studies are needed to explore these factors. No adverse events were reported. The study was not registered as a trial and received no external funding. The results highlight the importance of diligent diagnosis and evaluation of labor epidurals to prevent conversion failure.",
