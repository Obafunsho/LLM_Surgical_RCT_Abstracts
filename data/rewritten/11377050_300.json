The primary outcome was the duration of analgesia, measured from the block's performance to the first analgesic request. Nine trials with 546 patients were included. Randomisation and allocation concealment methods varied across trials. Blinding of outcome assessors, patients, and clinicians was inconsistently reported. The trials were conducted in various settings, focusing on femoral, sciatic, and ankle blocks with long-acting local anaesthetics.\n\nResults: Perineural dexamethasone increased the duration of analgesia from 19.54 to 22.27 hours, with a mean difference of 2.73 hours (95% CI 1.07 to 4.38; p = 0.001; I² = 87). No significant differences were found in secondary outcomes related to efficacy and side effects. Adverse events were not consistently reported, and the quality of evidence was moderate due to serious inconsistency. The analysis based on the location of the peripheral nerve block, the type of local anaesthetic, or the use of perineural adrenaline showed no difference in duration between intravenous and perineural dexamethasone.\n\nInterpretation: Perineural dexamethasone is superior to intravenous dexamethasone in prolonging analgesia duration, but the clinical relevance is questionable. The perineural route remains off-label. Trial registration: PROSPERO CRD 42023442453. Funding sources were not specified. Further trials with consistent methodologies are needed to confirm these findings and assess the clinical significance of the observed differences.",
