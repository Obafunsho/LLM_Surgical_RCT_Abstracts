This study evaluated the safety and neurological recovery benefits of Neuro-Spinal Scaffold (NSS) implantation in thoracic complete SCI compared to standard-of-care (SOC) spine surgery.\n\nMethods: INSPIRE 2.0 was a randomised, controlled, parallel-group, multicenter trial conducted at Level I trauma centers in the United States (ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03762655). Eligible patients aged 16-70 with AIS grade A, thoracic (T2-T12), nonpenetrating SCI requiring spine surgery ≤7 days post-injury were randomised (1:1) to NSS implantation or SOC surgery alone. Randomisation used a computer-generated allocation sequence with permuted blocks, and allocation was concealed. Patients and outcome assessors were blinded. The primary outcome was the proportion of patients with ≥1 AIS grade improvement at 6 months.\n\nResults: Twenty patients were randomised (10 per group) between May 2019 and June 2022. At 6 months, 20% of NSS patients and 30% of control patients showed AIS grade improvement. No serious or unanticipated adverse device effects were reported. The study was closed due to not meeting the primary endpoint.\n\nInterpretation: NSS implantation did not demonstrate a probable clinical benefit in this small cohort. However, the procedure was safe, supporting the feasibility of surgical intervention in injured spinal cord parenchyma.\n\nTrial registration: NCT03762655\n\nFunding: InVivo Therapeutics Corporation",
