A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Dexamethasone as an Analgesic Adjuvant in Minimally Invasive Thoracic Surgery\n\nBackground: This study evaluates the efficacy of dexamethasone as an analgesic adjuvant in minimally invasive thoracic surgery. \n\nMethods: A retrospective cohort study was conducted at the University Hospital of Trieste, Italy, from January 10, 2017, to November 6, 2019. Participants were adults undergoing elective lobectomy, segmentectomy, or wedge resection with mini-thoracotomy or VATS. Patients were divided into two groups: 46 received dexamethasone 8 mg at induction, and 24 received ondansetron 4 mg before extubation. The primary outcome was morphine consumption 24 hours post-surgery. Secondary outcomes included pain control (NRS), glycemic changes, PONV, and surgical wound infection. \n\nResults: No significant difference in morphine consumption at 24 hours was observed between groups (p = 0.09). However, patients not receiving dexamethasone required more rescue therapy (p = 0.01) and had a tendency for higher attempted-PCA pushes. No surgical wound infections were detected, and PONV incidence was similar. Postoperative glycemia was transiently higher in the dexamethasone group (p = 0.004), but hypoglycemic therapy needs were not significantly different. \n\nInterpretation: Preoperative dexamethasone did not significantly reduce morphine consumption but was safe and beneficial in a multimodal anesthesia approach.
