The primary outcome was postoperative complications, with secondary outcomes including 3-year cumulative incidence of disease recurrence and 5-year overall survival. Randomisation was computer-generated, and allocation was concealed. Blinding included patients, clinicians, and outcome assessors.\n\nResults: Of 148 randomised patients, 125 were analysed (65 n-3 FA, 60 control) using an intention-to-treat approach. No significant difference in postoperative complications was observed (P = 0.544). The 3-year disease recurrence risk was similar between groups (RR 1.66, 95% CI 0.65 to 4.26). The 5-year survival rate was 69.2% (95% CI 56.5 to 78.9) for the n-3 FA group and 81.7% (95% CI 69.3 to 89.4) for the control group (P = 0.193). Adjusted analysis for age, disease stage, and adjuvant chemotherapy indicated higher mortality with n-3 FA (HR 1.73, 95% CI 1.06 to 2.83; P = 0.029). No significant interaction with adjuvant chemotherapy was found. Adverse events were not reported.\n\nInterpretation: Perioperative n-3 FA supplementation did not confer a survival benefit or reduce disease recurrence in colorectal cancer surgery patients.
