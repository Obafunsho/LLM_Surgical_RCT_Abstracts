A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Minimally Invasive Tissue-Selective Therapy Stapler (TST) for Severe Hemorrhoids\n\nBackground: Severe hemorrhoids significantly impact quality of life. This study evaluates the efficacy and safety of minimally invasive TST surgery compared to PPH and EPH techniques.\n\nMethods: This randomised controlled trial was conducted at our hospital from March 2015 to February 2018. A total of 141 patients with severe hemorrhoids were randomised into three groups: TST (n=47), PPH (n=47), and EPH (n=47). Eligibility criteria included ages 18-80, grades III-IV hemorrhoids, and no prior hemorrhoid surgery. The primary outcome was clinical efficacy, measured by symptom resolution at 3 months. Secondary outcomes included hospital stay, operation time, intraoperative blood loss, and anal dynamics. Randomisation was performed using block randomisation with a block size of 6, and allocation was concealed until surgery. Outcome assessors were blinded.\n\nResults: The TST group showed a higher total effective rate (93.62%) compared to PPH (74.47%) and EPH (72.34%). TST resulted in shorter hospital stays, operation times, and less blood loss. Anal dynamics improved significantly in the TST group. The complication rate was lower in the TST group (10.64%) compared to PPH (27.66%) and EPH (31.91%).\n\nInterpretation: TST is an effective and safe treatment for severe hemorrhoids, offering improved clinical outcomes and reduced complications.
