A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Perioperative Outcomes of Neoadjuvant Nivolumab or Nivolumab Plus Ipilimumab in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer: A Randomised Controlled Trial\n\nBackground: This randomised controlled trial aimed to assess the perioperative outcomes of neoadjuvant nivolumab (N) or nivolumab plus ipilimumab (NI) in patients with stage I-IIIA non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).\n\nMethods: Forty-four patients with stage I-IIIA NSCLC were randomised to receive either N (3 mg/kg intravenously on days 1, 15, and 29; n = 23) or NI (N plus ipilimumab 1 mg/kg intravenously on day 1; n = 21). Curative-intent operations were planned 3-6 weeks post-treatment. The primary outcome was the rate of R0 resection, measured at the time of surgery. Randomisation was computer-generated, and allocation was concealed. Blinding was not applied.\n\nResults: In the N arm, 21 (91%) underwent on-trial resection, 1 off-trial, and 1 was not resected due to toxicity. In the NI arm, 16 (76%) underwent on-trial resection, 1 off-trial, and 4 were not resected. All 37 resected patients achieved R0 resection. Complications included pulmonary (24%), cardiac (11%), enteric (5%), neurologic (3%), and wound (3%). The 30-day mortality was 0%, and 90-day mortality was 2.7%. Postoperative complication rates were comparable to those after chemotherapy or upfront resection.\n\nInterpretation: Neoadjuvant N or NI is safe and effective, with perioperative outcomes similar to chemotherapy or upfront resection.
