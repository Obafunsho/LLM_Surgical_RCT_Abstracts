A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Enhanced Preoxygenation Protocol in Gastroscopy: A Randomised Controlled Trial\n\nBackground: Hypoxemia during propofol sedation for gastrointestinal endoscopy is a significant risk, particularly in high-risk patients. This study evaluated the efficacy of an enhanced preoxygenation protocol in reducing hypoxemia incidence.\n\nMethods: This single-center, nonblinded, randomised controlled trial was conducted at Shanghai Changhai Hospital. Eligible participants were adults aged 18–75 years, scheduled for elective, diagnostic, and sedated gastroscopy. Participants were randomly assigned to either the intervention group (enhanced preoxygenation) or the nonintervention group (standard care) using a computer-generated sequence with allocation concealment via sealed envelopes. The intervention involved eight tidal volume breaths over 1 minute at an oxygen flow rate of 10 L/min via a face mask, supervised by an endoscopy nurse. The primary outcome was the incidence of hypoxemia (SpO2 < 90%) during the procedure.\n\nResults: A total of 326 participants were randomised: 163 to the intervention group and 163 to the control group, between November and December 2024. Analysis was conducted on 162 in the intervention group and 163 in the control group using an intention-to-treat approach. The intervention group had a significantly lower incidence of hypoxemia (6.5% vs. 25%, p < 0.001). No significant adverse events were reported.\n\nInterpretation: The enhanced preoxygenation protocol significantly reduced hypoxemia incidence during gastroscopy, particularly in high-risk patients.
