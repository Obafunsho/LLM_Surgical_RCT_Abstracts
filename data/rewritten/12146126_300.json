A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Customized Implants for Tibial Plateau Fractures\n\nBackground: This study aimed to assess the feasibility and effectiveness of customized implants for tibial plateau fractures (TPFs) and compare their mechanical strength to standard implants.\n\nMethods: A randomised controlled trial was conducted at our hospital from May 1, 2023, to June 1, 2023. Participants aged 18–80 years with TPFs requiring surgical open reduction with internal fixation were included. Patients were randomised to receive either customized implants or standard medial dual plates (MDPs). The primary outcome was the Lysholm score, measured at 12 months post-surgery. Secondary outcomes included knee range of motion (ROM) and EQ-5D-3L score. Randomisation was computer-generated, and allocation was concealed using sealed envelopes. Blinding was not applied.\n\nResults: Ten patients were randomised, with five receiving customized implants and five receiving MDPs. The analysis was per-protocol. The customized implant group showed a mean Lysholm score of 88.6, while the MDP group had a score of 85.2. The mean difference was 3.4 (95% CI 1.2 to 5.6; p = 0.02). Knee ROM was 103.5° in the customized group compared to 98.2° in the MDP group. The EQ-5D-3L score was 0.87 in the customized group and 0.82 in the MDP group. No adverse events were reported in either group.\n\nInterpretation: Customized implants demonstrated comparable mechanical strength to standard implants and improved functional outcomes in TPFs. This approach offers a viable alternative for managing complex fractures, with the potential for enhanced patient recovery and satisfaction.\n\nTrial registration: 2022KY108-KS001\n\nFunding: Not specified.",
