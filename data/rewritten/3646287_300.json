A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Fetal Striatal Transplantation in Huntington's Disease\n\nBackground: Huntington's disease (HD) is a fatal neurodegenerative disorder with progressive motor, cognitive, and behavioural decline. This study assesses the safety and efficacy of fetal striatal transplantation in HD.\n\nMethods: In this randomised controlled trial, 17 patients with mild HD from the NEST-UK cohort were included. Five patients were randomly selected for bilateral fetal striatal transplantation, while 12 served as controls. The primary outcome was the change in the Unified Huntington's Disease Rating Scale (UHDRS) motor score over 10 years. Randomisation was conducted using a computer-generated sequence, and allocation was concealed. The study was open-label, with no blinding of patients or clinicians.\n\nResults: Between 2000 and 2003, five patients received transplants. No significant differences were observed in UHDRS scores between the transplant and control groups over 10 years. The mean difference in UHDRS motor score was not significant (p > 0.05). Adverse events included transient renal function decline and anaemia, resolving after immunosuppression cessation. Patient 1 developed renal cell carcinoma, unrelated to the transplant. No significant placebo effects were noted. Raclopride PET indicated no surviving striatal graft tissue. The trial was not powered to detect efficacy, with an effect size of 0.74.\n\nInterpretation: Fetal striatal transplantation in HD is safe but did not demonstrate significant clinical benefit in this small cohort. The lack of efficacy may relate to the small amount of grafted tissue. Further research with larger graft volumes and optimised protocols is warranted to explore potential benefits.\n\nTrial registration: ISRCTN36485475.\n\nFunding: The study was funded by the NEST-UK consortium.",
