This study aimed to determine if a decision aid and motivational interviewing could increase referrals to orthopaedic surgery and willingness to undergo TKA among black patients.\n\nMethods: A two-group randomised controlled trial was conducted with 493 black adults aged ≥50 with moderate to severe knee OA, recruited from urban primary care clinics. Participants were randomised to receive either a decision-aid video and motivational interviewing or an educational booklet on OA. The primary outcome was referral to orthopaedic surgery at 12 months, defined as a recommendation or prescription for orthopaedic evaluation. The secondary outcome was willingness to undergo TKA. Randomisation was computer-generated, and allocation was concealed. Blinding was not specified.\n\nResults: Of 493 randomised, 253 were in the control group and 240 in the treatment group. Analysis was intention-to-treat. Referral rates were 36% in the control group and 32% in the treatment group (OR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.56–1.18; p = 0.277). Willingness to undergo TKA did not differ at 2 weeks (OR, 1.06; p = 0.779) or 12 months (OR, 1.10; p = 0.679). No adverse events were reported.\n\nInterpretation: The decision aid and motivational interviewing intervention did not improve referrals or willingness for TKA compared to the control. Further research is needed to develop effective tools for improving surgical treatment decisions in OA.\n\nTrial registration: Not provided.\n\nFunding: Not specified.",
