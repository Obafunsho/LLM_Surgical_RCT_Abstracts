  "abstract": "1. A 250-word version\n\nBackground: This study aimed to enhance awareness and understanding of renal cancer associated with end-stage renal disease (ESRD), focusing on cases where bone metastasis in the humerus is the initial clinical sign. Methods: A case report was conducted involving a 58-year-old male patient with a history of multiple renal transplants and over 20 years of maintenance dialysis therapy. The patient presented with left shoulder pain, and CT imaging revealed osteolytic destruction and fracture in the left humerus. An 18 F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/CT scan detected soft tissue lesions in the left kidney with increased fluorodeoxyglucose uptake. A biopsy of the left humerus confirmed metastatic renal cancer. Results: The patient opted for conservative treatment, with immobilization of the humerus to stabilize the affected area. No additional active treatment for renal cancer was undertaken. As of the time of submission, the patient's pain had intensified, requiring oral pain medication for symptomatic relief. Interpretation: The case highlights the diagnostic importance of positron emission tomography/computed tomography imaging in identifying renal cancer in ESRD patients, especially when clinical symptoms are atypical and do not present the classic \"renal cancer triad.\" This report underscores the need for increased clinician awareness and consideration of renal cancer in ESRD patients presenting with unusual symptoms. Trial registration: Not applicable. Funding: Not specified.",
