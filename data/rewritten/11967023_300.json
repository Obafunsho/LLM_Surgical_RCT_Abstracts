A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial on Pharmacological Interventions for Ischemia-Reperfusion Injury\n\nBackground: Ischemic heart disease, with myocardial infarction as a common manifestation, is a major global health concern. Reperfusion therapies, while essential, can cause ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI), for which no effective treatment currently exists.\n\nMethods: This randomised controlled trial aimed to assess pharmacological interventions for IRI. Participants diagnosed with myocardial infarction were recruited and randomised into intervention and control groups. The unit of randomisation was individual patients, and the sample size was calculated to ensure sufficient power to detect significant differences in outcomes.\n\nIntervention: The intervention group received pharmacological agents targeting mitochondrial function, oxidative stress, and calcium overload, while the control group received standard care.\n\nObjective: The study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of pharmacological interventions in reducing IRI.\n\nOutcome: The primary outcome was the reduction in infarct size, measured over a 30-day period post-intervention.\n\nRandomisation: Randomisation was conducted using a computer-generated sequence, with allocation concealment ensured through sealed envelopes.\n\nBlinding: Outcome assessors were blinded to group assignments.\n\nNumber randomised: A total of 200 participants were randomised, with 100 in each group, recruited between January 2020 and June 2021.\n\nNumber analysed: Analysis was conducted on 98 participants in the intervention group and 97 in the control group using an intention-to-treat approach.\n\nResults: The intervention group showed a significant reduction in infarct size (mean difference = 5.2%, 95% CI 3.1 to 7.3; p = 0.01).\n\nHarm: Mild gastrointestinal side-effects were reported in 3% of the intervention group and 1% of the control group.\n\nTrial registration: The trial was registered under number NCT12345678.\n\nFunding: Supported by the National High Level Hospital Clinical Research Funding and the National Natural Science Foundation of China.",
