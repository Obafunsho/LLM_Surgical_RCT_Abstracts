The study group consisted of 164 miniplates in 42 patients, divided into two groups based on the operator: surgical residents (Group 1) and consultant surgeons (Group 2). The primary outcome was the failure rate of miniplates, measured over the treatment duration.\n\nResults: The overall failure rate of miniplates was 23.8% (39/164). The failure rate for Group 1 was 31.4% (27/86), while for Group 2, it was 15.3% (12/78) (p < 0.05). Out of all failed miniplates, 69.2% were placed by residents and 30.8% by consultants. No significant differences in failure rates were observed between genders or placement sites.\n\nInterpretation: The failure rate of miniplates was significantly higher when placed by surgical residents compared to consultant surgeons, suggesting that surgical experience plays a crucial role in reducing failure rates. This highlights the need for careful supervision of residents during miniplate placement to improve outcomes.",
