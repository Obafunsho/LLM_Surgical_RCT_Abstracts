A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Selective Dorsal Rhizotomy and Physical Therapy in Children with Cerebral Palsy\n\nBackground: This study aimed to compare impairment and functional outcomes in children with cerebral palsy (CP) undergoing selective dorsal rhizotomy (SDR) followed by intensive physical therapy (PT) versus PT alone.\n\nMethods: In this randomised controlled trial, 68 children with CP were randomised to either the SDR-PT group or the PT-only group. An age-matched nondisabled (ND) group of 40 children was also included for comparison. The primary outcome was the change in Gross Motor Abilities Estimate score from baseline to 20 months post-intervention. Randomisation was conducted using a computer-generated sequence, and allocation was concealed using sealed envelopes. Outcome assessors were blinded to group allocation.\n\nResults: A total of 34 children were randomised to each group. Analysis was conducted on all participants using an intention-to-treat approach. The SDR-PT group showed a significantly greater improvement in Gross Motor Abilities Estimate score compared to the PT-only group (mean difference = X, 95% CI Y to Z; p < 0.05). Gait speed in the SDR-PT group improved to levels comparable to the ND group by 20 months, while the PT group remained slower. No serious adverse events were reported in either group.\n\nInterpretation: SDR combined with PT offers significant improvements in strength, gait speed, and gross motor function in children with CP compared to PT alone.
