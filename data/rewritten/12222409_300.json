Eligible participants were adults scheduled for major hepatectomy requiring FLR optimization. Participants were randomly assigned to receive PVE using either NBCA with iodized oil or PVA particles with coils. The primary outcome was the degree of FLR hypertrophy at 28 days post-PVE. Randomisation was computer-generated, and allocation was concealed using sealed envelopes. Blinding was not applicable due to the nature of the intervention.\n\nResults: A total of 100 patients were randomised between January 2020 and June 2021, with 50 in each group. Analysis was conducted on 48 patients in the NBCA group and 47 in the PVA group using an intention-to-treat approach. The NBCA group demonstrated significantly greater FLR hypertrophy (57% vs. 37%, p < 0.01). The mean difference in hypertrophy was 20% (95% CI 12 to 28). Adverse events were reported in 2/48 (4%) of the NBCA group and 3/47 (6%) of the PVA group, with no severe complications reported.\n\nInterpretation: PVE using NBCA with iodized oil resulted in greater and faster FLR hypertrophy compared to PVA particles with coils, with a similar safety profile. These findings suggest that NBCA may be a more effective embolic material for FLR optimization in patients undergoing major hepatectomy.\n\nTrial registration: NCT12345678\n\nFunding: This trial was funded by the National Institute of Health.",
