This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of DBS targeted at the ventral anterior limb of the internal capsule (vALIC) in TRD patients.\n\nMethods: This randomised controlled trial included 25 patients with TRD recruited from two hospitals in the Netherlands. Participants met criteria for major depressive disorder and had failed multiple treatment steps. All patients underwent DBS surgery and entered a 1-year optimisation phase followed by a 1-year open-label maintenance phase. Depression severity was assessed using the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D-17), Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS), and self-reported Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology (IDS-SR). The primary outcome was the response rate (≥50% HAM-D-17 score reduction) after the maintenance phase.\n\nResults: Of the 25 patients, 21 entered and 18 completed the maintenance phase. Eight patients were classified as responders (observed response rate: 44.4%; intention-to-treat: 32.0%). HAM-D-17 and MADRS scores remained stable, while IDS-SR scores decreased significantly (p=0.008). Four serious adverse events occurred, none related to DBS.\n\nInterpretation: vALIC DBS demonstrated continued efficacy in TRD patients 2 years post-surgery, with stable clinician-rated symptoms and improved patient-rated symptoms. This supports DBS as a viable treatment option for TRD.\n\nTrial registration: NTR2118.\n\nFunding: Not specified.",
