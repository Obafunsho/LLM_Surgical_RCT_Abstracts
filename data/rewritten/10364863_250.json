Participants were postmenopausal women with endocrine receptor-positive breast cancer who underwent breast-conserving surgery. Tumour blocks from 1204 patients were analysed using the PAM-50 assay. Randomisation was stratified by treatment group, and allocation was concealed. Outcome assessors were blinded. The primary outcome was local recurrence risk over a median follow-up of 10.8 years.\n\nResults: Of 1204 patients, 1034 received radiotherapy. At 10.8 years, 23 local recurrences were observed, with a 2.2% overall risk. Patients with a low ROR score (<57) had significantly lower local recurrence rates at 5 years (0.1% vs. 2.2%; SHR 17.18, 95% CI 2.06 to 142.88; p=0.009) and 10 years (0.9% vs. 3.8%; SHR 4.76, 95% CI 1.72 to 13.17; p=0.003). Multivariable analysis confirmed ROR score as an independent prognostic factor. PAM-50 was not predictive of radiotherapy benefit. No adverse events were reported.\n\nTrial registration: NCT00291759\n\nFunding: Not specified.",
