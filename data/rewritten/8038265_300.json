Eligible patients scheduled for elective colonic resection were randomised to MOABP or NBP. MOABP involved mechanical preparation and oral antibiotics (2 g neomycin, 2 g metronidazole) the day before surgery. The primary outcome was SSI rate within 30 days post-surgery. Randomisation was computer-generated with concealed allocation. Blinding was applied to recruiters, treating physicians, surgeons, data collectors, and analysts.\n\nResults: A total of 381 patients were randomised: 217 to right colectomy (106 MOABP, 111 NBP) and 164 to left colectomy (84 MOABP, 80 NBP). In right colectomy, SSI rates were 7% (MOABP) and 9% (NBP) (OR 0.71, 95% CI 0.26 to 1.95; P = 0.510). In left colectomy, SSI rates were 6% (MOABP) and 10% (NBP) (OR 0.57, 95% CI 0.18 to 1.82; P = 0.338). The mean Comprehensive Complication Index (CCI) scores were similar between groups. No significant differences in overall morbidity or adverse events were observed.\n\nInterpretation: MOABP did not significantly reduce SSI rates or complications compared to NBP in either right or left colectomy. The findings suggest no advantage of MOABP over NBP, highlighting the need for further research to confirm these results.\n\nTrial registration: NCT02652637\n\nFunding: Vatsatautien Tutkimussäätiö Foundation, Mary and Georg Ehrnrooth’s Foundation, Finnish Cancer Foundation, Helsinki University Research Funds.",
