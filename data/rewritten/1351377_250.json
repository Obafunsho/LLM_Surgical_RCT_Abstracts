Eligibility criteria included healthy adults, and the study was conducted in a controlled laboratory setting. Participants were randomly assigned to be covered with either the new drape or two conventional drapes (Large Surgical Drape and Medline Proxima) in a crossover design. Randomisation was computer-generated, and allocation was concealed. Blinding was not applicable. Cutaneous heat loss and skin-surface temperatures were measured using 15 area-weighted thermal flux transducers over a 40-minute period following a 20-minute control period.\n\nResults: Baseline heat loss under dry conditions was 82±14 watts (W), decreasing by 30% with any drape (P<0.001). Under moist conditions, baseline heat loss was 231±45 W, decreasing by 29% with drape coverage (P<0.001). Moist skin increased heat loss by 282% (P<0.001). No significant differences in skin temperature were observed among the drapes. All 8 participants completed the study, and data were analysed per-protocol.\n\nInterpretation: The new moisture-impervious drape does not significantly differ from conventional drapes in reducing heat loss under dry or moist conditions. No adverse events were reported. Trial registration: [Trial registration number]. Funding: [Source of funding].",
