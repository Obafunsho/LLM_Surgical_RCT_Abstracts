A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial on Distal Radial Artery Access in Pediatric Catheterization\n\nBackground: Distal radial artery (DRA) access is an infrequent alternative for pediatric catheterization. This study evaluates the feasibility of DRA access by measuring the DRA diameter in the anatomic snuffbox (AS).\n\nMethods: We conducted a retrospective review of clinical and vascular ultrasound data of 412 children aged 3–12 years, scheduled for arterial blood gas analysis via the DRA due to serious respiratory diseases, at Changzhou Second People's Hospital between June 2023 and October 2023. The primary outcome was the corrected DRA diameter in the AS.\n\nResults: The corrected DRA diameter was 1.97 ± 0.37 mm, with no significant difference between males (1.98 ± 0.38 mm) and females (1.95 ± 0.35 mm) (p = 0.457). The DRA diameter was smaller than the proximal radial artery (PRA) diameter (1.97 ± 0.37 mm vs. 2.05 ± 0.33 mm, p < 0.001) but larger than the ulnar artery (UA) diameter (1.97 ± 0.37 mm vs. 1.88 ± 0.33 mm, p < 0.001). The proportions of patients with a DRA diameter greater than 2.0 mm and 1.5 mm were 38.83% and 86.89%, respectively. DRA diameter showed significant correlations with age, height, weight, BMI, wrist circumference, PRA diameter, and UA diameter (p < 0.01).\n\nInterpretation: The DRA diameter in children increases with age, making catheterization via DRA access theoretically feasible. Preoperative evaluation of the vessel diameter and intraoperative ultrasound-guided intervention are recommended for pediatric catheterization via DRA access. The study highlights the potential of DRA access as a viable option for pediatric catheterization, emphasizing the importance of vessel diameter assessment in clinical practice.",
