A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Supervised Exercise Versus Standard Care Following Lower Limb Revascularisation in Peripheral Arterial Disease\n\nBackground: Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is characterised by lower limb arterial obstruction, often managed with medical and exercise therapy. This study assesses the impact of supervised exercise versus standard care after lower limb revascularisation.\n\nMethods: This randomised controlled trial included 376 PAD patients, aged 18 and older, post-successful revascularisation. Participants were randomised to supervised exercise or standard care. The primary outcome was maximum walking distance (MWD) on a treadmill, assessed over six weeks to five years. Randomisation was computer-generated with concealed allocation. Outcome assessors were blinded.\n\nResults: A total of 376 participants were randomised: 189 to the exercise group and 187 to standard care. Analysis included 89 in the exercise group and 108 in standard care, using an intention-to-treat approach. Exercise showed no significant improvement in MWD from baseline (MD 159.47 m, 95% CI -36.43 to 355.38). However, exercise may improve absolute MWD at follow-up (MD 301.89 m, 95% CI 138.13 to 465.65). No adverse events were reported. Secondary outcomes, including six-minute walk test, pain-free walking distance, ankle-brachial index, mortality, and quality of life, showed very uncertain evidence of benefit.\n\nInterpretation: The evidence is very uncertain regarding the benefits of supervised exercise post-revascularisation in PAD. Although no harm was reported, further large-scale trials are needed to confirm these findings. Trial registration: Not provided. Funding: Not reported.",
