Adults with suspected appendicitis, symptoms for less than 24 hours, and an Adult Appendicitis Score (AAS) of 11–15 were eligible. Participants were randomised 1:1 to imaging or observation groups using computer-based block randomisation. The primary outcome was the number of patients requiring treatment for acute appendicitis within 30 days. The analysis was intention-to-treat.\n\nResults: From May 2016 to March 2020, 185 patients were randomised: 93 to imaging and 92 to observation. After exclusions, 93 and 88 patients were analysed, respectively. In the imaging group, 72% required treatment for appendicitis compared to 57% in the observation group (odds ratio 0.51, 95% CI 0.27 to 0.95; p = 0.032). No significant difference was found in complicated appendicitis (4% vs 2%) or negative appendicectomies (1% vs 1%). No adverse events were reported.\n\nInterpretation: Score-based observation reduces the number of patients requiring treatment for appendicitis compared to early imaging.
