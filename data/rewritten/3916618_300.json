A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial on the Effects of Unloader Knee Braces on Tibiofemoral Joint Loading\n\nBackground: Unloader knee braces are commonly used after tibiofemoral articular cartilage repair, yet their effectiveness in patients with normal knee alignment remains uncertain. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of varus and valgus adjustments on knee joint loading and muscle activation.\n\nMethods: In this randomised controlled trial, 20 healthy participants (mean age 28.3 years; BMI 22.9 kg/m²) with normal knee alignment were recruited. Participants were randomly assigned to varus, valgus, or no brace conditions. The primary outcome was the knee adduction moment, assessed during gait analysis over a specified timeframe. Randomisation was computer-generated, and allocation concealment was ensured. Outcome assessors were blinded to group assignments.\n\nResults: Analysis revealed no significant differences between braced and non-braced conditions in kinetic or muscle activity parameters. Varus bracing increased knee adduction moments and resulted in a more laterally directed muscular activation profile. Valgus bracing also increased knee adduction moments but produced a similar lateral activation profile. Despite the lack of statistical significance, the observed effect sizes were moderate to large, suggesting the potential for further investigation. No adverse events were reported during the study.\n\nInterpretation: The findings indicate inconsistencies in knee kinetics and muscle activation strategies with varus and valgus bracing. Although the results were not statistically significant, the effect sizes imply that unloader bracing may not be beneficial for individuals with normally aligned knees following cartilage repair. These results provide valuable pilot data for future research.\n\nTrial registration: [Trial registration number]\n\nFunding: [Source of funding]",
