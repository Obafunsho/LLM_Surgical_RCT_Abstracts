A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Perioperative Normoxia vs. Hyperoxia in Cyanotic Neonates Undergoing Cardiopulmonary Bypass\n\nBackground: Supra-physiologic oxygen exposure is associated with oxidative stress and adverse outcomes. This study assesses the feasibility, safety, and oxidative stress response of perioperative normoxia versus hyperoxia in cyanotic neonates undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass.\n\nMethods: This randomised controlled trial enrolled 29 neonates with cyanotic congenital heart disease at a single tertiary care center. Eligibility criteria included neonates requiring cardiopulmonary bypass. Participants were randomised to normoxia (PaO2 60–100 mmHg) or hyperoxia (PaO2 200–300 mmHg) during bypass. The primary outcome was serum thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) measured at baseline, 2, 6, and 24 hours postoperatively. Randomisation was computer-generated, and allocation was concealed. Outcome assessors were blinded.\n\nResults: Twenty-nine neonates (median age 5 days) were randomised: 15 to normoxia and 14 to hyperoxia. Mean PaO2 during bypass was 106±27 mmHg in the normoxia group and 256±29 mmHg in the hyperoxia group (p<0.0001). TBARS levels were significantly lower in the normoxia group at 2 hours (1.21±0.26 vs 1.93±0.63), 6 hours (1.09±0.25 vs 1.77±0.7), and 24 hours (0.96±0.16 vs 1.41±0.29); all p<0.01. Other oxidative stress biomarkers were also lower in the normoxia group (p<0.01). Safety outcomes, including in-hospital mortality and morbidities, were similar between groups. No severe adverse events were reported.\n\nInterpretation: Perioperative normoxia is feasible, safe, and reduces oxidative stress in cyanotic neonates undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass. These findings warrant further investigation into clinical outcomes and end-organ injury.\n\nTrial registration: [Trial registration number]\n\nFunding: [Source of funding]",
