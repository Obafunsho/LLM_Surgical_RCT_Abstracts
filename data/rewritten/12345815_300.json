This study assesses the cost-effectiveness of rubber band ligation (RBL) compared to hemorrhoidectomy for grade III hemorrhoids.\n\nMethods: Conducted as a multicenter, randomised controlled trial in 10 Dutch hospitals, 79 adults with symptomatic grade III hemorrhoids were enrolled from September 2019 to November 2022. Participants were randomly assigned to RBL (n=46) or hemorrhoidectomy (n=33). The primary outcomes were cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained and cost per recurrence avoided over 24 months. Randomisation was computer-generated, with allocation concealment. Blinding was not applied.\n\nResults: Hemorrhoidectomy resulted in a QALY difference of 0.08 (95% CI, 0.06–0.16; p=0.034) and a recurrence difference of 33.5% (95% CI, 15.3%–51.7%; p=0.002). Hospital costs were higher for hemorrhoidectomy (€1364; 95% CI, 895–1834; p<0.001), as were societal costs (€1984; 95% CI, –132 to 4101; p=0.066). The incremental cost-utility ratio was €24,042 per QALY gained, and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was €5918 per recurrence avoided. No adverse events were reported. The probability of hemorrhoidectomy being cost-effective was 45.5% at €20,000 per QALY and 83.9% at €50,000 per QALY. For recurrence avoidance, probabilities were 98.3% and 99.8%, respectively.\n\nInterpretation: Hemorrhoidectomy provides superior clinical outcomes but incurs higher costs. Its cost-effectiveness varies with societal willingness-to-pay thresholds. Caution is advised before discarding it as a first-line treatment based solely on costs or limited operating room availability.\n\nTrial registration: NCT04621695\n\nFunding: Not specified.",
