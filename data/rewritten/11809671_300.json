A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Off-Pump versus On-Pump Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting\n\nBackground: Coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) is performed with or without cardiopulmonary bypass, known as on-pump and off-pump CABG, respectively. The optimal technique remains uncertain.\n\nMethods: This randomised controlled trial included 10,716 participants with ischaemic heart disease. Participants were randomised to receive either off-pump or on-pump CABG. Randomisation was conducted using a computer-generated sequence with allocation concealment via sealed envelopes. Blinding was not feasible for patients and clinicians, but outcome assessors were blinded. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality, measured over a follow-up period of 12 months. Data were analysed using an intention-to-treat approach.\n\nResults: A total of 5,180 participants were randomised to off-pump CABG and 5,144 to on-pump CABG. Analysis showed increased all-cause mortality in the off-pump group (3.7%) compared to the on-pump group (3.1%), with a risk ratio of 1.24 (95% CI 1.01 to 1.53; p = 0.04). In trials at low risk of bias, the effect was corroborated (6.2% vs. 4.5%; RR 1.35, 95% CI 1.07 to 1.70; p = 0.01). Off-pump CABG resulted in fewer distal anastomoses (mean difference -0.28; 95% CI -0.40 to -0.16; p < 0.00001). No significant differences were observed in myocardial infarction, stroke, renal insufficiency, or coronary re-intervention. Off-pump CABG reduced post-operative atrial fibrillation, but this was not significant in low-bias trials. Adverse events were not significantly different between groups.\n\nInterpretation: On-pump CABG demonstrated better long-term survival and should remain the standard treatment. Off-pump CABG may be considered when contraindications to cardiopulmonary bypass exist. Further trials are needed to explore optimal treatment in such cases.\n\nTrial registration: [Trial registration number]\n\nFunding: [Source of funding]",
