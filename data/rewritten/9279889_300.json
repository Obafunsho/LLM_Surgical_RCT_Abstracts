A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial on Antioxidant Therapy in the Perinatal Period\n\nBackground: Oxidative stress, characterized by an imbalance between reactive oxygen/nitrogen species and antioxidants, contributes to adverse pregnancy outcomes and fetal programming. This study investigates the impact of antioxidant therapy on reducing oxidative stress-related complications during the perinatal period.\n\nMethods: Conducted at a tertiary care center, this randomised controlled trial included pregnant women aged 18-40 years with gestational ages between 20-28 weeks, at risk of oxidative stress-related complications. Participants were randomised using a computer-generated sequence, with allocation concealment ensured through sealed envelopes. The intervention group received antioxidant therapy, while the control group received a placebo. Blinding was applied to outcome assessors, patients, and clinicians.\n\nResults: A total of 200 participants were randomised: 100 to the intervention group and 100 to the control group, between January 2020 and June 2021. The primary outcome was the incidence of preterm birth, assessed until delivery. The intervention group demonstrated a significant reduction in preterm birth rates compared to the control group (mean difference = 10%, 95% CI 5% to 15%; p = 0.01). Analysis was conducted using an intention-to-treat approach, with 98 participants in the intervention group and 97 in the control group. Adverse events were mild, occurring in 3% of the intervention group and 1% of the control group.\n\nInterpretation: Antioxidant therapy effectively reduces the risk of preterm birth in women at risk of oxidative stress-related complications. These findings support the potential of antioxidant therapy as a preventive strategy in high-risk pregnancies. Further studies are warranted to assess long-term outcomes and broader applications.\n\nTrial registration: NCT12345678\n\nFunding: This trial was funded by the National Institutes of Health.",
