Animals were randomly assigned to receive MIRTH or serve as controls. The primary outcome was the change in left ventricular performance, measured by contractility and mechanical efficiency, over a 90-day period. Randomisation was achieved using a computer-generated sequence, and allocation was concealed using sealed envelopes. Blinding was not applicable due to the nature of the intervention.\n\nResults: A total of 33 animals were randomised: 17 with healthy myocardium and 16 with ischemic cardiomyopathy. MIRTH significantly improved left ventricular performance in cardiomyopathic animals, with increased contractility and mechanical efficiency (p < 0.05). No adverse events related to myocardial erosion were observed. Two early implants failed due to suture abrasion, prompting a change to ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene suture.\n\nInterpretation: MIRTH offers a promising approach to ventricular remodeling, demonstrating significant improvements in cardiac performance in cardiomyopathic swine. Further studies are needed to explore its potential in clinical settings.\n\nTrial registration: Not provided.\n\nFunding: Supported by the Division of Intramural Research, National Heart Lung and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health USA (grant Z01-HL006040).",
