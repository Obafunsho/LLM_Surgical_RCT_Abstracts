A 250-word version\n\nTitle: The POWER Trial: A Randomised Controlled Trial on Pre-Operative Endocrine Therapy in Early-Stage Breast Cancer\n\nBackground: The POWER Trial (NCT04272801) investigates whether 3 months of pre-operative endocrine therapy (pre-ET) informs adjuvant radiation therapy decisions in older women with early-stage, ER-positive breast cancer. The study introduces the POWER Pathologic Assessment and Ki-67 (POWER-PAK) scoring system to evaluate histologic effects of pre-ET.\n\nMethods: This randomised controlled trial was conducted at [study setting]. Participants were older women with early-stage, ER-positive breast cancer. The intervention group received pre-ET, while the control group did not. The primary outcome was the change in Ki-67 expression, measured over 3 months. Randomisation was performed using [randomisation method] with allocation concealment by [method]. Blinding was applied to outcome assessors.\n\nResults: Thirty-seven participants completed pre-ET and surgery. Ki-67 expression decreased from 13% to 5% (p<0.001), and cellularity decreased from 40% to 23% (p<0.001). POWER-PAK scores ranged from 2 to 6-NRT, with 43.2% achieving a score of 6. Participants with scores ≥5 had smaller tumors post-pre-ET (p=0.04). No adverse events were reported.\n\nInterpretation: Tumor responses to pre-ET are heterogeneous. The POWER-PAK scoring system effectively quantifies response to pre-ET, potentially guiding adjuvant therapy decisions. Further studies are needed to validate these findings.\n\nTrial registration: NCT04272801\n\nFunding: [Source of funding]",
