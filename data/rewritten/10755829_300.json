A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial on Arrhythmia Management in Tetralogy of Fallot\n\nBackground: Arrhythmias significantly affect patients with tetralogy of Fallot (ToF), necessitating effective management strategies. This study evaluates the efficacy of pharmacologic versus interventional therapies in managing arrhythmias in ToF patients.\n\nMethods: Conducted at a tertiary care center, this randomised controlled trial included ToF patients with documented arrhythmias. The unit of randomisation was the individual patient, with a sample size calculated to detect a clinically significant difference in arrhythmia control. Participants were randomised to receive either pharmacologic therapy or interventional therapy. Randomisation was computer-generated, and allocation was concealed using sealed envelopes. Outcome assessors were blinded to group assignments.\n\nResults: A total of 200 participants were randomised: 100 to the pharmacologic group and 100 to the interventional group, between January 2020 and June 2021. Analysis was conducted on 98 participants in the pharmacologic group and 97 in the interventional group using an intention-to-treat approach. The primary outcome was arrhythmia control over a 12-month period. The interventional group demonstrated a significant improvement in arrhythmia control (mean difference = 5.2, 95% CI 3.1 to 7.3; p = 0.01). Adverse events occurred in 3% of the pharmacologic group and 1% of the interventional group, with mild gastrointestinal side-effects reported.\n\nInterpretation: Interventional therapy proved more effective than pharmacologic therapy in controlling arrhythmias in ToF patients. These findings suggest that interventional strategies should be considered in the management of arrhythmias in this population. Further research is warranted to optimize treatment protocols and improve patient outcomes.\n\nTrial registration: NCT12345678\n\nFunding: This trial was funded by the National Institutes of Health.",
