A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial Comparing Core Decompression and Vascularized Fibular Grafting for Osteonecrosis of the Femoral Head\n\nBackground: Osteonecrosis of the femoral head presents a treatment challenge. This study compares core decompression and vascularized fibular grafting in terms of femoral head vascularity, disease progression, and hip function.\n\nMethods: This randomised controlled trial was conducted at Zhongshan Hospital, Fudan University, from June 2010 to October 2012. Eligible participants had ARCO Stages I-IIIB bilateral osteonecrosis. Of 51 potential participants, 33 met inclusion criteria, and 27 were randomised. Each patient's hips were randomly assigned to core decompression or fibular grafting. SPECT/CT assessed vascularity at baseline, 6, and 36 months. MRI evaluated ARCO stage progression at baseline, 6, 12, 24, and 36 months. Harris hip score (HHS) was measured pre-treatment and at 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, and 36 months. Randomisation was by bilateral hip assignment; allocation concealment and blinding details were not specified.\n\nResults: At 6 and 36 months, fibular-grafted hips showed higher vascularity than decompression-treated hips (p < 0.001). ARCO stage progression was more severe in decompression-treated hips at 36 months (p = 0.027). HHS favored fibular grafting from 18 months onward (p < 0.001). No significant difference in progression to THA was observed (p = 0.893). Six patients were lost to follow-up.\n\nInterpretation: Vascularized fibular grafting improved vascularity and reduced osteonecrosis progression compared to core decompression. HHS differences became clinically significant by 18 months. No adverse events were reported. Trial registration and funding details were not provided.",
