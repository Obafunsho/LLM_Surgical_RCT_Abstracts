A 300-word version\n\nTitle: A Randomised Controlled Trial on Extracellular Vesicles in PRBC Transfusion\n\nBackground: This study evaluates the involvement of extracellular vesicles (EVs) in transfusion-related immunomodulation (TRIM) in postoperative ICU patients.\n\nMethods: Conducted at the Medical University of Vienna, this prospective subanalysis of a recent observational feasibility study included 23 postoperative ICU patients: 5 after open aortic surgery, 9 after bilateral lung transplantation, and 9 after other surgeries. Eligibility criteria were age 18-99 years and PRBC transfusion postoperatively. Plasma samples were collected three times before and after leukoreduced PRBC transfusion at 30-min intervals. EVs were analyzed using flow cytometry. Statistical analysis included Spearman’s correlation, linear mixed models, and Wilcoxon matched-pairs test.\n\nResults: All EV subgroups were detectable in PRBC samples (n=23) and plasma samples (n=138). EV concentrations did not correlate with storage time. Total EVs, EryEVs, total PEVs, and GEVs increased post-transfusion compared to baseline in the entire cohort. Changes in plasma EV counts correlated with PRBC storage time. No adverse events were reported.\n\nInterpretation: EVs were detectable in all PRBC and plasma samples. Individual EV subtypes increased after transfusion, correlating with storage duration. Larger clinical studies are warranted to explore EVs' role in TRIM.\n\nTrial registration: Clinicaltrials.gov: NCT03782623.\n\nFunding: Not specified.",
