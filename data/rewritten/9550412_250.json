A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Fenestrated and Branched Endovascular Aneurysm Repair (F/B-EVAR) for Thoracoabdominal Aortic Aneurysm\n\nBackground: Fenestrated and branched endovascular aneurysm repair (F/B-EVAR) is a less invasive treatment for thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm (TAAA) and complex abdominal aortic aneurysm. This study aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of F/B-EVAR compared to conventional open surgery.\n\nMethods: This randomised controlled trial was conducted at multiple centers in the USA, Europe, and Japan. Participants were patients with TAAA or complex AAA eligible for F/B-EVAR. The intervention group received F/B-EVAR, while the control group underwent conventional open surgery. The primary outcome was the incidence of spinal cord injury (SCI) within 30 days post-procedure. Randomisation was performed using a computer-generated sequence, and allocation was concealed using sealed envelopes. Blinding was not feasible due to the nature of the interventions.\n\nResults: A total of 200 participants were randomised: 100 to the F/B-EVAR group and 100 to the control group. Analysis was conducted on an intention-to-treat basis. The incidence of SCI was 5% in the F/B-EVAR group and 15% in the control group (p = 0.01). Adverse events were reported in 10% of the F/B-EVAR group and 20% of the control group.\n\nTrial registration: NCT12345678\n\nFunding: This trial was funded by the National Institutes of Health.",
