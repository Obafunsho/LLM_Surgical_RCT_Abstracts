A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Utilization of Optimal Medical Therapy in Chronic Limb Threatening Ischemia: A Randomised Controlled Trial\n\nBackground: The BEST-CLI trial, a multi-center randomised controlled trial, evaluates revascularization strategies in patients with chronic limb threatening ischemia (CLTI) and assesses the utilization of guideline-based optimal medical therapy (OMT) at trial enrollment.\n\nMethods: Participants were patients with CLTI enrolled across multiple centers. Eligibility criteria included diagnosis of CLTI. A multidisciplinary committee defined OMT criteria, including blood pressure and diabetic management, lipid-lowering and anti-platelet medication use, and smoking status. Randomisation was conducted at the patient level. Baseline characteristics and OMT adherence were evaluated using a linear regression model.\n\nResults: A total of 1830 patients were randomised. At randomization, 87% had hypertension, 69% had diabetes, 73% had hyperlipidemia, and 35% were current smokers. Only 25% met all four OMT criteria, while 38% met three, 24% met two, 11% met one, and 2% met none. Age ≥80 years, coronary artery disease, diabetes, and Hispanic ethnicity were positively associated with OMT adherence, while Black race was negatively associated. The primary outcome was the proportion of patients meeting OMT criteria at baseline.\n\nInterpretation: A significant gap exists in the adherence to OMT guidelines among CLTI patients at trial entry, indicating a need for improved medical management. Future analyses will assess changes in OMT adherence and their impact on clinical outcomes. Trial registration: [Trial registration number]. Funding: NIH-sponsored.",
