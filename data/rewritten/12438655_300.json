A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Neoadjuvant Targeted Therapy in EGFR-Mutant Resectable Lung Adenocarcinoma\n\nBackground: This study investigates the potential of neoadjuvant targeted therapy in improving outcomes for patients with EGFR-mutant resectable lung adenocarcinoma.\n\nMethods: A multicenter retrospective analysis was conducted involving 24 patients with stage IIA-IIIB EGFR-mutant lung adenocarcinoma treated with neoadjuvant targeted therapy followed by surgery from July 2019 to October 2024. The primary outcome was the objective response rate (ORR) post-treatment. Secondary outcomes included major pathologic response (MPR) and adverse events. \n\nResults: All 24 patients achieved successful R0 resection. The ORR was 83.3% (20/24), and the MPR was 37.5% (9/24), with 2 patients achieving pathological complete response (pCR). During neoadjuvant therapy, 54.2% (13/24) experienced grade 1-2 adverse events, with no grade 3 or higher events reported. Rash (16.7%), oral ulcers (8.3%), and diarrhea (8.3%) were the most common adverse events. The median follow-up was 33 months, with a 100% overall survival rate and disease-free survival rates of 91.1% at 1 year and 86.2% at 2 years.\n\nInterpretation: Neoadjuvant targeted therapy demonstrates a favorable safety profile and significant efficacy in EGFR-mutant resectable lung adenocarcinoma, with high ORR and MPR rates. The absence of severe adverse events and the promising survival outcomes suggest that this approach could be a viable neoadjuvant treatment option. Further randomized controlled trials are warranted to validate these findings and explore the long-term benefits of this therapeutic strategy.",
