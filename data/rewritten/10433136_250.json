Eligibility included hospitals performing lung cancer surgery using race-corrected PFTs. Participants were African American patients undergoing lung cancer resection from January 1, 2015, to September 31, 2022. Surgeons were randomised to receive clinical vignettes with race-corrected or race-neutral PFTs. The primary outcome was the change in treatment recommendations, measured immediately after vignette presentation.\n\nResults: Of 515 African American patients, 473 (91.8%) had race-corrected PFTs. Race-neutral equations would have decreased preoperative and postoperative FEV1 by 9.2% and 7.6%, respectively. Among 225 surgeons, those receiving race-corrected vignettes recommended lobectomy more frequently (79.2%) than those with race-neutral (52.8%) or other race/multiracial vignettes (61.7%).\n\nInterpretation: Removal of race correction in PFTs may alter treatment decisions, potentially exacerbating disparities in lung cancer surgery among African American patients. No adverse events were reported. Trial registration: [Trial registration number]. Funding: [Source of funding].",
