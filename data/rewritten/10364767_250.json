The primary outcome was treatment success, defined as resolution of appendicitis without appendicectomy within 10 days. Randomisation was stratified by centre, and allocation was concealed. Both patients and clinicians were blinded.\n\nResults: From May 2017 to September 2020, 72 patients were randomised (35 to antibiotics, 31 to placebo). Six were excluded post-randomisation. The treatment success rate was 97% (34/35) for antibiotics and 87% (27/31) for placebo, with a non-significant difference of 10% (90% CI -0.9 to 21; p = 0.142). No deaths occurred, and adverse events were similar between groups.\n\nInterpretation: The lack of statistical superiority of antibiotics over placebo suggests that a non-inferiority trial is warranted.
