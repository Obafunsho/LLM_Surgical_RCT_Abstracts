A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Cementless 3D-Printed vs. Cemented Tibial Components in TKA\n\nBackground: This study investigates the long-term migration of cementless 3D-printed and cemented tibial components in total knee arthroplasty (TKA) to assess the progression of migration beyond 2 years postoperatively.\n\nMethods: In this randomised controlled trial, 72 patients were randomised to receive either a cementless 3D-printed Triathlon Tritanium (Stryker) cruciate-retaining (CR) TKA or a cemented Triathlon CR (Stryker) TKA. The primary outcome, maximum total point motion (MTPM), was measured using radiostereometric analysis (RSA) at baseline, 3 months, and 1, 2, and 5 years postoperatively. Randomisation was computer-generated, and allocation was concealed. Patients and outcome assessors were blinded. The sample size was calculated to detect a difference beyond the 0.13 mm measurement error of MTPM with 80% power and 0.05 alpha.\n\nResults: At 5 years, the mean MTPM was 0.66 mm (95% CI, 0.56 to 0.78 mm) for the cementless group and 0.53 mm (95% CI, 0.43 to 0.64 mm) for the cemented group (p = 0.09). Between 2 and 5 years, no progression in mean MTPM was observed for the cementless group (0.02 mm; 95% CI, −0.06 to 0.10 mm), while the cemented group showed progression (0.07 mm; 95% CI, 0.00 to 0.14 mm). One cementless and four cemented implants were continuously migrating. Clinical scores were comparable between groups. No adverse events related to the implants were reported.\n\nInterpretation: No significant difference in mean migration was found at 5 years between the cementless and cemented TKA implants. The cemented implant showed migration progression beyond 2 years, while the cementless implant remained stable after initial early migration.\n\nTrial registration: NCT02578446\n\nFunding: Funded by Stryker.",
