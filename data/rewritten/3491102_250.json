The vasoactive-inotropic score (VIS) quantifies this support in pediatric patients and may be applicable to adults. This study evaluates VIS in adults undergoing cardiac surgery.\n\nMethods: In a randomised controlled trial, 50 adult patients at high risk of left ventricular dysfunction post-cardiac surgery were randomised to either temporary biventricular pacing or standard care (no pacing) after cardiopulmonary bypass. The trial was conducted between April 2007 and June 2011. VIS was measured after cardiopulmonary bypass, after sternal closure, and 0–7 hours post-intensive care unit (ICU) admission. Randomisation was computer-generated, and allocation was concealed. Blinding was not specified.\n\nResults: VIS decreased in the biventricular pacing group from 12.0±1.5 to 10.5±2.0, while it increased in the standard care group from 12.5±1.9 to 15.5±2.9 over the initial three collection points (mean duration 131 minutes). The difference in VIS slopes was statistically significant (p=0.02) and persisted for the first hour in the ICU but not beyond (p=0.26). No adverse events were reported.\n\nInterpretation: Temporary biventricular pacing reduces VIS in the early postoperative period. Further research is needed to explore its impact on arrhythmogenesis, morbidity, mortality, and hospital costs.\n\nTrial registration: Not provided.\n\nFunding: Not specified.",
