A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Femoral Head Size in Total Hip Arthroplasty\n\nBackground: Larger femoral heads are thought to improve joint stability and hip biomechanics, potentially accelerating the recovery of normal gait. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of different femoral head sizes on gait parameters and hip function in total hip arthroplasty (THA).\n\nMethods: This randomised, blinded trial included 60 female patients aged 55-70 years with primary hip arthritis, conducted at a single orthopedic center. Participants were randomised into three groups of 20 to receive a 28-mm, 36-mm ceramic-on-crosslinked polyethylene, or ≥42-mm metal-on-metal bearing couple. Randomisation was computer-generated, and allocation was concealed. Blinding included patients, clinicians, and outcome assessors. Gait analysis using an optoelectronic system was performed preoperatively and at 2 and 4 months postoperatively. The primary outcome was spatiotemporal gait parameters at 4 months, with secondary outcomes including kinematic and kinetic parameters and Harris hip scores.\n\nResults: All groups demonstrated improvements in spatiotemporal, kinematic, and kinetic gait parameters, as well as Harris hip scores at 4 months, with no significant differences among groups. The mean difference in spatiotemporal parameters was not significant (p > 0.05). No adverse events were reported, indicating the safety of all interventions.\n\nInterpretation: The hypothesis that larger femoral heads would result in improved early gait performance was not supported. The findings suggest that femoral head size does not significantly influence early postoperative gait recovery in THA. The study was registered under trial number [Trial Registration Number]. Funding was provided by [Funding Source]. Further research may explore long-term outcomes and other patient populations.",
