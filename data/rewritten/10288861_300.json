A 300-word version\n\nTitle: A Randomised Controlled Trial of Neoadjuvant Atezolizumab in Resectable Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer\n\nBackground: Multimodality treatment for resectable non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has reached a therapeutic plateau. This trial evaluates the safety and efficacy of neoadjuvant atezolizumab in resectable NSCLC.\n\nMethods: This phase II multicenter single-arm study enrolled patients with stage IB to select IIIB resectable NSCLC and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 0/1. Participants received atezolizumab 1200 mg intravenously every 3 weeks for 2 cycles, followed by surgical resection. The primary outcome was major pathological response (MPR) in patients without EGFR/ALK alterations, assessed approximately 30 days post-surgery. Adverse events were recorded using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v.4.0.\n\nResults: From April 2017 to February 2020, 181 patients were enrolled. In the primary efficacy population (n=143), the MPR rate was 20% (29/143; 95% CI, 14-28), and the pathological complete response rate was 6% (8/143; 95% CI, 2-11). Of 159 patients undergoing surgery, 145 (91%) achieved pathologic complete resection. There were 5 intraoperative complications and 2 postoperative deaths within 90 days, 1 treatment-related. No grade 4/5 treatment-related adverse events occurred preoperatively. Median disease-free and overall survival have not been reached. The study demonstrated that neoadjuvant atezolizumab was associated with low morbidity and mortality, with a median hospital stay of 7.5 days. The trial also highlighted the discrepancy between radiological response and final pathological stage after neoadjuvant therapy.\n\nInterpretation: Neoadjuvant atezolizumab in resectable stage IB to IIIB NSCLC was well tolerated, yielding a 20% MPR rate and allowing safe, complete surgical resection. These findings support further development of immune checkpoint inhibitors as preoperative therapy in locally advanced NSCLC. The results suggest potential for improved patient selection and highlight the need for further studies to identify patients who may benefit from monotherapy.\n\nTrial registration: Not provided.\n\nFunding: Not specified.",
