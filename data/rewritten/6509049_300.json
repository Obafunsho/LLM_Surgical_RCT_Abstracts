A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Hyperinsulinemic Normoglycemia in Cardiac Surgery\n\nBackground: Hyperinsulinemic normoglycemia is hypothesized to enhance myocardial glucose uptake and utilization, potentially reducing 30-day mortality and morbidity following cardiac surgery.\n\nMethods: This dual-center, parallel-group, superiority trial was conducted at the Cleveland Clinic and Royal Victoria Hospital from August 2007 to March 2015. Eligible cardiac surgical patients were randomized to intraoperative glycemic management with either hyperinsulinemic normoglycemia (fixed high-dose insulin and variable glucose infusion targeting 80–110 mg·dL−1) or standard glycemic management (low-dose insulin targeting glucose >150 mg·dL−1). The primary outcome was a composite of 30-day mortality, mechanical circulatory support, infection, renal or neurologic morbidity. Randomization was computer-generated with allocation concealment. Blinding details were not specified.\n\nResults: A total of 1,439 patients were randomized (709 to hyperinsulinemic normoglycemia, 730 to standard management). The analysis followed an intention-to-treat approach. The primary outcome occurred in 49 (6.9%) patients in the hyperinsulinemic group compared to 82 (11.2%) in the standard group (P<0.0085); relative risk 0.62 (95% CI 0.39, 0.97), P=0.0043. Severe hypoglycemia (<40 mg·dL−1) was observed in 6 (0.9%) patients. A treatment-by-site interaction was identified, with a relative risk of 0.49 (95% CI 0.26, 0.91, P=0.0007) at Royal Victoria Hospital and 0.96 (95% CI 0.41, 2.24, P=0.89) at the Cleveland Clinic.\n\nInterpretation: Intraoperative hyperinsulinemic normoglycemia significantly reduced mortality and morbidity after cardiac surgery. Providing exogenous glucose while targeting normoglycemia may be more effective than simply normalizing glucose concentrations. Trial registration: [Number]. Funding: [Source].",
