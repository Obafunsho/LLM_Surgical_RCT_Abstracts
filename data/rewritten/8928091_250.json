Participants were randomised 1:1 to E-SPN (day 3) or L-SPN (day 8) groups. Randomisation used a permuted block design with allocation concealment via sealed envelopes. Outcome assessors were blinded. The primary outcome was the incidence of nosocomial infections from postoperative day 3 to discharge.\n\nResults: Of 230 randomised, 229 were analysed (115 E-SPN, 114 L-SPN) using intention-to-treat. E-SPN significantly reduced nosocomial infections (8.7% vs 18.4%; risk difference, 9.7%; 95% CI, 0.9%-18.5%; P = 0.04). No significant differences in noninfectious complications or adverse events were observed. Therapeutic antibiotic days were fewer in the E-SPN group (mean difference, 1.0 days; 95% CI, 0.2-1.9; P = 0.01).\n\nInterpretation: E-SPN reduced nosocomial infections in high-risk patients post-abdominal surgery.
