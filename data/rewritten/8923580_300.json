A 300-word version\n\nTitle: A Randomised Controlled Trial of US-Guided Steroid Injections in de Quervain Disease\n\nBackground: This randomised controlled trial evaluated the effectiveness and safety of US-guided steroid injections targeting the extensor pollicis brevis (EPB) subcompartment alone compared to injections targeting both the EPB and abductor pollicis longus (APL) subcompartments in patients with de Quervain disease.\n\nMethods: Conducted at a single center from August 2018 to March 2021, 50 patients with de Quervain disease and complete intracompartmental septum were randomised to receive US-guided injections in both subcompartments (n = 25) or the EPB subcompartment alone (n = 25). The primary outcome was pain reduction measured by VAS score at 6 weeks. Randomisation was computer-generated, and allocation was concealed. Outcome assessors were blinded. A sample size of 21 per group was calculated to provide 80% power to detect a clinically important difference of 20 mm in VAS score.\n\nResults: At 6 weeks, no significant difference in VAS scores was observed between groups (mean difference -0.08, 95% CI -4.08 to 3.91; p = 0.97). At 12 weeks, results were similar (mean difference 0.38, 95% CI -7.74 to 8.49; p = 0.09). No adverse events such as tendon rupture or infections occurred. Skin hypopigmentation was less frequent in the EPB group (33% vs. 67%; odds ratio 0.25, 95% CI 0.08 to 0.83; p = 0.02).\n\nInterpretation: US-guided steroid injection targeting the EPB subcompartment alone is as effective as targeting both subcompartments for pain reduction and may reduce steroid-related complications.
