A torsion adapter may enhance transverse plane compliance and reduce torque on the residual limb, potentially improving mobility, pain, and fatigue.\n\nMethods: In this randomised controlled trial, 10 unilateral transtibial amputees were randomly assigned to wear either a torsion or rigid adapter in a crossover design. Functional mobility was assessed using an activity monitor and a 6-minute walk test with turns. Self-perceived pain was measured using the residual limb pain grade, and fatigue was assessed with the Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory.\n\nResults: Participants wearing a torsion adapter took more low- and medium-intensity steps per day (331 ± 365 and 437 ± 511 difference in steps; effect size = 0.44 and 0.17; CI, 70–592 and 71–802; p = 0.019 and 0.024, respectively) and reported less pain interference (1.9 ± 1.7 change in score; effect size = 0.83; CI, 0.3–3.4; p = 0.026). Total steps per day, distance walked in 6 minutes, and residual limb pain and fatigue were similar between groups.\n\nInterpretation: The torsion adapter did not lead to substantial improvements in functional mobility or self-perceived pain and fatigue. However, the small increases in low- and medium-intensity activities and reduced pain interference suggest potential benefits for amputees facing challenges in household and community environments.\n\nTrial registration: [Trial registration number]\n\nFunding: [Source of funding]",
