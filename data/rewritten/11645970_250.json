A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of High-Dose Magnesium Sulfate Infusion for Opioid-Sparing Analgesia in Pediatric Transplant Recipients\n\nBackground: The opioid crisis necessitates opioid-sparing analgesics. This trial assessed the feasibility of high-dose magnesium sulfate (MgSO4) infusion for analgesia in pediatric transplant recipients.\n\nMethods: This prospective trial with a retrospective control group was conducted at the University of Minnesota. Participants aged 3–18 years undergoing total pancreatectomy with islet cell autotransplantation or liver transplantation were included. Exclusions were pregnancy, neuromuscular disease, hypersensitivity, preoperative creatinine >1.5 times upper limit normal, arrhythmia, or pacemaker presence. Eleven patients were enrolled from July 2020 to December 2022. The intervention included a MgSO4 bolus (50 mg/kg) followed by an infusion (15 mg/kg/h) for up to 48 hours. The primary outcome was oral morphine equivalent (OME) per kg per day during the PICU stay. Secondary outcomes included safety measures. Randomisation and blinding details were not applicable.\n\nResults: The treatment group showed a trend towards higher intravenous fluid requirement (~1 bolus) but no increase in blood product use. No serious adverse events were reported. The study was not powered to detect efficacy.\n\nInterpretation: High-dose MgSO4 infusion is feasible for opioid-sparing analgesia in pediatric transplant recipients. Further studies are needed to assess efficacy.\n\nTrial registration: NCT04812028\n\nFunding: University of Minnesota Department of Pediatrics.",
