A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Cost-Effectiveness of Dual Hypothermic Oxygenated Machine Perfusion in DCD Liver Transplantation: A Randomised Controlled Trial\n\nBackground: This study evaluates the cost-effectiveness of dual hypothermic oxygenated machine perfusion (DHOPE) compared to static cold storage (SCS) in donation after circulatory death (DCD) liver transplantation.\n\nMethods: In a multicenter randomised controlled trial (DHOPE-DCD trial; ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT02584283), patients were randomised to receive a DCD liver preserved with either DHOPE or SCS. The trial was conducted in three Dutch liver transplant centers. The primary outcome was the cost-effectiveness of DHOPE, measured by total medical costs up to one year posttransplant. Randomisation was computer-generated, and allocation was concealed. Patients and organ procurement teams were blinded to group allocation. Costs were calculated using three scenarios: (1) machine perfusion costs, (2) machine perfusion plus personnel costs, and (3) scenario 2 plus depreciation for a dedicated organ perfusion room.\n\nResults: A total of 119 patients were randomised: 60 to DHOPE and 59 to SCS. The mean total cost per patient was €110,794 for DHOPE and €126,221 for SCS, with significant reductions in intensive care costs (28.4%) and nonsurgical interventions (24.3%). DHOPE was cost-effective after one procedure in scenario 1, and after 25 and 30 procedures per year in scenarios 2 and 3, respectively.\n\nInterpretation: DHOPE is cost-effective in DCD liver transplantation, reducing total medical costs up to one year posttransplant. No adverse events were reported. The study was funded by national healthcare bodies.",
