A 250-word version\n\nTitle: A Randomised Controlled Trial of Morphine and Mexiletine for Postamputation Pain\n\nBackground: Stump and phantom pains are debilitating sequelae of amputations, often resistant to treatment. The efficacy of pharmacologic therapies, including opioids and sodium channel blockers, for postamputation pain is uncertain.\n\nMethods: This double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled, crossover trial was conducted in adult patients with postamputation pain of 6 months or longer and greater than 3 on a 0–10 numeric pain rating scale. Participants were randomised to receive morphine, mexiletine, or placebo, with each treatment period including a 1-week drug-free interval, 4-week titration, 2-week maintenance, and 2-week drug-taper phases. The primary outcome was the change in average pain intensity from the drug-free baseline to the last week of maintenance. Randomisation was computer-generated, and allocation was concealed. Patients, clinicians, and outcome assessors were blinded.\n\nResults: Sixty amputees were randomised; data were analysed from 56 subjects for one drug period, 45 for two, and 35 who completed all three. Morphine treatment resulted in lower pain scores compared with placebo and mexiletine (P = 0.0003). The mean percent pain relief was 19% for placebo, 30% for mexiletine, and 53% for morphine (P < 0.0001, morphine vs. placebo and mexiletine). Morphine was associated with a higher rate of side effects.\n\nInterpretation: Morphine, but not mexiletine, significantly reduced postamputation pain intensity but was associated with more side effects. No improvement in self-reported functional activity and pain-related interference was observed. Trial registration: [Trial registration number]. Funding: [Source of funding].",
