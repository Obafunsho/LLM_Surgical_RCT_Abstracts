This study evaluates the effect of abaloparatide on BMD in proximal femoral regions.\n\nMethods: This Phase-3, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial included 500 postmenopausal women with osteoporosis from the ACTIVE trial. Participants were randomly assigned to receive abaloparatide (n=250) or placebo (n=250) for 18 months. Randomisation was stratified by study site and race/ethnicity, with allocation concealed. Blinding included patients, clinicians, and outcome assessors. The primary outcome was the change in integral volumetric BMD in Gruen zones over 18 months. Analysis was intention-to-treat.\n\nResults: At 6 and 18 months, the abaloparatide group showed greater increases in integral volumetric BMD in all zones compared to placebo (p<0.005). Cortical surface BMD increased in zones 1, 6, and 7 at month 6 (p<0.005) and in all zones at month 18 (p<0.0001). Cortical thickness and trabecular volumetric BMD in zones 1 and 7 also increased significantly at both time points (p<0.0001). No serious adverse events were reported.\n\nInterpretation: Abaloparatide significantly increases BMD in proximal femoral regions, suggesting potential value for preoperative bone health optimization in THA candidates. These findings may inform strategies to reduce complications associated with low BMD in THA.\n\nTrial registration: NCT01343004\n\nFunding: Not specified.",
