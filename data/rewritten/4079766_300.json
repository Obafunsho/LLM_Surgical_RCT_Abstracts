A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Bypass Angioplasty Revascularization Investigation 2 Diabetes (BARI 2D): A Randomised Controlled Trial\n\nBackground: The BARI 2D trial assessed management strategies for diabetic patients with myocardial ischemia and coronary artery disease, focusing on early revascularization versus medical management and insulin sensitization versus insulin provision.\n\nMethods: This multicenter randomised controlled trial employed a 2 × 2 factorial design. Eligible participants were diabetic patients with myocardial ischemia and multivessel coronary artery disease. Randomisation was conducted using a computer-generated sequence, with allocation concealment ensured. Due to the nature of the interventions, blinding was not feasible. The primary outcome was the incidence of subsequent myocardial infarction, assessed over a specified follow-up period. A total of 347 patients were randomised to either early coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) or medical management. The analysis followed an intention-to-treat approach.\n\nResults: Of the 347 patients, 173 were allocated to early CABG and 174 to medical management. Early CABG was associated with a significant reduction in myocardial infarction rates compared to medical management (hazard ratio = 0.70, 95% CI 0.50 to 0.98; p = 0.04). The perioperative morbidity and mortality rates were low, and adverse events were comparable between the groups, with no significant differences observed.\n\nInterpretation: The BARI 2D trial demonstrated that early CABG in diabetic patients with myocardial ischemia and multivessel disease significantly reduced myocardial infarction rates. These results highlight the benefit of early surgical intervention in this patient population. Trial registration: NCT00006305. Funding: The study was funded by the National Institutes of Health, ensuring comprehensive support for the trial's execution and analysis.",
