A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Balloon Dilation vs. Hydrostatic Dilation for Arteriovenous Fistula in Chronic Renal Failure Patients\n\nBackground: This randomised controlled trial aimed to compare the efficacy of balloon dilation (BD) versus hydrostatic dilation (HD) in establishing radio-cephalic arteriovenous fistulas in patients with chronic renal failure and small veins.\n\nMethods: Conducted at Shanxi Bethune Hospital, patients with cephalic vein diameters <2 mm were randomly assigned to BD or HD groups. Randomisation was performed using a computer-generated sequence, and allocation was concealed using sealed envelopes. The primary outcome was the 1-year primary patency rate. Secondary outcomes included blood flow and vein diameter, measured over 1 year. Blinding was not applied.\n\nResults: Forty-two patients were randomised: 22 to BD and 20 to HD, recruited from August 1, 2018, to September 1, 2021. Analysis was per-protocol. The 1-year primary patency rate was 61.9% for BD and 11.1% for HD (p = 0.045). Secondary patency rates were 90.5% for BD and 55.6% for HD (p = 0.030). Functional primary patency was 57.1% for BD and 16.7% for HD (p = 0.032). No adverse events were reported.\n\nInterpretation: BD significantly improved patency and blood flow compared to HD in patients with small veins. This suggests BD is a superior method for establishing arteriovenous fistulas in this population.\n\nTrial registration: Not provided.\n\nFunding: Not reported.",
