A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Intravenous Magnesium in Remifentanil-Based Anesthesia\n\nBackground: Remifentanil-based anesthesia is linked to opioid-induced hyperalgesia (OIH), increasing postoperative pain and analgesic requirements. This study assesses whether intravenous magnesium, an NMDA receptor antagonist, can reduce postoperative pain and analgesic needs in adults receiving remifentanil-based anesthesia.\n\nMethods: We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing intravenous magnesium to placebo. The primary outcomes were postoperative analgesic requirements and pain scores within 24 hours. Secondary outcomes included intraoperative remifentanil consumption, shivering, postoperative nausea/vomiting (PONV), extubation time, hypotension, and bradycardia. Risk of bias was evaluated using the Cochrane RoB 2 tool, and evidence quality was assessed with GRADE. The study was registered on PROSPERO (CRD42024609911).\n\nResults: Twenty-two RCTs involving 1362 participants were included. Magnesium significantly decreased 24-hour analgesic requirements (SMD −1.51; 95% CI −2.15 to −0.87; p < 0.0001) and pain scores (SMD −0.61; 95% CI −0.90 to −0.32; p < 0.0001), with benefits persisting up to 48 hours. It also reduced intraoperative remifentanil use (SMD −0.52), shivering (OR 0.25), and PONV (OR 0.66), without prolonging extubation or increasing hypotension/bradycardia risk. High heterogeneity and potential publication bias were observed. Adverse events were not significantly different between groups.\n\nInterpretation: Intravenous magnesium appears beneficial in reducing postoperative pain and analgesic requirements in remifentanil-based anesthesia. However, the evidence quality—rated moderate to very low—along with high heterogeneity and potential publication bias, calls for caution. Further large-scale, methodologically robust trials are needed to confirm optimal dosing and clarify safety profiles across diverse surgical populations. The study was funded by institutional grants.",
