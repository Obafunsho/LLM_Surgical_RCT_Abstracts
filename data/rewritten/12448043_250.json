A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of ROTEM®-Guided Transfusion Strategy in Obstetric Haemorrhage\n\nBackground: This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of a ROTEM®-guided transfusion strategy compared to conventional transfusion methods in managing postpartum haemorrhage (PPH) ≥1500 ml.\n\nMethods: Conducted at the Rotunda Hospital, Dublin, this trial included 944 women experiencing PPH ≥1500 ml over five years. Participants were retrospectively analysed, with 238 women in the post-ROTEM® group and 706 in the pre-ROTEM® group. The primary outcome was the overall consumption of blood coagulation products, measured over one year post-implementation. Randomisation and blinding details are not applicable as this was a retrospective analysis.\n\nResults: The post-ROTEM® group showed a 46% reduction in fibrinogen concentrate use, a 72% decrease in Octaplas®, and a 79% reduction in platelet use, resulting in a cost saving of €51,738. Compliance with evidence-based fibrinogen transfusion triggers improved from 23% to 84%. No significant difference was observed in progression to severe haemorrhage (≥2000 ml) between groups (40% vs. 44%, p=0.35). No adverse events were reported.\n\nInterpretation: The ROTEM®-guided strategy, supported by an electronic decision tool and staff training, enhanced adherence to evidence-based practice, reduced unnecessary coagulation product use, and generated substantial cost savings without adversely affecting clinical outcomes. These findings may inform institutions seeking to optimise transfusion strategies in obstetric haemorrhage.\n\nTrial registration: Not applicable.\n\nFunding: Not specified.",
