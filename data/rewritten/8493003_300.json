A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Preoperative Breast MRI in Breast Cancer: A Randomised Controlled Trial\n\nBackground: The role of preoperative breast MRI in improving disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) in breast cancer patients is debated. This study investigates the long-term effects of preoperative MRI compared to conventional imaging.\n\nMethods: This randomised multicentre trial involved 440 patients aged 56 years or less with newly diagnosed breast cancer, conducted at three breast cancer units. Participants were randomised to receive preoperative MRI (n=220) or conventional imaging (n=220) between 2007 and 2010. The primary outcome was DFS, assessed over a 10-year follow-up. Randomisation was computer-generated, with allocation concealment. Blinding was not applicable.\n\nResults: After 10 years, DFS rates were 85.5% in the MRI group and 80.0% in the control group (HR 1.46, 95% CI 0.93 to 2.29; P=0.099). OS rates were 90.9% for MRI and 88.6% for control (HR 1.27, 95% CI 0.71 to 2.29; P=0.427). Combined locoregional, distant, and contralateral recurrence outcomes were higher in the control group (P=0.048). Subgroup analysis for stages I–III showed improved DFS with MRI, but this did not reach statistical significance (P=0.057). No adverse events were reported.\n\nInterpretation: Preoperative breast MRI as an adjunct to conventional imaging resulted in slightly improved DFS and OS, though not statistically significant, after 10 years. The findings suggest potential benefits of MRI in surgical planning and long-term outcomes, warranting further investigation.\n\nTrial registration: NCT01859936\n\nFunding: Supported by Capio St Goran’s Hospital Research Foundation, Centre for Clinical Research, Vastmanland Hospital, Percy Falk Foundation, and Vastmanland Research Foundation against Cancer.",
