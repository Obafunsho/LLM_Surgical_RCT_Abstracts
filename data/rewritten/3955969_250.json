A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial on the Impact of Intraoperative Cerebral Desaturation on Postoperative Outcomes in Non-Cardiac Surgery\n\nBackground: Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) is used to monitor regional cerebral oxygenation (rScO2) during cardiac surgery but is less established during non-cardiac surgery. This study aimed to determine the non-cardiac surgical procedures that provoke a reduction in rScO2 and evaluate whether an intraoperative reduction in rScO2 influences postoperative outcomes.\n\nMethods: A systematic review of 113 articles was conducted, focusing on adult patients undergoing non-cardiac surgery with intraoperative NIRS-determined rScO2. The study included thoracic, major abdominal, hip, laparoscopic, shoulder arthroscopy, and carotid endarterectomy surgeries. The primary outcome was the occurrence of postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) related to intraoperative cerebral desaturation.\n\nResults: Evidence suggests that rScO2 is reduced during thoracic surgery involving single lung ventilation, major abdominal surgery, hip surgery, and laparoscopic surgery with the patient in anti-Trendelenburg's position. Shoulder arthroscopy in the beach chair and carotid endarterectomy with clamped internal carotid artery (ICA) also cause pronounced cerebral desaturation. A >20% reduction in rScO2 coincides with indices of regional and global cerebral ischemia during carotid endarterectomy. Following thoracic, major orthopedic, and abdominal surgery, the occurrence of POCD might be related to intraoperative cerebral desaturation.\n\nInterpretation: Certain non-cardiac surgical procedures are associated with an increased risk for the occurrence of rScO2 reduction. Evidence for an association between cerebral desaturation and postoperative outcome parameters other than cognitive dysfunction needs to be established.",
