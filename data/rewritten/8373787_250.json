A 250-word version\n\nTitle: A Randomised Controlled Trial of Surgical vs. Medical Treatment for Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: Long-term Patient Reported Outcomes\n\nBackground: The STAMPEDE trial aimed to investigate the long-term effects of surgical and medical treatments on patient-reported outcomes (PROs) in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients with obesity.\n\nMethods: This randomised controlled trial included 104 participants from the STAMPEDE trial, who were administered RAND-36, EQ-5D-3L, and a diabetes-specific instrument at baseline and annually for 5 years. Participants were randomised to Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB), sleeve gastrectomy (SG), or intensive medical therapy (IMT). Randomisation was computer-generated, and allocation was concealed. Blinding was not specified.\n\nResults: 104 participants were randomised: 35 to RYGB, 35 to SG, and 34 to IMT. Analysis was conducted on all participants using an intention-to-treat approach. RYGB and SG significantly improved physical functioning, general health perception, energy/fatigue, and diabetes-related QoL compared to IMT. No significant differences were observed in psychological and social QoL aspects. Independent factors for improved general health included baseline health, insulin independence, RYGB, and SG. No significant adverse events were reported.\n\nInterpretation: Metabolic surgery, particularly RYGB and SG, is associated with long-term improvements in physical health and diabetes-related PROs compared to IMT in T2DM patients. Psychosocial well-being requires further attention post-surgery.\n\nTrial registration: [Trial registration number]\n\nFunding: [Source of funding]",
