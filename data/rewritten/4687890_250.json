A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Mitral Valve Repair vs. Replacement for Severe Ischemic Mitral Regurgitation\n\nBackground: The Cardiothoracic Surgical Trials Network conducted a randomised controlled trial to compare mitral valve repair and replacement in patients with severe ischemic mitral regurgitation, focusing on left ventricular end-systolic volume index at 1 year post-surgery.\n\nMethods: This study included 251 patients, randomised to repair (n = 126) or replacement (n = 125). Eligibility criteria included severe ischemic mitral regurgitation, and the study was conducted across multiple cardiothoracic centers. Randomisation was computer-generated, with allocation concealment ensured. Blinding was not applicable due to the nature of the interventions. The primary outcome was the recurrence of moderate/severe mitral regurgitation or death within 2 years.\n\nResults: Of the 116 patients who received repair, 76 developed moderate/severe mitral regurgitation or died. The model, incorporating baseline echocardiographic and clinical characteristics, showed an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.82. Adverse events were not detailed in the abstract.\n\nInterpretation: The model effectively identified patients at risk of recurrence or death post-repair, offering a potential risk score for surgical candidate selection. Further validation is required.\n\nTrial registration: [Trial registration number]\n\nFunding: [Source of funding]",
