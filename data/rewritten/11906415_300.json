A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Hyperthermia as an Adjunct to Immunotherapy in Cancer Treatment\n\nBackground: Immunotherapies have revolutionized cancer treatment by leveraging the immune system to target malignancies. Hyperthermia (HT) has re-emerged as a promising adjunctive treatment, capable of enhancing the effectiveness of radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and immunotherapy.\n\nMethods: This randomised controlled trial aimed to assess the impact of HT on immune response and tumor microenvironment modulation. Participants with resistant tumors were recruited from a single oncology center. Eligibility criteria included patients with advanced-stage cancer unresponsive to standard therapies. The intervention group received HT combined with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), while the control group received ICIs alone. Randomisation was conducted using a computer-generated sequence with allocation concealment. Outcome assessors were blinded to group assignments.\n\nResults: A total of 200 participants were randomised, with 100 assigned to each group, between January 2020 and June 2021. The primary outcome was the transformation of \"cold\" tumors into \"hot\" tumors, assessed over a six-month period. In the intervention group, 98 participants were analysed using an intention-to-treat approach, demonstrating a significant increase in immune cell infiltration and antigen presentation (mean difference = 5.2, 95% CI 3.1 to 7.3; p = 0.01). Adverse events were mild, with 3% in the intervention group and 1% in the control group experiencing gastrointestinal side-effects.\n\nInterpretation: HT significantly enhances the efficacy of ICIs by modulating the tumor microenvironment and promoting immune-mediated tumor destruction. These findings suggest that HT can transform immunologically \"cold\" tumors into \"hot\" ones, making them more susceptible to immune-mediated destruction. Further research is needed to optimize treatment protocols, explore the differential impacts of local versus whole-body hyperthermia, and identify biomarkers for patient stratification.\n\nTrial registration: NCT12345678\n\nFunding: This trial was funded by the National Cancer Institute.",
