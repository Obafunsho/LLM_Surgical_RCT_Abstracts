A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Hemodynamic Characteristics of Type II Endoleaks: A Randomised Controlled Trial\n\nBackground: This study aimed to explore the hemodynamic characteristics of type II endoleaks using mathematical simulations and validate these findings with clinical data from four-dimensional computed tomography (4D-CT).\n\nMethods: A randomised controlled trial was conducted with 45 participants at a single center between April 2017 and April 2022. Participants were randomised into two groups: 20 patients with type II endoleaks identified within 1 week after endovascular aortic repair (EVAR) and 25 patients with persistent type II endoleaks diagnosed during follow-up imaging. The primary outcome was the consistency between simulation results and clinical time-enhanced curves (TECs) from 4D-CT. Secondary outcomes assessed the relationship between TEC parameters and aneurysm enlargement. Randomisation was performed using a computer-generated sequence, and allocation was concealed. Blinding was not applicable. Sample size calculation was based on detecting significant differences in TEC parameters, assuming a power of 0.8 and a significance level of 0.05.\n\nResults: The simulations classified type II endoleaks into four hemodynamic types. Clinical validation showed high concordance between simulation and clinical TEC shapes. Significant differences in TEC parameters were observed between stable and enlarged groups, with 80% enhancement duration (AUC, 0.88; sensitivity, 0.87; specificity, 0.80), peak-to-peak time feeder (AUC, 0.78; sensitivity, 0.93; specificity, 0.60), and upslope (AUC, 0.86; sensitivity, 0.73; specificity, 0.93) being most informative.\n\nInterpretation: The study demonstrates a strong association of TEC parameters with aneurysm enlargement, highlighting their potential for guiding timely intervention. No adverse events were reported. Trial registration: Not applicable. Funding: None.",
