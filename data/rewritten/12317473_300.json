This study aimed to explore the association between preoperative platelet count and the risk of postoperative AKI in patients undergoing abdominal surgery.\n\nMethods: This retrospective cohort study analyzed data from the INformative Surgical Patient dataset for Innovative Research Environment (INSPIRE) database, which includes patients who underwent abdominal surgery at Seoul National University Hospital from 2011 to 2020. Logistic regression and restricted cubic spline analyses were used to evaluate the relationship between preoperative platelet count and the risk of developing AKI.\n\nResults: The study included 7,131 patients. A significant negative association was observed between preoperative platelet counts and postoperative AKI risk across all models (P for trend < 0.001 in unadjusted and partially adjusted models, 0.002 in fully adjusted model). Multivariable-adjusted restricted cubic spline analysis confirmed a significant inverse relationship between preoperative platelet count and the risk of postoperative AKI. The probability of developing AKI after abdominal surgery increased significantly when preoperative platelet counts were below 220 × 10⁹/L.\n\nInterpretation: Lower preoperative platelet counts are associated with an increased risk of postoperative AKI in patients undergoing abdominal surgery. Preoperative platelet count may serve as a useful indicator for predicting AKI risk in this population. These findings suggest that monitoring preoperative platelet counts could help identify patients at higher risk for postoperative AKI, allowing for targeted preventive strategies.",
