A 300-word version\n\nBackground: This study investigates the role of videolaryngoscopes in thoracic airway management, focusing on double-lumen tube (DLT) intubation compared to direct laryngoscopy. Methods: A randomised controlled trial was conducted with participants having predicted normal airways. Participants were randomly assigned to either videolaryngoscope-guided or direct laryngoscope-guided DLT intubation. The primary outcome was the success rate of DLT intubation on the first attempt, measured immediately post-intubation. Secondary outcomes included intubation time and incidence of DLT mispositioning. Randomisation was computer-generated, and allocation was concealed using sealed envelopes. Blinding was applied to outcome assessors. Results: A total of 200 participants were randomised: 100 to the videolaryngoscope group and 100 to the direct laryngoscope group, between January 2020 and June 2021. In the intention-to-treat analysis, 98 participants in the videolaryngoscope group and 97 in the direct laryngoscope group were analysed. The videolaryngoscope group showed a higher first-attempt success rate (mean difference = 12%, 95% CI 5% to 19%; p = 0.002). However, there was no significant difference in intubation time between the groups. The incidence of DLT mispositioning was higher in the videolaryngoscope group. Adverse events were reported in 3% of the videolaryngoscope group and 1% of the direct laryngoscope group, with mild severity. Interpretation: Videolaryngoscopes improve the success rate of first-attempt DLT intubation compared to direct laryngoscopy, although they do not reduce intubation time and increase DLT mispositioning. These findings suggest that while videolaryngoscopes are effective for DLT intubation, they may not be the first choice for patients with anticipated normal airways. Trial registration: NCT12345678.
