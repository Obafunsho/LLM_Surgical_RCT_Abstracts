A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of CYP2C19 Metabolizer Phenotype and POAF Incidence after OPCABG\n\nBackground: This study investigates the association between CYP2C19 metabolizer phenotype and the incidence of postoperative atrial fibrillation (POAF) in patients undergoing off-pump coronary artery bypass graft (OPCABG) surgery with clopidogrel-based dual antiplatelet therapy.\n\nMethods: A retrospective cohort study was conducted at Sichuan Provincial People’s Hospital, involving 320 patients undergoing elective first-time OPCABG from May 2017 to November 2023. Patients were categorized into normal metabolizer (NM), intermediate metabolizer (IM), and poor metabolizer (PM) groups based on CYP2C19 genotyping. The primary outcome was the incidence of POAF within the first week post-surgery. Secondary outcomes included platelet aggregability, inflammatory indexes, and prothrombotic effect. \n\nResults: POAF incidence was 20.9% in the NM group, 35.7% in the IM group (HR 1.843, 95% CI 1.155 to 2.940; P = 0.0076), and 57.8% in the PM group (HR 3.363, 95% CI 1.753 to 6.499; P < 0.0001). ADP-stimulated platelet aggregation, inflammatory cytokines, and prothrombotic effect were significantly higher in the IM and PM groups compared to the NM group.\n\nInterpretation: The CYP2C19 metabolizer phenotype is associated with differential POAF incidence and burden, suggesting the need for personalized antiplatelet therapy in OPCABG patients. No adverse events were reported. The study was approved by the Medical Ethical Review Board of Sichuan Provincial People’s Hospital (approval no. 2021215). Funding sources were not disclosed.",
