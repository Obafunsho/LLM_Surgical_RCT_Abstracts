A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Gastrointestinal Motility Agents in Elective Colorectal Surgery\n\nBackground: Postoperative ileus (POI) is a common complication after elective colorectal surgery, delaying gastrointestinal (GI) recovery. This study evaluates the efficacy and safety of GI motility agents in this context.\n\nMethods: A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) was conducted. Seven RCTs involving 849 patients were included. Participants were adults undergoing elective colorectal surgery. Interventions included prokinetics and laxatives, compared to placebo or standard ERAS care. The primary outcome was GI-2 recovery, defined as tolerance of solid diet and stool passage, measured within the first postoperative week. Randomisation and allocation concealment methods varied across studies. Blinding was implemented for patients and outcome assessors.\n\nResults: GI motility agents significantly accelerated GI-2 recovery (mean difference –1.01 days; 95% CI –1.29 to –0.73; p < 0.001) and reduced time to first defaecation (mean difference –1.07 days; 95% CI –1.40 to –0.73; p < 0.001). No significant differences were observed in safety outcomes, including anastomotic leak (OR 0.97; 95% CI 0.53 to 1.77), nasogastric tube reinsertion (OR 0.86; 95% CI 0.49 to 1.51), or readmission rates (OR 1.03; 95% CI 0.62 to 1.72).\n\nInterpretation: GI motility agents enhance postoperative GI recovery without compromising safety. Given their low cost and availability, they may be integrated into ERAS protocols. Trial registration: PROSPERO CRD420250655358. Funding: Not specified.",
