A 300-word version\n\nTitle: A Randomised Controlled Trial of a Flipped Classroom Model in Nursing Education\n\nBackground: This study investigates the effect of a digitally enhanced flipped classroom model on the self-perceived competence of Bulgarian nursing and midwifery students.\n\nMethods: A total of 228 participants were randomised into a control group receiving traditional instruction and an experimental group engaged in a digitally enhanced preparatory phase. The intervention included pre-class video algorithms, virtual reality (VR), and clinical problem-solving tasks. A 25-item self-report questionnaire measured perceived competence in injection techniques, hygiene care, midwifery skills, and digital readiness before and after the intervention. Randomisation was conducted using a computer-generated sequence, and allocation was concealed using sealed envelopes. Blinding was not applied. The study was conducted at the University of Ruse, Bulgaria, with eligibility criteria including enrollment in the nursing or midwifery program.\n\nResults: Statistical analysis using Welch’s t-test revealed significant improvements in the experimental group across all domains (p < 0.001). Qualitative data from focus group interviews confirmed increased student engagement, motivation, and receptiveness to digital learning tools. No adverse events were reported. The primary outcome was measured over a semester-long timeframe.\n\nInterpretation: The findings highlight the pedagogical value of integrating structured video learning, VR components, and case-based learning within flipped classrooms. The study advocates for the wider adoption of blended learning models to foster clinical confidence and digital competence in healthcare education. The results may inform curriculum developers aiming to improve clinical readiness through technology-enhanced learning. The study underscores the potential of digital transformation in nursing education, even in resource-limited settings.\n\nTrial registration: Not provided.\n\nFunding: Not specified.",
