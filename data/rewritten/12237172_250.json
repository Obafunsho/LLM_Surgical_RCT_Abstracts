This study compares the cuff inflation-deflation technique with the conventional method for NTI.\n\nMethods: This prospective, randomised controlled trial was conducted in a surgical setting. Participants were 106 patients aged 18-65 years, ASA I-II, scheduled for elective surgeries requiring NTI. Patients were randomly allocated to either the conventional group (Group C) or the cuff inflation group (Group I) using block randomisation. The primary outcome was intubation time, measured from oropharynx entry to successful end-tidal CO2 confirmation. Secondary outcomes included the number of maneuvers, hemodynamic responses, and complications. Randomisation was concealed using opaque envelopes. Blinding was not possible for the anesthesiologists.\n\nResults: 53 patients were randomised to each group. Intubation time was significantly shorter in Group I (27.86 ± 4.47 s) compared to Group C (41.11 ± 10.98 s; P < 0.0001). Group I required fewer maneuvers (13/53) than Group C (28/53; P = 0.00277). Hemodynamic parameters were more stable in Group I. Mild to moderate nasal bleeding occurred in 5/53 patients in Group I and 8/53 in Group C. No severe complications were reported.\n\nInterpretation: The cuff inflation-deflation technique reduces intubation time, hemodynamic stress, and maneuver requirements compared to the conventional method.
