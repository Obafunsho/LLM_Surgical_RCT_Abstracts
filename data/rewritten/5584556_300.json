A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial on KRAS Mutations and Rectal Cancer Response to Chemoradiation Therapy\n\nBackground: KRAS and TP53 mutations are common in colorectal cancer and associated with resistance to therapy. This study aimed to establish a correlation between specific KRAS mutations and rectal cancer response to neoadjuvant chemoradiation therapy (CRT), and investigate the association with TP53 mutations.\n\nMethods: This randomised controlled trial included 148 stage II–III rectal cancer patients. Eligibility criteria were histologically confirmed rectal cancer. Participants underwent pre-operative CRT followed by surgery. DNA was extracted from pretreatment tumor biopsies and paired normal surgical tissues for KRAS and TP53 genotyping. The primary outcome was pathologic complete response (pCR) measured post-surgery. Randomisation and allocation concealment methods were not specified. Blinding details were not provided.\n\nResults: Sixty patients had KRAS mutations; 12 in codon 13, and 48 in other locations. Eighty patients had TP53 mutations; 27 had concurrent KRAS/TP53 mutations. Tumors with any KRAS mutation were less likely to achieve pCR compared to wildtype KRAS (p=0.006). Specifically, no tumors with KRAS codon 13 mutations achieved pCR (p=0.03). Tumors with KRAS codon 13 mutations had a higher incidence of concurrent TP53 mutations (p=0.02). The analysis approach was not specified.\n\nInterpretation: Mutations in different KRAS codons may have varying effects on rectal cancer resistance to CRT, potentially due to differing frequencies of TP53 mutations. These findings suggest the need for further research to understand the molecular interactions influencing treatment response.\n\nHarm: Adverse events were not reported. Trial registration: Not provided. Funding: Not specified.",
