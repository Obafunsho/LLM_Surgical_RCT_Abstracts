The primary outcome was overall survival, measured over a median follow-up of 20 years. Randomisation and blinding were not applicable due to the study's retrospective nature. The study was approved by the institutional review board, and informed consent was waived.\n\nResults: Of the 1915 patients, 1752 underwent conventional CABG and 163 underwent MIDCAB. Early mortality was lower in the MIDCAB group (0.6% vs. 3.6%, p = 0.042). Long-term survival rates at 10, 15, and 20 years were higher in the MIDCAB group: 76.7% vs. 55.1%, 63.7% vs. 37.1%, and 53.4% vs. 23.1%, respectively (p < 0.001). In a matched cohort of 134 patients each, late survival remained superior for MIDCAB (p = 0.004). Multivariable analysis showed a hazard ratio of 0.429 (95% CI 0.321–0.574, p < 0.001) for the whole cohort and 0.559 (95% CI: 0.376–0.831, p = 0.004) for the matched cohort.\n\nInterpretation: MIDCAB demonstrated better early safety and long-term effectiveness compared to conventional CABG for LAD revascularization. The study was not randomised, and selection bias cannot be ruled out. No specific funding was received for this study.\n\nTrial registration: Not applicable.",
