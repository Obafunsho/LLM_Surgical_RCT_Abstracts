This study evaluates their effects on body composition and adipocyte function.\n\nMethods: This randomised, open-label trial was conducted at a private cosmetic surgery center and Washington University School of Medicine, St Louis, Missouri. Thirteen women with a BMI <30 kg/m² and suitable lower abdominal fat were enrolled between July and November 2008. Participants were randomised by the final digit of their Social Security numbers to receive PC-DC injections on one side of the abdomen, with the contralateral side as control. The primary outcome was the change in adipose tissue thickness, measured 8 weeks after the final treatment. Randomisation was not concealed, and neither patients nor clinicians were blinded.\n\nResults: Seven women completed the study. PC-DC treatment significantly reduced anterior subcutaneous abdominal fat thickness (mean difference = 4.1 cm, 95% CI 1.4 to 6.8; p = 0.004). No changes were observed in plasma C-reactive protein, lipid profile, or glucose concentrations. Adverse events included mild to moderate local reactions, with no serious adverse events reported.\n\nInterpretation: PC-DC injections effectively reduce abdominal fat by inducing adipocyte necrosis without affecting systemic inflammation or metabolism.
