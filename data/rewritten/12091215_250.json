Randomization was stratified by region (United States or Japan) using an Interactive Response Technology system, with allocation concealed from investigators and patients. The primary outcome was CMV infection by week 16. The study was conducted between July 2020 and August 2022.\n\nResults: A total of 87 participants were randomized: 38 to 6 mg/kg NPC-21, 11 to 12 mg/kg NPC-21, and 38 to placebo. CMV infections occurred in 76.3%, 81.8%, and 68.4% of patients in the 6 mg/kg NPC-21, 12 mg/kg NPC-21, and placebo groups, respectively, with no statistically significant differences. CMV disease occurred in 4.1% of the combined NPC-21 group versus 13.2% in the placebo group. No significant adverse events were observed.\n\nInterpretation: NPC-21 was safe but did not significantly reduce CMV infection rates compared to placebo. However, severe CMV disease was less frequent in the NPC-21 group. Further studies are needed to explore NPC-21's role in CMV prevention.\n\nTrial registration: [Trial registration number]\n\nFunding: [Source of funding]",
