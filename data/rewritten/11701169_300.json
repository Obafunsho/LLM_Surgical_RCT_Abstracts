A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Ultrasound-Guided Stellate Ganglion Blockade in Thoracoscopic Pulmonary Lobectomy\n\nBackground: Single-lung ventilation (SLV) is commonly used in thoracic surgery but can cause hypoxemia due to intrapulmonary shunt and hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction. This study investigates the potential of ultrasound-guided stellate ganglion blockade (SGB) to mitigate these complications.\n\nMethods: Conducted at Quanzhou First Hospital affiliated with Fujian Medical University, this prospective, randomised, double-blind trial included patients aged 18-75 undergoing elective thoracoscopic pulmonary lobectomy. A total of 88 patients were randomised to receive either SGB (n=40) or standard care (n=39). The primary outcome was the change in oxygenation index (OI) and pulmonary shunt fraction (Qs/Qt) during SLV, measured at multiple time points. Randomisation was computer-generated, and allocation was concealed using sealed envelopes. Blinding included patients, clinicians, and outcome assessors.\n\nResults: SGB significantly improved OI and reduced Qs/Qt compared to controls. The SGB group demonstrated increased dynamic lung compliance and decreased mean airway pressure. Inflammatory markers IL-6 and IL-8 were significantly lower in the SGB group. No severe adverse events were reported, with mild complications occurring in 3% of the SGB group and 1% of the control group.\n\nInterpretation: Ultrasound-guided SGB improves respiratory mechanics and reduces inflammatory responses during SLV, indicating a protective role in thoracic surgery. These findings suggest that SGB could be a valuable intervention for reducing SLV-related complications. Further research is warranted to explore its long-term benefits and applicability in broader clinical settings.\n\nTrial registration: Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (#ChiCTR2200063210).\n\nFunding: Not specified.",
