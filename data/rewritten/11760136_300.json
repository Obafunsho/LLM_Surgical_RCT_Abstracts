Randomisation was performed using concealed envelopes, and the study was double-blind. The primary outcome was postoperative pain control measured by the numeric pain rating scale (NRS) over 48 hours. Secondary outcomes included hemodynamic parameters, motor block assessment, sensory block duration, and analgesia duration.\n\nResults: Fifty-five patients were analysed per protocol (group R: n = 27, group D: n = 28). Both groups achieved similar pain control (NRS scores, p > 0.05). Group D experienced significantly lower rates of urinary retention (28.6% vs. 59.3%, p = 0.022) and pruritus, while sedation was higher in group D in the recovery room. Group R had higher systolic pressure in the recovery room. No significant differences were observed in sensory block duration or analgesia duration. Adverse events included sedation in group D and higher systolic pressure in group R.\n\nInterpretation: Low-concentration PCEA with epidural dexmedetomidine provides similar analgesia after TKA as high-concentration PCEA with fewer side effects, particularly urinary retention and pruritus.
