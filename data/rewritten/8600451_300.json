A 300-word version\n\nTitle: A Randomised Controlled Trial of Inhaled Epoprostenol vs. Inhaled Nitric Oxide in Lung Transplantation\n\nBackground: Inhaled nitric oxide (iNO) is standard for pulmonary vasodilation and oxidative injury prevention post-lung transplant (LT). Inhaled epoprostenol (iEPO) offers a cost-effective alternative, yet lacks robust evidence.\n\nMethods: This randomised, blinded, parallel-designed equivalence trial involved 201 adult LT patients from a health system between May 30, 2017, and March 21, 2020. Eligibility included adult patients undergoing single or bilateral LT. Participants were stratified by key prognostic features and randomised 1:1 to iNO or iEPO using computer-generated sequences with allocation concealment. Blinding encompassed participants, clinicians, data managers, and statisticians. The primary outcome was severe/grade 3 primary graft dysfunction (PGD-3) at 24, 48, or 72 hours post-LT. Intention-to-treat analysis was performed.\n\nResults: 201 patients were randomised; 103 to iEPO and 98 to iNO. In the intention-to-treat analysis, PGD-3 occurred in 46/103 (44.7%) iEPO and 39/98 (39.8%) iNO, with a risk difference of 4.9% (TOST 90% CI, –6.4% to 16.2%; P = .02 for equivalence). Secondary outcomes, including mechanical ventilation duration, hospital and ICU stay lengths, acute kidney injury incidence, tracheostomy placement, and mortality rates, showed no significant between-group differences. No significant adverse events were reported.\n\nInterpretation: iEPO is equivalent to iNO in reducing PGD-3 risk post-LT, with no significant differences in secondary outcomes or adverse events.
