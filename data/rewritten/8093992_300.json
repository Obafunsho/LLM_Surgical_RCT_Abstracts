A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Predictive Variables for Mortality in Endovascular Thrombectomy: A Secondary Analysis of the DEFUSE 3 Randomised Controlled Trial\n\nBackground: The DEFUSE 3 trial assessed endovascular thrombectomy (EVT) in ischemic stroke patients 6–16 hours after last known normal. This secondary analysis aims to identify predictive variables for mortality in EVT-treated patients.\n\nMethods: This cohort analysis included 92 EVT-treated patients from the DEFUSE 3 trial, selected based on specific inclusion criteria. The primary outcome was mortality within 90 days. We developed a predictive score using preprocedural variables statistically associated with death in univariate regression analysis (P<0.1).\n\nResults: Of the 92 patients (mean age 69 years; 50% male), 15.2% met the primary outcome. Age, baseline NIHSS score, wake-up stroke, and diabetes were associated with mortality. Statin use was excluded from the model. The predictive score assigned one point each for age >75 years, NIHSS ≥20, wake-up stroke, and diabetes, categorizing patients into low (0–1), moderate (2), and high (3–4) risk of death. Mortality rates were 3.9% in low-risk, 13.0% in moderate-risk, and 52.9% in high-risk categories (P<0.001).\n\nInterpretation: Despite selective inclusion and EVT benefits, a significant number of patients died. Age, NIHSS, wake-up stroke, and diabetes may predict mortality risk. The predictive score offers a basis for future research on factors influencing lethal outcomes post-EVT. Further studies are needed to validate these findings and explore interventions to mitigate risk in high-risk patients. The trial was registered under [Trial Registration Number] and funded by [Funding Source].",
