This study aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of DBS targeted at the ventral anterior limb of the internal capsule (vALIC) in TRD patients.\n\nMethods: This randomised controlled trial involved 25 TRD patients recruited from two hospitals in the Netherlands. Eligible participants met criteria for major depressive disorder and had not responded to multiple treatment steps. All patients underwent DBS surgery and participated in a 1-year optimisation phase followed by a 1-year open-label maintenance phase. Depression severity was measured using the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D-17), Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS), and self-reported Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology (IDS-SR). The primary outcome was the response rate (≥50% HAM-D-17 score reduction) after the maintenance phase.\n\nResults: Of the 25 patients, 21 entered and 18 completed the maintenance phase. Eight patients were classified as responders (observed response rate: 44.4%; intention-to-treat: 32.0%). HAM-D-17 and MADRS scores remained stable, while IDS-SR scores decreased significantly (p=0.008). Four serious adverse events occurred, including one suicide attempt, but none were related to DBS.\n\nInterpretation: vALIC DBS showed continued efficacy in TRD patients 2 years after surgery, with stable clinician-rated symptoms and improved patient-rated symptoms. This supports DBS as a viable treatment option for TRD, offering a potential alternative to traditional therapies.\n\nTrial registration: NTR2118.\n\nFunding: Not specified.",
