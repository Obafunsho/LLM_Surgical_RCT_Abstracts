This study aimed to compare the effectiveness and safety of various image guidance systems against standard surgery.\n\nMethods: In this preclinical randomised study, 50 novice surgeons were allocated to one of five groups: (1) no image guidance, (2) triplanar display, (3) always-on solid overlay, (4) always-on wire mesh overlay, and (5) on-demand inverse realism overlay. Participants identified a basilar tip aneurysm in a validated model head. The primary outcomes were time to task completion (seconds) and tool path length (millimeters). Secondary outcomes included recognition of an unexpected finding and subjective depth perception. Randomisation was conducted using a computer-generated sequence, and allocation was concealed. Blinding was not applicable.\n\nResults: Time to task completion and tool path length were significantly lower with any image guidance compared to no guidance (p < 0.001 and p = 0.003, respectively). Tool path distance was lower in augmented reality groups compared to triplanar display (p = 0.010). Always-on solid overlay resulted in the greatest inattentional blindness (20% recognition). Wire mesh and on-demand overlays mitigated inattentional blindness, comparable to triplanar display (40% recognition). Wire mesh and inverse realism overlays improved subjective depth perception (p = 0.031 and p = 0.008).\n\nInterpretation: Augmented reality platforms may enhance performance in novice surgeons, though all modalities risk inattentional blindness. No adverse events were reported. Trial registration: [Number]. Funding: [Source].",
