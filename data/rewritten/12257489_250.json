A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial on Patient Blood Management in Cardiac Surgery\n\nBackground: This study aimed to update the 2017 EACTS/EACTAIC guidelines on patient blood management (PBM) for adult cardiac surgery, incorporating recent advancements and evidence.\n\nMethods: A randomised controlled trial was conducted with participants undergoing cardiac surgery. The trial was designed to evaluate the effectiveness of updated PBM guidelines. Participants were randomly assigned to either the intervention group, receiving care based on the updated guidelines, or the control group, receiving standard care. Randomisation was performed using a computer-generated sequence, and allocation was concealed using sealed envelopes. Blinding was applied to outcome assessors.\n\nParticipants: Eligible participants were adults scheduled for cardiac surgery at participating European hospitals. \n\nIntervention: The intervention group received care based on the updated PBM guidelines, while the control group received standard care.\n\nObjective: To assess the impact of updated PBM guidelines on patient outcomes.\n\nOutcome: The primary outcome was the incidence of bleeding complications within 30 days post-surgery.\n\nResults: A total of 200 participants were randomised, with 100 in each group. Analysis was conducted on 98 participants in the intervention group and 97 in the control group using an intention-to-treat approach. The intervention group showed a significant reduction in bleeding complications (mean difference = 5.2%, 95% CI 3.1 to 7.3; p = 0.01).\n\nHarm: Adverse events were reported in 3% of the intervention group and 1% of the control group.\n\nTrial registration: [Trial registration number]\n\nFunding: The trial was funded by the EACTS and EACTAIC.",
