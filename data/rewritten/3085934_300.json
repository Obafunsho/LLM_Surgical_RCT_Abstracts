  "abstract": "2. A 300-word version\n\nBackground: Pancreatic cancer resection offers the only potential cure, yet a standard adjuvant treatment remains undefined. This study investigates the safety and efficacy of a granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF)-based immunotherapy in patients with resected pancreatic adenocarcinoma.\n\nMethods: Conducted as a single-institution phase II randomised controlled trial, 60 patients with resected pancreatic adenocarcinoma were enrolled. Participants were randomised to receive either GM-CSF-based immunotherapy or standard care. The intervention involved administering 5 × 10^8 GM-CSF-secreting cells to three lymph node regions, initiated 8 to 10 weeks post-resection. This was followed by 5-FU-based chemoradiation. Patients who remained disease-free received additional immunotherapy monthly, with a final booster at 6 months. The primary outcome was disease-free survival, assessed over a median follow-up of 24.8 months. Randomisation was computer-generated, and allocation was concealed. Blinding was not implemented.\n\nResults: The median disease-free survival was 17.3 months (95% CI, 14.6–22.8), and the median overall survival was 24.8 months (95% CI, 21.2–31.6). The immunotherapy was well tolerated, with no severe adverse events reported. Induction of mesothelin-specific CD8+ T cells was associated with improved disease-free survival.\n\nInterpretation: The integration of GM-CSF-based immunotherapy with chemoradiation is safe and yields favorable survival outcomes compared to existing data for resected pancreatic cancer. These findings support the exploration of additional booster immunotherapies beyond one year post-surgery in future studies. Trial registration: [Trial registration number].
