A 300-word version\n\nBackground: This study aimed to describe the practice, techniques, anesthetics, additives, and adjuncts used in pediatric caudal epidural blocks in the Palestinian healthcare system and investigate factors associated with variations in these practices. Methods: A cross-sectional observational design was used, collecting data from 162 anesthesiologists across 28 hospitals in Palestine between May 2022 and January 2023. Participants were anesthesiologists practicing pediatric caudal epidural blocks. The study tool was a questionnaire based on previous surveys. Results: The response rate was 68.9%. The most frequently used local anesthetics were bupivacaine (91.4%) and lignocaine/lidocaine (16.0%). Additives and adjuncts included ketamine, opioids, midazolam, dexamethasone, and clonidine. More than half of the anesthesiologists reported an upper age limit of 4 years for caudal epidural anesthesia. The majority used gloves, gowns, and masks for asepsis. Variations in practices were associated with gender, experience, and training. Female anesthesiologists were more likely to use gauge size 22G, while those in private hospitals were more likely to use aspiration before injection. Anesthesiologists performing more than five blocks per month were more likely to use gauge size 24G. Interpretation: The study revealed significant variations in pediatric caudal epidural block practices, potentially due to resource limitations and access to materials. These findings could inform decision-makers and policymakers in developing evidence-based guidelines to improve practices and patient outcomes. No adverse events were reported. The study was not registered as a trial and was funded by An-Najah National University. The findings highlight the need for standardized techniques and increased use of ultrasound imaging to enhance safety and effectiveness in pediatric caudal epidural blocks.",
