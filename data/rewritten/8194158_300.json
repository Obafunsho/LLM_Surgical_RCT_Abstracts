Participants were adults undergoing shoulder arthroscopy, with eligibility criteria including the use of SSNB or ISB. The primary outcome was postoperative pain, measured using the Visual Analog Scale (VAS) at various time points. Randomisation and allocation concealment were adequately described in 15 and 16 studies, respectively. Blinding of outcome assessors was reported in all studies. The analysis was performed using a random-effects model.\n\nResults: 1255 patients were randomised, with 17 RCTs analysed. SSNB resulted in higher VAS at rest in PACU (MD = 0.56, 95% CI [0.19, 0.94], P = 0.003) and 1 hour post-operation (MD = 0.92, 95% CI [0.28, 1.57], P = 0.005), but lower VAS at 12 hours post-operation (MD = −0.71, 95% CI [−1.12, −0.3], P = 0.0006). No significant difference in oral morphine use at 24 hours (P = 0.35). SSNB had fewer complications, including Horner syndrome (P < 0.0001), numbness (P = 0.002), and dyspnea (P = 0.04). No significant difference in patient satisfaction (P = 0.14) or duration of PACU stay (P = 0.65).\n\nInterpretation: SSNB offers a safe alternative to ISB with similar pain control and fewer complications, particularly beneficial for patients with severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, obstructive sleep apnea, and morbid obesity. Further RCTs with long-term follow-up are needed to confirm these findings. Trial registration: CRD42020205426. Funding: Not specified.",
