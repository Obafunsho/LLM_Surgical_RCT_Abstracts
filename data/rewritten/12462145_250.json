  "abstract": "1. 250-word version\n\nBackground: A ruptured internal iliac artery aneurysm (IIAA) perforating the common iliac vein is a rare but life-threatening condition. This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of temporary balloon occlusion of an arteriovenous fistula (AVF) via the femoral vein in stabilizing hemodynamics before endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR).\n\nMethods: This was a single-case study conducted at a tertiary care hospital. An 80-year-old male patient with a ruptured IIAA and AVF was treated. The intervention involved temporary balloon occlusion of the AVF through the femoral vein, followed by EVAR with coil embolization. The primary outcome was hemodynamic stability, assessed immediately post-intervention.\n\nResults: The patient achieved hemodynamic stability following the temporary balloon occlusion of the AVF. Subsequent EVAR was performed successfully without complications. Postoperative computed tomography showed the absence of arteriovenous flow and no endoleaks. The patient was discharged 30 days after surgery with improved renal function and cardiac status.\n\nInterpretation: Temporary balloon occlusion of an AVF via the femoral vein can stabilize hemodynamics, enabling successful emergency EVAR under stable conditions. This approach may be beneficial in managing similar cases of ruptured IIAA with AVF.\n\nFunding: The authors reported no funding sources for this study.",
