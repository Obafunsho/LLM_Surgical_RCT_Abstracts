A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Adjuvant Statin Therapy in Oesophageal Adenocarcinoma\n\nBackground: Statins have shown potential in improving survival in oesophageal adenocarcinoma (OAC). This study aimed to assess the feasibility of a phase III RCT of adjuvant statin therapy in operable OAC.\n\nMethods: This multicentre, double-blind, parallel-group, randomised, placebo-controlled feasibility trial included adults with OAC (including Siewert I–II lesions) post-oesophagectomy. Participants were centrally randomised (1:1) to simvastatin 40 mg or placebo using block randomisation, stratified by centre. Blinding included participants, clinicians, and investigators. The primary outcome was drug absorption, measured by LDL cholesterol levels at 3 months. Recruitment occurred from October 2014 to July 2016.\n\nResults: Of 120 patients assessed, 32 (26.7%) were randomised, 16 per group. Seven withdrew. Simvastatin reduced LDL cholesterol by 3 months (adjusted mean difference −0.83 mmol/l, 95% CI −1.4 to −0.22; p = 0.009). Median adherence exceeded 90% between 3 and 12 months. Adverse events were similar between groups, with no significant differences in frequency or severity. Quality-of-life data completion was 98.3%. Cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and aspirin use were more prevalent in non-randomised patients, while tumour site, stage, and grade were similar between groups. Survival estimates were imprecise.\n\nInterpretation: This RCT demonstrates the feasibility of conducting a phase III trial of adjuvant statin therapy in OAC, providing insights into recruitment, retention, and adherence. The study highlights the need for smaller, more easily swallowed medication to improve retention. Trial registration: ISRCTN98060456. Funding: Not specified.",
