A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Reoperation Techniques for Mitral Valve Repair Failure\n\nBackground: Mitral valve repair failure due to recurrent prolapse poses a challenge in cardiac surgery. This study evaluates reoperation techniques for mitral valve repair failure.\n\nMethods: This retrospective study included 11 patients with moderately severe or severe mitral regurgitation due to recurrent prolapse after initial posterior leaflet repair with artificial chordae and annuloplasty at Cleveland Clinic from January 1, 2008, to January 31, 2023. The primary outcome was the degree of mitral regurgitation post-reoperation, assessed by echocardiogram at discharge and follow-up (median 20 months). \n\nResults: Ten patients underwent mitral valve re-repair, and one had valve replacement. Re-repair techniques included new, shorter artificial chordae (n=5), posterior leaflet resection (n=5), and new annuloplasty (n=8). All patients had no or trace mitral regurgitation at discharge. At last follow-up, all had mild MR or less. No operative mortality or major complications occurred.\n\nInterpretation: Re-repair techniques, including leaflet resection and shorter chordae, are effective for mitral valve repair failure due to recurrent prolapse, with excellent midterm outcomes. Further studies are needed to understand the mechanisms involved in reverse remodeling.\n\nTrial registration: IRB# 23-844.\n\nFunding: Not specified.",
