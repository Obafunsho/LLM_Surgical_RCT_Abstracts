  "abstract": "1. A 250-word version\n\nBackground: Electrocorticography (ECoG) is a tool for presurgical functional mapping, with high gamma activity observed during motor tasks. This study aims to validate ECoG for presurgical mapping by comparing it with direct electrical cortical stimulation (ECS) and functional MRI (fMRI).\n\nMethods: Seventeen epilepsy patients participated in an ECoG motor mapping experiment at a single center. Eligibility included patients undergoing presurgical evaluation. Patients performed a 5-minute hand/tongue movement task while ECoG signals were recorded. All patients underwent ECS mapping, and eight also had fMRI. High gamma activity was modeled using the general linear model (GLM), and regions with significant gamma power increase were localized. Maps from GLM-based ECoG, ECS, and fMRI were compared.\n\nResults: GLM-based ECoG mapping showed consistent motor region localization with ECS. ECoG had higher sensitivity than fMRI (66.7% vs. 52.6%, p < 0.05) with high specificity for both (>97%). Adjusting for ECS current-spreading, ECoG mapping achieved 100% sensitivity and 99.5% specificity. No adverse events were reported.\n\nInterpretation: GLM-based ECoG mapping is efficient and accurate for motor function mapping, outperforming ECS and fMRI. It provides reliable results in under 5 minutes.",
