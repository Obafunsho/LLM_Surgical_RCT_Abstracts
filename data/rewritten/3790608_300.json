Forty patients, aged 18-60 years, classified as American Society of Anesthesiologists grade I and II, were enrolled. Exclusion criteria included risk of aspiration, limited mouth opening, and specific medical conditions. Participants were randomly assigned to Group I (Index Finger) or Group T (Thumb Insertion), with 20 patients in each group. Randomisation was performed using sealed numbered envelopes, and outcome assessors were blinded. The primary outcome was ease of insertion, measured immediately after insertion. Secondary outcomes included fiberoptic laryngoscopic position, cuff pressures, and laryngopharyngeal morbidity.\n\nResults: Both groups demonstrated comparable results in terms of ease of insertion, fiberoptic view scores, cuff pressures, and laryngopharyngeal morbidity. The mean insertion time was 29.00 seconds for Group I and 34.00 seconds for Group T, with no statistically significant difference. No adverse events were reported in either group. The analysis was conducted on all randomised participants, adhering to an intention-to-treat approach.\n\nInterpretation: The thumb insertion technique is as effective as the index finger technique for LMA Classic™ insertion, offering similar outcomes in ease of insertion and patient safety. This alternative technique may be particularly useful in scenarios where access to the patient's head end is restricted, such as in mass casualty situations.\n\nTrial registration: Not provided.\n\nFunding: Not reported.",
