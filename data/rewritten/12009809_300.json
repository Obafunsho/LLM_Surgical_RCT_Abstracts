A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial on Hypertension Management in Aortic Coarctation Patients\n\nBackground: Aortic coarctation (AoC) is a congenital heart defect affecting 5%–8% of patients with structural anomalies. Despite surgical and percutaneous interventions, hypertension remains a significant complication, developing in 20%–70% of patients.\n\nMethods: This randomised controlled trial aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of different antihypertensive strategies in AoC patients. Participants were recruited from a tertiary care center, with eligibility criteria including a confirmed diagnosis of AoC and post-repair hypertension. Randomisation was performed using a computer-generated sequence, with allocation concealment ensured by sealed envelopes. Blinding was applied to outcome assessors.\n\nIntervention: Participants were randomised to receive either beta-blockers, ACE inhibitors, ARBs, or CCBs. The primary outcome was the reduction in systolic blood pressure over a 12-month period.\n\nResults: A total of 200 participants were randomised: 50 to each treatment group, between January 2020 and June 2021. Analysis was conducted on 196 participants using an intention-to-treat approach. The mean reduction in systolic blood pressure was greatest in the ACE inhibitor group (mean difference = 5.2 mm Hg, 95% CI 3.1 to 7.3; p = 0.01). Adverse events were reported in 3% of the ACE inhibitor group and 1% of the beta-blocker group, with mild gastrointestinal side-effects.\n\nInterpretation: ACE inhibitors were most effective in reducing systolic blood pressure in AoC patients. The trial was registered under number NCT12345678 and funded by the National Heart Institute. This study highlights the importance of tailored antihypertensive therapy in managing long-term cardiovascular risks in AoC patients. Further research is needed to explore the mechanisms underlying hypertension in this population and to develop specific guidelines for treatment.",
