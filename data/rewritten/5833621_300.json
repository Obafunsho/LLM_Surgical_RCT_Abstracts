A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Adjuvant Radiotherapy Plus Chemotherapy vs Chemotherapy Alone in Locally Advanced Bladder Cancer\n\nBackground: Locoregional failure in locally advanced bladder cancer (LABC) post-radical cystectomy (RC) remains high despite chemotherapy. This study investigates whether adjuvant radiotherapy (RT) plus chemotherapy enhances locoregional recurrence-free survival (LRFS) compared to chemotherapy alone.\n\nMethods: Conducted as a randomised phase 2 trial at an academic center, patients were enrolled from December 2002 to July 2008. Eligibility criteria included age ≤70 years, ≥pT3b, grade 3, or positive nodes, and negative margins post-RC. Randomisation was weighted to expedite accrual. Interventions were chemotherapy plus RT (2 cycles of gemcitabine and cisplatin before and after RT) versus chemotherapy alone (4 cycles of gemcitabine and cisplatin). The primary outcome was LRFS over 2 years, analysed using an intention-to-treat approach. Routine follow-up included pelvic CT scans every 6 months for 2 years.\n\nResults: A total of 120 patients were randomised: 75 to chemotherapy plus RT and 45 to chemotherapy alone. LRFS was 96% vs 69% (HR, 0.08; 95% CI, 0.02-0.39; P < .01). Disease-free survival was 68% vs 56% (HR, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.27-1.06; P = .07), and overall survival was 71% vs 60% (HR, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.33-1.11; P = .11). RT-associated late grade 3 gastrointestinal adverse effects were observed in 7% of the chemotherapy plus RT group.\n\nInterpretation: Adjuvant chemotherapy plus RT was well tolerated and significantly improved LRFS, with marginal improvements in disease-free survival compared to chemotherapy alone. These findings support further investigation in phase 3 trials. Trial registration: NCT01734798. Funding: Not specified.",
