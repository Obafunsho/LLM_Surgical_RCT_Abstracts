A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Ultrasound Guidance for Femoral Perineural Catheters\n\nBackground: This randomised controlled trial assessed whether ultrasound guidance alone is noninferior to ultrasound with electrical stimulation for femoral perineural catheter placement in knee arthroplasty patients, focusing on postoperative pain and opioid use.\n\nMethods: Conducted at [study setting], patients undergoing knee arthroplasty were randomly assigned to one of three groups: 1) ultrasound alone (n=147); 2) ultrasound with electrical stimulation through the needle (n=152); or 3) ultrasound with electrical stimulation through both the needle and catheter (n=138). The primary outcomes were postoperative pain scores on a 0–10 Verbal Response Scale (VRS) and opioid consumption, assessed over 48 hours. Randomisation was computer-generated, with allocation concealment. Outcome assessors were blinded.\n\nResults: The stimulating needle group was noninferior to the stimulating catheter group in mean VRS pain score (difference −0.16, 95% CI −0.61 to 0.29, P<0.001) and opioid consumption (percent difference −5%, 95% CI −25% to 21%, P=0.002). Ultrasound alone was faster and cheaper, with no significant adverse events reported. The ultrasound-only group showed a mean VRS pain score difference of −0.28 (95% CI −0.72 to 0.16, P<0.001) compared to the stimulating needle group, and a percent difference in opioid consumption of −2% (95% CI −22% to 25%, P=0.006).\n\nInterpretation: Ultrasound guidance alone is a noninferior and cost-effective method for femoral nerve catheter insertion, offering advantages in speed and cost without compromising pain management. No significant adverse events were observed across groups.\n\nTrial registration: [Trial registration number]\n\nFunding: [Source of funding]",
