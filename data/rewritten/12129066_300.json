A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Preoperative Enema in Anal Surgery: A Randomised Controlled Trial\n\nBackground: This randomised controlled trial assessed the efficacy of preoperative enemas in reducing postoperative pain and complications in anal surgeries, including haemorrhoidal and anal fistula procedures.\n\nMethods: Conducted at Taipei Medical University Shuang-Ho Hospital, Taiwan, from November 2022 to August 2023, the study enrolled adults aged 20–85 years with grade III or IV haemorrhoids or anal fistulas. Participants were randomly assigned to receive either a preoperative enema (n=133) or no enema (n=133). Randomisation was computer-generated with allocation concealment via sealed envelopes. Surgeons and data analysts were blinded. The primary outcome was postoperative pain measured by the visual analogue scale (VAS) from day 0 to day 7. Secondary outcomes included postoperative complications such as infection, bleeding, and urinary retention.\n\nResults: Of the 266 patients analysed, no significant differences were observed in VAS scores, analgesic consumption, or complications between the enema and control groups. Subgroup analysis revealed no significant differences for stapled haemorrhoidopexy and anal fistula surgeries. However, in Milligan–Morgan haemorrhoidectomy, the control group had significantly higher VAS scores on days 2 to 4 (P < 0.05). No adverse events related to enemas were reported.\n\nInterpretation: Preoperative enemas did not yield additional benefits or reduce complications in anal surgeries, except for reduced pain in Milligan–Morgan haemorrhoidectomy. The routine use of enemas can be omitted, particularly in stapled haemorrhoidopexy and anal fistula surgeries. Further studies with larger sample sizes are needed to confirm these findings.\n\nTrial registration: NCT05602987\n\nFunding: Not specified.",
