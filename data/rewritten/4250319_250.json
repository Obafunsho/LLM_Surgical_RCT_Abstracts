A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Surgical Ventricular Reconstruction in Coronary Artery Disease\n\nBackground: The Surgical Treatment for Ischemic Heart Failure (STICH) trial evaluated the efficacy of surgical ventricular reconstruction (SVR) plus coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) versus CABG alone in patients with coronary artery disease and left ventricular dysfunction.\n\nMethods: This randomised controlled trial included 1,000 patients, with 267 assessed for myocardial viability using single photon computed tomography. Participants were randomised to either CABG alone or CABG plus SVR. The primary outcome was mortality or cardiac hospitalization over a 3-year period. Randomisation was conducted centrally, with allocation concealment ensured. Blinding was not specified.\n\nResults: At 3 years, there was no significant difference in mortality or the combined outcome of death or cardiac hospitalization between patients with and without myocardial viability. No significant interaction was found between surgery type and global viability status. Additionally, no difference was observed in outcomes based on anterior wall or apical scar presence. The analysis was conducted on an intention-to-treat basis.\n\nInterpretation: Myocardial viability assessment does not identify patients who benefit from adding SVR to CABG in terms of mortality or cardiac hospitalization. Adverse events were not reported. Trial registration and funding details were not provided.",
