A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Patient-Controlled Epidural Analgesia vs. Continuous Epidural Analgesia in Surgical Patients\n\nBackground: While patient-controlled epidural analgesia (PCEA) has shown benefits over continuous epidural analgesia (CEA) in obstetric patients, its efficacy in surgical patients remains unclear.\n\nMethods: This systematic review included six randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing PCEA and CEA in adult surgical patients. The primary outcome was pain scores on postoperative day one (POD1). Secondary outcomes included total analgesic dose, systemic analgesics, manual top-ups, side effects, and patient satisfaction. The Cochrane risk-of-bias tool (RoB2) assessed study quality. The review was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42018106644).\n\nResults: A total of 480 participants were randomised across six RCTs. Two studies reported significantly reduced resting pain scores on POD1 with PCEA (36–44% reduction, p < 0.05), while four studies found no significant difference. PCEA reduced epidural medication use by 28% to 40% (p < 0.01) in four studies. One study found a 23% reduction in top-ups (p < 0.001) and reduced intravenous morphine use (0.16 vs. 3.45 mg, p < 0.05) with PCEA. PCEA patients reported higher satisfaction (p < 0.001) in two studies. Nausea and vomiting were less frequent with PCEA (p = 0.01). Adverse events such as hypotension and respiratory depression showed no significant differences between groups.\n\nInterpretation: PCEA did not significantly reduce pain scores compared to CEA. However, PCEA demonstrated advantages in reducing epidural drug use, systemic analgesic requirements, and top-ups, while improving patient satisfaction. These findings suggest PCEA may offer benefits in surgical settings, warranting further research focusing on composite postoperative comfort scores.\n\nTrial registration: PROSPERO CRD42018106644.\n\nFunding: Not specified.",
