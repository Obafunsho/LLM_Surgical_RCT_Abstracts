A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Dexmedetomidine and Propofol in Hysteroscopic Surgery\n\nBackground: This study aimed to establish the optimal dose of dexmedetomidine combined with propofol for hysteroscopic surgery, focusing on propofol-sparing effects and sedation quality.\n\nMethods: In this randomised controlled trial, 150 patients aged 18-60 years with ASA status I-II undergoing hysteroscopic surgery at the Affiliated Hospital of North Sichuan Medical College were randomly assigned to receive dexmedetomidine at 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, or 1.0 µg/kg, or saline. Propofol was administered via target-controlled infusion. The primary outcome was the EC50 of propofol, measured intraoperatively. Randomisation was performed using SPSS software, and allocation was concealed. Both patients and clinicians were blinded. Recruitment occurred from June to November 2020.\n\nResults: The EC50 of propofol was significantly lower in the Dex 0.6, Dex 0.8, and Dex 1.0 groups compared to the saline group (p < 0.05). As dexmedetomidine dose increased, propofol requirements and respiratory depression incidence decreased (p < 0.01), while bradycardia incidence increased (p = 0.02). No significant differences in hypotension were observed among groups. Postoperative comfort scores were higher in the Dex1.0 group. Ramsay scores at t1 and t2 were higher in the Dex0.8 and Dex1.0 groups than in the saline group (p < 0.05). No significant differences were observed in VAS scores among groups.\n\nInterpretation: Dexmedetomidine at 0.8 µg/kg provides an optimal balance between propofol-sparing effects, sedation quality, and manageable side effects for hysteroscopic surgery.
