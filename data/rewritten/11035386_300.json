This study aimed to assess pre-endovascular repair anatomical characteristics in patients from the Global Iliac Branch Study (GIBS, NCT05607277) to enhance selection criteria for iliac branch devices (IBD) and improve long-term outcomes.\n\nMethods: This multicenter, retrospective study analyzed pre-treatment CT scans of 297 patients undergoing endovascular aneurysm repair. Measurements included total iliac artery length, common iliac artery length, tortuosity index, common iliac artery splay angle, internal iliac artery stenosis, calcification score, and diameters in the device's landing zone. Statistical tests assessed differences in anatomical measurements and IBD-mediated internal iliac artery preservation.\n\nResults: Left total iliac artery length was shorter than right (6.7 mm, P = 0.0019); right common iliac artery less tortuous (P = 0.0145). Males exhibited greater tortuosity in the left total iliac artery (P = 0.0475) and larger diameter in left internal iliac artery's landing zone (P = 0.0453). Preservation was more common on right (158 unilateral, 34 bilateral) than left (105 unilateral, 34 bilateral). There were 192 right-sided and 139 left-sided IBDs, with 318 IBDs in males and 13 in females.\n\nInterpretation: This study provides comprehensive pre-treatment iliac anatomy analysis, highlighting differences between sides and sexes. These findings could refine patient selection for IBD placement, potentially enhancing outcomes in aortoiliac aneurysm treatment. The limited number of females underscores the need for further research. Trial registration: NCT05607277. Funding: Not specified. The study's retrospective nature and reliance on clinical trial registry data may introduce biases, but the inclusion of multiple centers enhances generalizability. Further research is needed to generalize findings across genders.",
