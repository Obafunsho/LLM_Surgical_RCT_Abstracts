A 250-word version\n\nTitle: The effect of sildenafil on post-cardiac surgery acute kidney injury: a randomised controlled trial.\n\nBackground: This study evaluated whether intravenous sildenafil citrate prevents acute kidney injury (AKI) in patients undergoing cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass.\n\nMethods: In a double-blind, parallel-group randomised controlled trial, 129 adults at increased risk of AKI undergoing cardiac surgery at a single UK tertiary centre were randomised to receive either sildenafil citrate 12.5 mg intravenously over 150 minutes or a dextrose 5% placebo at the start of surgery. The primary outcome was serum creatinine concentration measured at six time points up to 96 hours post-surgery. Randomisation was stratified by procedure type and baseline estimated glomerular filtration rate, with allocation concealed. Patients, clinicians, and outcome assessors were blinded. The primary analysis used a linear mixed-effects model adjusted for stratification variables.\n\nResults: Between September 2015 and September 2018, 60 participants were randomised to sildenafil and 69 to placebo. The intention-to-treat analysis showed no significant difference in serum creatinine between groups (mean difference: 0.88 μmol/L, 95% CI: -5.82 to 7.59, p = 0.797). Multiple organ dysfunction scores were significantly higher in the sildenafil group (mean difference: 0.54, 95% CI: 0.02 to 1.07, p = 0.044). No significant differences were observed in secondary outcomes or biomarkers. Adverse events were similar between groups.\n\nInterpretation: Intravenous sildenafil citrate does not reduce AKI severity in adult cardiac surgery patients. \n\nTrial registration: ISRCTN18386427.\n\nFunding: British Heart Foundation and Leicester and Bristol National Institute for Health Research Cardiovascular Biomedical Research Units.",
