This study evaluates the efficacy of L-Ornithine-L-Aspartate (LOLA) in improving angiogenesis and perfusion in a rat model of hind limb ischemia (HLI).\n\nMethods: Male Sprague Dawley rats (n=21) were randomly assigned to three groups: control (normal saline), sorbitol, and LOLA. The femoral artery was unilaterally ligated to induce HLI. Intraperitoneal injections were administered on post-operative days (PODs) 3, 5, 7, 10, and 12. Perfusion imaging was conducted on PODs 7 and 14. Immunohistochemistry and Western blotting were performed post-imaging. Randomisation was stratified by body weight, and outcome assessors were blinded.\n\nResults: Group 3 (LOLA) showed a significant increase in perfusion recovery (mean difference = 13.77, 95% CI 1.23 to 26.31; p < 0.05) and higher CD31-positive capillary density compared to control and sorbitol groups. VEGF expression was also significantly elevated in the LOLA group.\n\nInterpretation: LOLA administration in a rat HLI model significantly enhances angiogenesis and perfusion recovery. With its commercial availability, LOLA could be rapidly translated into clinical use for PAD treatment.\n\nTrial registration: Not applicable.\n\nFunding: Not specified.",
