A 250-word version\n\nTitle: A Randomised Controlled Trial of Angiotensin-2 vs. Noradrenaline in Cardiac Surgery\n\nBackground: Acute kidney injury (AKI) is prevalent post-cardiac surgery, potentially exacerbated by vasoplegic hypotension. This study evaluates the feasibility of using angiotensin-2 compared to noradrenaline to maintain peri-operative blood pressure.\n\nMethods: This double-blind, randomised feasibility trial was conducted at two metropolitan hospitals in Melbourne, Australia. Participants were adults at elevated risk of AKI undergoing cardiac surgery. They were randomly allocated to receive either angiotensin-2 or noradrenaline, titrated to maintain a mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 70–80 mmHg intra-operatively and up to 48 hours postoperatively. The primary outcome was feasibility, assessed by consent rate, protocol adherence, infusion duration, MAP maintenance, and major adverse outcomes. Randomisation was computer-generated, with allocation concealment via a REDCap database. Blinding included participants, clinicians, and outcome assessors.\n\nResults: Sixty participants were randomised (28 to angiotensin-2, 32 to noradrenaline) between March and September 2021. Analysis was intention-to-treat. Protocol adherence was 100% for angiotensin-2 and 94% for noradrenaline. AKI occurred in 25% of the angiotensin-2 group and 38% of the noradrenaline group (p=0.31). One stroke, one extracorporeal support, and three renal replacement therapies occurred in the noradrenaline group.\n\nInterpretation: The trial demonstrates feasibility for a larger study comparing angiotensin-2 with noradrenaline in cardiac surgery. The findings support further investigation into angiotensin-2's effects on renal outcomes.\n\nTrial registration: Australian and New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry.\n\nFunding: Not specified.",
