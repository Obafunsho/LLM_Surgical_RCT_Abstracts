A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Acupuncture for Pain Management in Surgical Oncology Patients Undergoing Thoracotomy\n\nBackground: This randomised controlled trial investigated whether a specially developed acupuncture technique could reduce postoperative pain and analgesic use in surgical oncology patients undergoing thoracotomy.\n\nMethods: Conducted at [study setting], 162 cancer patients scheduled for thoracotomy were randomised to receive either A) preoperative implantation of small intradermal needles retained for 4 weeks (intervention) or B) preoperative placement of sham needles (control). Eligibility criteria included [participant eligibility criteria]. The primary outcome was pain intensity measured by the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) at 30 days post-surgery. Secondary outcomes included chronic pain assessments at 60 and 90 days, in-patient pain, and medication use. Randomisation was performed using a computer-generated sequence with allocation concealment. Blinding was maintained for patients, clinicians, and outcome assessors. Recruitment occurred between [recruitment period].\n\nResults: A total of 81 participants were randomised to each group. Analysis was conducted on [number analysed] using an intention-to-treat approach. At 30 days, there was no significant difference in BPI pain intensity scores between the intervention and control groups (mean difference = 0.05, 95% CI: -0.64 to 0.74; p=0.9). Secondary outcomes also showed no significant differences. Adverse events were not reported, indicating the safety of the intervention.\n\nInterpretation: The acupuncture technique did not significantly reduce pain or analgesic use compared to sham acupuncture. These findings suggest that the technique may not be effective for pain management in this patient population. Trial registration: [Trial registration number]. Funding: [Source of funding].",
