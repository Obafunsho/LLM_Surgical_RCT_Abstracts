Eligibility criteria included COPD, asthma, recent lower respiratory tract infection, BMI ≥35 kg/m², or heavy smoking. The primary outcome was hospital length of stay, measured from surgery to discharge. Randomisation was performed using a computer-generated sequence with allocation concealment via a centralised online system. Surgical and nursing teams responsible for discharge were blinded to group allocation.\n\nResults: Median hospital length of stay was 7 days (IQR 6–9) in the HFNO group and 9 days (IQR 7–16) in the standard group (p=0.012). The geometric mean hospital stay was 29% lower in the HFNO group (95% CI 11–44%, p=0.004). ICU re-admissions were significantly fewer in the HFNO group (1/49) compared to the standard group (7/45; p=0.026). No significant adverse events were reported in either group.\n\nInterpretation: HFNO significantly reduced hospital length of stay and ICU re-admissions in high-risk cardiac surgical patients compared to standard oxygen therapy. These findings suggest that HFNO may offer clinical and economic benefits in this patient population.\n\nTrial registration: [Trial registration number]\n\nFunding: [Funding source]",
