Patients were randomised to receive either MB (n=252) or FB (n=255) devices. Randomisation was computer-generated, and allocation was concealed. Patients were blinded to treatment allocation. The primary outcome was the change in WOMAC Index scores over 24 months. Secondary outcomes included SF-12 Health Survey, knee range of motion, and Knee Society scores. Device failures and complications were recorded until October 2009.\n\nResults: No significant differences were observed in mean clinical assessment scores or changes from baseline at any postoperative interval through 2 years. Revision occurred in 19/252 MB and 13/255 FB knees. Estimated 6-year survival was 90.1% (95% CI, 84.1–93.9) for MB and 94.2% (95% CI, 90.1–96.6) for FB. Two MB tibial components were revised for loosening; one MB insert dislocation occurred. Retrieved MB devices showed no unexpected wear.\n\nInterpretation: MB TKA did not demonstrate functional advantages over FB TKA. Survivorship was similar, though follow-up duration was limited.
