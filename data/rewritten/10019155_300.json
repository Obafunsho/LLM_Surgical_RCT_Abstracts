A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Simulation-Based Training for Cerebral Aneurysm Coiling\n\nBackground: This study evaluated the impact of simulation-based training on developing technical skills for cerebral aneurysm coiling among novice medical students.\n\nMethods: Conducted at the University of Western Ontario, this randomised controlled trial included 12 novice medical students with minimal endovascular skills. Participants underwent training using the ANGIO Mentor Express simulator. The intervention consisted of diagnostic cerebral angiography (CA) training followed by aneurysm coiling training over six sessions. The primary outcome was procedural task time, measured over the training period. Randomisation was not applicable as all participants received the intervention. Blinding was not implemented.\n\nResults: All 12 participants completed the study. The average procedural time decreased significantly from 42 to 24 minutes (p < 0.05). Coil success rate improved from 82% to 88%, while coil packing density remained consistent at 30%. Aneurysm perforation rates decreased, but over half of the aneurysms were still perforated by the end of the study. High mental rotation test (MRT) individuals performed faster, but no other MRT-specific changes were observed. No adverse events were reported.\n\nInterpretation: Simulation-based training effectively improved procedural efficiency and coil success rates in novice trainees, although perforation rates remained high. The study underscores the potential of simulation in enhancing technical skills for cerebral aneurysm coiling. Future research should explore methods to further reduce perforation rates and assess the clinical transferability of these skills.\n\nFunding: The study was funded by Oleksiy Zaika, Roy Eagleson, and Sandrine de Ribaupierre.\n\nTrial registration: Not provided.",
