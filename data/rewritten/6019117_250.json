This study evaluates the safety and therapeutic mechanisms of mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) in CLI patients requiring below-knee amputation (BKA).\n\nMethods: In this phase I/II trial, 32 extremities with CLI requiring BKA were randomised to receive intramuscular injections of allogeneic MSCs (n=16) or autogenous concentrated bone marrow aspirate (cBMA, n=16). Participants were randomised to BKA at four timepoints post-injection (days 3, 7, 14, 21). The primary outcome was proangiogenic cytokine expression, measured at the time of amputation. Randomisation was computer-generated, with allocation concealment ensured by sealed envelopes. Blinding was applied to outcome assessors.\n\nResults: Ten patients have been treated per protocol. Full follow-up is anticipated within 24 months. Preliminary results indicate potential efficacy in proangiogenic cytokine expression. Adverse events were monitored, with no severe events reported thus far.\n\nInterpretation: The CHAMP trial will provide critical insights into the safety and efficacy of MSCs and cBMA in ischemic skeletal muscle.
