  "abstract": "1. A 250-word version\n\nBackground: Cyanoacrylate glue closure is a treatment for venous reflux, but specific adverse reactions need further elucidation for better patient selection. This study systematically reviews literature to identify reported reactions and explore their pathophysiology.\n\nMethods: A systematic review was conducted using MeSH terms related to cyanoacrylate and venous diseases, focusing on literature from 2012 to 2022. The search was limited to English reports. Covidence software was used for screening and data extraction, with two reviewers and a content expert as a tiebreaker.\n\nResults: Out of 102 identified reports, 55 were suitable for data extraction. Adverse reactions included phlebitis, hypersensitivity, foreign body granuloma, and endovenous glue-induced thrombosis.\n\nInterpretation: Cyanoacrylate glue is generally safe and effective for treating chronic venous disease, but some adverse events may be specific to the product's properties. Proposed mechanisms for these reactions are based on histologic changes and case examples, though further research is needed.",
