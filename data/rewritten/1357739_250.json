Randomisation was conducted after each center achieved 85% accuracy in SN identification during a 30-case learning phase. The primary outcome was the accuracy of LM/SNB, measured by SN identification rates and nodal metastases incidence, over a recruitment period ending March 31, 2002, with 2001 patients enrolled.\n\nResults: SN identification rate was 95.3% overall. False-negative LM/SNB rates decreased with increasing case volume: 10.3% for the first 25 cases versus 5.2% after 25 cases. Complication rates were 10.1% for LM/SNB, increasing to 37.2% with CLND. No operative mortalities occurred.\n\nInterpretation: LM/SNB is a safe, low-morbidity procedure for staging regional nodal basins in early melanoma. Accuracy improves with experience, supporting its use as standard care. Trial registration and funding details were not provided.",
