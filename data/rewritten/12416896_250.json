This study aimed to evaluate its effectiveness in major surgery.\n\nMethods: This multicenter, double-blinded, placebo-controlled randomised controlled trial was conducted in seven UK NHS hospitals. Adults undergoing major cardiac, thoracic, or abdominal surgery were randomised to receive gabapentin (600 mg preoperatively, 300 mg twice daily for 2 days postoperatively) or placebo. The primary outcome was the length of hospital stay, measured from the end of surgery to discharge. Randomisation was stratified by surgical specialty and site, using a secure internet-based system with permuted blocks. Participants, clinicians, and outcome assessors were blinded. The trial was registered (ISRCTN63614165) and funded by the UK National Institute for Health Research.\n\nResults: Between April 2018 and May 2022, 1,196 participants were randomised (600 gabapentin, 596 placebo). The median hospital stay was similar (gabapentin: 5.94 days; placebo: 6.15 days; hazard ratio: 1.07; 95% CI: 0.95 to 1.20; P = 0.26). Serious adverse events occurred in 189/600 (31.5%) gabapentin and 195/596 (32.7%) placebo participants.\n\nInterpretation: Gabapentin did not significantly alter hospital stay or serious adverse events in major surgery. Further research is needed to explore its role in specific patient subgroups.",
