A 250-word version\n\nTitle: A Randomised Controlled Trial on Fiberoptic Intubation in Simulated Cervical Spine Injury\n\nBackground: This randomised controlled trial aimed to evaluate the efficiency and safety of fiberoptic intubation under different air pressures in patients with simulated cervical spine injury after anesthesia induction.\n\nMethods: Sixty adult patients requiring nasotracheal intubation for oral surgery were randomly assigned to continuous positive-pressure oxygen (CPO), normal-pressure (NS), or intermittent negative-pressure suction (INS) groups. The trial was conducted at the Fourth Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University Medical College. Randomisation was computer-generated, and allocation was concealed in sealed envelopes. The primary outcome was intubation time, measured from bronchoscope insertion to tracheal intubation completion, with a maximum of 180 seconds. Secondary outcomes included intubation success rate, number of attempts, minimum SpO2, and lens contamination rate. Blinding was applied to the outcome assessor.\n\nResults: Fifty-nine patients were analysed. The median intubation time was significantly shorter in the CPO group (59 seconds) compared to the NS (167 seconds) and INS (132.5 seconds) groups (P=0.04). The success rate was higher in the CPO group (94.7%) than in the NS and INS groups (50% each) (P=0.004). Minimum SpO2 was similar across groups, with no significant differences in complications.\n\nInterpretation: CPO via the negative-pressure suction pathway enhances the efficiency and safety of fiberoptic intubation in simulated cervical spine injury.
