A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Hemodynamic and Angiographic Outcomes in the Single Ventricle Reconstruction Trial: A Randomised Controlled Trial\n\nBackground: The Single Ventricle Reconstruction (SVR) trial was conducted to compare interstage cardiac catheterization hemodynamic and angiographic findings between shunt types in infants undergoing the Norwood procedure. \n\nMethods: This multicenter, randomized controlled trial included 549 infants with single ventricle physiology, randomized to receive either a modified Blalock-Taussig shunt (MBTS) or a right ventricle-to-pulmonary artery shunt (RVPAS). Randomization was computer-generated with allocation concealment. Blinding was not applicable. Pre-stage II catheterization data were analyzed for 389 subjects. Hemodynamic variables and angiographic findings were compared between shunt types, and their association with 12-month transplant-free survival was evaluated. \n\nResults: Of the 549 randomized, 389 underwent catheterization. MBTS subjects had lower coronary perfusion pressure (27mmHg vs. 32mmHg, P<0.001) and higher Qp:Qs ratio (1.1 vs. 1.0, P=0.009). Higher Qp:Qs ratio increased the risk of death or transplant in the RVPAS group (P=0.01). MBTS subjects had fewer shunt (14% vs. 28%, P=0.004) and severe left pulmonary artery stenoses (0.7% vs. 9.2%, P=0.003), larger mid-main branch pulmonary artery diameters, and higher Nakata index (164 vs. 134, P<0.001). Adverse events were not reported. \n\nInterpretation: MBTS subjects exhibited more hemodynamic abnormalities, while RVPAS subjects had more severe shunt or pulmonary obstructions and inferior pulmonary artery growth. Lower body surface area, higher ventricular end-diastolic pressure, and lower superior vena cava saturation were associated with worse 12-month transplant-free survival. Trial registration: [Registration number]. Funding: [Source of funding]. The findings highlight the need for tailored management strategies based on shunt type to improve outcomes in this population.",
