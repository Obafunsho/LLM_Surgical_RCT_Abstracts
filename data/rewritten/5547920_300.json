A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Mobile App vs. In-Person Follow-Up Care After Ambulatory Breast Reconstruction: A Randomised Controlled Trial\n\nBackground: In the context of patient-centered care, innovative postoperative care delivery methods are essential.\n\nMethods: This randomised clinical trial was conducted at an academic ambulatory care hospital from February 1 to August 31, 2015. Eligible participants were ambulatory patients undergoing breast reconstruction. Participants were randomly assigned to receive follow-up care via a mobile app or in-person visits during the first 30 days post-operation. The primary outcome was the number of in-person follow-up visits within 30 days. Secondary outcomes included telephone calls, emails to healthcare professionals, patient-reported convenience and satisfaction scores, and complication rates. Randomisation was performed using a computer-generated sequence, and allocation was concealed. The analysis was intention-to-treat.\n\nResults: Sixty-five women were randomised: 32 to the mobile app group and 33 to the in-person group. The mobile app group had fewer in-person visits (mean 0.66 vs. 1.64; difference 0.40; 95% CI, 0.24-0.66; P < .001) and more emails (mean 0.65 vs. 0.15; incidence rate ratio 4.13; 95% CI, 1.55-10.99; P = .005). Convenience scores were higher in the mobile app group (incidence rate ratio 1.39; 95% CI, 1.09-1.77; P = .008). No differences were observed in telephone communications, satisfaction scores, or complication rates. Adverse events were not reported.\n\nInterpretation: Mobile app follow-up care effectively reduces in-person visits without impacting complication rates or satisfaction, enhancing convenience for patients.
