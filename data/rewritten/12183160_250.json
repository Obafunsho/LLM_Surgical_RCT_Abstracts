Eligibility criteria included no previous bleeding disorders and consent to warfarin therapy. The primary outcome was Time in Therapeutic Range (TTR) ≥65%, measured over a median follow-up of 1,749 days. The SAMe-TT2R2 score was used to predict TTR levels. Sensitivity and specificity were calculated for different score cut-offs.\n\nResults: The lowest SAMe-TT2R2 score was 2 points (5.6%), and the highest was 7 points (0.6%). The largest group had 4 points (43.1%). For a cut-off score of ≥4, sensitivity and specificity for predicting TTR ≥65% were 69.8% and 93.1%, respectively. The Area Under the Curve (AUC) was 0.854. No adverse events were reported.\n\nInterpretation: The SAMe-TT2R2 model effectively predicts TTR levels during oral warfarin therapy after mechanical mitral valve replacement. A score ≥4 can predict TTR <65%. The study was not a randomised controlled trial, and no trial registration or funding information is available.",
