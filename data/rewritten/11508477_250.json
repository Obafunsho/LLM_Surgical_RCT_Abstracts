A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Efficacy of Cell Salvage in Cardiac Surgery: A Randomised Controlled Trial\n\nBackground: Cardiac surgery patients are at high risk of bleeding and alterations in biochemical and coagulation parameters. This study evaluates the efficacy of Cell Salvage compared to allogeneic transfusions.\n\nMethods: A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials were conducted. The search included Medline, CINAHL, Scopus, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library. Eligibility criteria included adult participants undergoing cardiac surgery, with studies published in English or Spanish. The primary outcome was the effectiveness of Cell Salvage on hemoglobin levels, measured postoperatively.\n\nResults: Twenty-six studies with 2850 participants (1415 in the Cell Salvage group and 1435 in the control group) were included. Cell Salvage showed moderate evidence of greater effectiveness for hemoglobin (mean difference = 0.48 g/dL, 95% CI 0.28 to 0.69) compared to allogeneic transfusions. However, it did not demonstrate superior outcomes for hemorrhage control, platelet count, fresh frozen plasma, and fibrinogen. No significant adverse events were reported.\n\nInterpretation: Cell Salvage has potential benefits for improving postoperative hemoglobin levels but lacks definitive evidence for other parameters. Further studies are needed to assess its impact on red blood cell count and coagulation patterns. Trial registration: CRD42023446583. Funding: Not specified.",
