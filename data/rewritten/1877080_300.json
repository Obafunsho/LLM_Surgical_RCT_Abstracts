A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Intraoperative Blood Salvage in Liver Resection: A Randomised Controlled Trial\n\nBackground: This randomised controlled trial assessed the effectiveness of intraoperative blood salvage in reducing blood loss during liver resection. Although reducing central venous pressure (CVP) is believed to decrease blood loss, a consistently effective method has not been established.\n\nMethods: Living liver donors scheduled for liver graft procurement were randomly assigned to a blood salvage group or a control group. In the blood salvage group, a blood volume equal to approximately 0.7% of the patient's body weight was collected before liver transection. The primary outcome was blood loss during liver parenchymal division. Randomisation was conducted intraoperatively, and surgeons were blinded to group allocation.\n\nResults: Seventy-nine donors were randomised: 40 to the blood salvage group and 39 to the control group. Blood loss during liver transection was significantly lower in the blood salvage group (median 140 mL) compared to the control group (median 230 mL, P = 0.034). CVP at the beginning of liver parenchymal division was also significantly lower in the blood salvage group (median 5 cm H2O) than in the control group (median 6 cm H2O, P = 0.005). Multivariate analysis revealed that intraoperative blood salvage reduced blood loss (adjusted OR 0.31; 95% CI 0.11–0.85, P = 0.025). No adverse events were reported in either group.\n\nInterpretation: Intraoperative blood salvage significantly reduces blood loss during hepatic parenchymal transection. The study was conducted with a robust randomisation process and blinding of surgeons. Trial registration and funding details are not provided. Further research is needed to confirm these findings and explore the potential for broader application in surgical settings.",
