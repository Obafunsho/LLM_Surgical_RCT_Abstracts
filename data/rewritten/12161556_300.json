Participants were adults scheduled for elective surgery lasting 90-240 minutes. Eligibility criteria included age over 18, fluency in English, and non-cardiac/vascular surgery. Participants were randomised into four groups: (1) CW/CW, (2) FAW/FAW, (3) no active prewarming (NAPW)/CW, and (4) NAPW/FAW. The primary outcome was the area under the temperature curve (AUC) below 36°C, measured intraoperatively using an esophageal probe. Randomisation was performed using a blocked design, and allocation was concealed. Blinding was not applied.\n\nResults: A total of 182 patients were analysed. The CW/CW group had the lowest AUC values, while the NAPW/FAW group had the highest. The mean AUC for CW/CW was 51% lower than NAPW/FAW (ratio 0.49, 95% CI 0.24 to 0.98), and NAPW/CW was 54% lower than NAPW/FAW (ratio 0.46, 95% CI 0.23 to 0.91). When normalised to surgery duration, FAW/FAW had 48% lower relative AUC than NAPW/FAW (p = 0.0419). No significant adverse events were reported.\n\nInterpretation: CW is more effective than FAW in reducing intraoperative hypothermia when FAW is used without prewarming. No difference was observed between CW and FAW when prewarming was applied. Trial registration: ISRCTN23065394. Funding: Not specified.",
