A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of a Patient Decision Aid for Post-Mastectomy Breast Reconstruction\n\nBackground: This randomised controlled trial evaluated the effectiveness of a patient decision aid (pDA) for post-mastectomy breast reconstruction (PMBR) compared to high-quality standard care in reducing decisional conflict.\n\nMethods: Conducted at a large community teaching hospital in the Netherlands, women eligible for PMBR were randomised 1:1 to receive either standard care alone (control) or standard care plus a pDA (intervention). The primary outcome was decisional conflict immediately after reconstructive decision. Secondary outcomes included measures of the decision-making process, patient-reported outcomes, and surgical outcomes. Randomisation was performed using block randomisation with allocation concealment. Blinding was not feasible. A total of 134 participants were randomised between August 2020 and May 2023, with 66 in the intervention group and 68 in the control group. Analysis was conducted on an intention-to-treat basis.\n\nResults: Both groups reported low decisional conflict scores (intervention: 17, control: 20). No significant differences were found in the primary outcome (mean difference = -2.8, 95% CI -8.4 to 2.8, p = 0.319) or secondary outcomes. No adverse events were reported.\n\nInterpretation: In a setting with high-quality multidisciplinary care, the addition of an online pDA for PMBR did not reduce decisional conflict compared to standard care alone. Both approaches effectively supported decision-making. Trial registration: NL-OMON28003 (NTR), NL7939 (NTR-new). Funding: Not specified.",
