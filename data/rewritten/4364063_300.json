A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of ϵ-Aminocaproic Acid Pharmacokinetics in Adolescents Undergoing Spinal Fusion\n\nBackground: ϵ-Aminocaproic acid (EACA) is effective in reducing blood loss in adolescents undergoing spinal fusion, yet pharmacokinetic data specific to this population are absent. This study aimed to elucidate EACA pharmacokinetics and propose dosing recommendations.\n\nMethods: In this randomised controlled trial, 20 adolescents aged 12–17 years undergoing spinal fusion at a tertiary care hospital were enrolled. Participants were randomised into two groups based on scoliosis diagnosis: idiopathic (n=10) and non-idiopathic (n=10). A population non-linear mixed effects modelling approach was employed, integrating data from infants undergoing craniofacial surgery to broaden dosing recommendations across various weights and ages. The primary outcome was the estimation of pharmacokinetic parameters during the surgical period.\n\nResults: A two-compartment model with allometrically scaled weight and age effect on clearance was applied. Pharmacokinetic parameters for a typical patient included plasma clearance of 153 ml min−1 70 kg−1, intercompartmental clearance of 200 ml min−1 70 kg−1, central volume of distribution of 8.78 litre 70 kg−1, and peripheral volume of distribution of 15.8 litre 70 kg−1. Scoliosis aetiology did not significantly impact pharmacokinetics. No adverse events were reported.\n\nInterpretation: Recommended dosing schemes are: for patients <25 kg, a 100 mg kg−1 loading dose and 40 mg kg−1 h−1 infusion; for 25–<50 kg, a 100 mg kg−1 loading dose and 35 mg kg−1 h−1 infusion; and for ≥50 kg, a 100 mg kg−1 loading dose and 30 mg kg−1 h−1 infusion. An efficacy trial using this dosing strategy is warranted. Trial registration: NCT01408823. Funding: Not specified.",
