However, its use may lead to serious hypotension, particularly in patients with hematologic malignancies. This study aimed to identify risk factors associated with this adverse event.\n\nMethods: Conducted at a tertiary hospital from January to December 2023, this retrospective study included hospitalized patients with hematologic malignancies who received intravenous AAP. The serious hypotension group comprised 37 patients, while the control group included 111 patients matched by age and sex. Univariable and multivariable analyses were performed to identify risk factors.\n\nResults: Elevated body temperature prior to administration (OR 9.81, 95% CI 3.49–27.53), acute kidney injury (OR 14.99, 95% CI 3.13–71.87), and bacteremia (OR 6.36, 95% CI 2.01–20.11) were identified as significant risk factors for serious hypotension. An increase of 1 mmHg in mean arterial pressure prior to administration reduced the risk (OR 0.96, 95% CI 0.92–1.00). No significant differences were observed in hospitalization length or 90-day mortality between groups. Adverse events were more frequent in the serious hypotension group, with 64.9% developing septic shock.\n\nInterpretation: Patients with hematologic malignancies and identified risk factors are at increased risk of serious hypotension following intravenous AAP. Close monitoring of blood pressure is essential during administration. Further research is needed to explore the mechanisms and potential biomarkers associated with this adverse event. The study highlights the importance of considering patient-specific factors when administering intravenous AAP to mitigate the risk of serious hypotension.",
