This trial evaluated the effectiveness of decellularized dermis (DCD) allografts as an adjunctive treatment for VLUs.\n\nMethods: This multicentre, open-label, randomised controlled trial was conducted across 17 UK centres. Eligible participants were adults with VLUs ≥3 months and ≥2 cm², with venous incompetence and an ankle-brachial pressure index ≥0.8. Participants were randomised 1:1 to receive either DCD allograft plus standard care or standard care alone. The primary outcome was the proportion of patients with a healed index ulcer at 12 weeks. Randomisation was automated, and outcome assessors were blinded.\n\nResults: From October 2019 to October 2022, 71 participants were randomised (36 to intervention, 35 to control). Healing occurred in 5.7% of the intervention group and 15.2% of the control group (OR 0.34, 95% CI 0.03 to 2.31). No significant differences were observed in secondary outcomes. Five serious adverse events were attributed to DCD. The trial was terminated early due to low healing rates.\n\nInterpretation: DCD allografts did not improve VLU healing rates, and important clinical benefits or harms could not be excluded due to early termination and small sample size.\n\nTrial registration: ISRCTN 21541209\n\nFunding: JP Moulton Charitable Trust",
