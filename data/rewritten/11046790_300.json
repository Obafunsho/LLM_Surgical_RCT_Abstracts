Currently, approved drugs are primarily for hereditary angioedema (HAE), but there is increasing interest in developing new drug candidates for broader indications.\n\nMethods: A two-stage literature search was conducted from March to December 2023 to identify drug candidates targeting the KKS. The search utilized PubMed, Clinicaltrials.gov, and Google Scholar. Identified drugs were categorized by target, development stage, and intended indication. The primary outcome was the identification of promising drug candidates for emerging indications.\n\nResults: The search identified 68 drugs: 10 approved, 25 in clinical development, and 33 in preclinical development. The most studied indications were diabetic retinopathy, thromboprophylaxis, and HAE. Among the emerging indications, ixodes ricinus-contact phase inhibitor is in phase 2 for thromboprophylaxis, and RZ402 and THR-149 are in phase 2 for diabetic macular edema. The study did not report adverse events or harm associated with the drug candidates.\n\nInterpretation: The therapeutic potential of targeting the KKS extends beyond HAE, with ongoing research demonstrating potential benefits for other diseases. This study underscores the expanding scope of therapeutic interventions targeting the KKS, offering future treatment options for patients. The findings suggest that the KKS could be a promising target for developing new therapies for diseases lacking optimal treatment strategies.\n\nTrial registration: Not applicable.\n\nFunding: Not specified.",
