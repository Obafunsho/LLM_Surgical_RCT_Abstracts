A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Fibrin Glue Sealant in Liver Resection\n\nBackground: Fibrin sealants are used to enhance perioperative hemostasis and reduce biliary leakage in liver surgery, but evidence from high-quality trials is limited.\n\nMethods: This randomised controlled trial included 300 patients undergoing hepatic resection, randomly assigned to either fibrin glue application or control groups. The primary outcome was the amount of blood loss, measured intraoperatively. Secondary outcomes included transfusion requirements, biliary fistula incidence, and postoperative complications. Randomisation was performed using a computer-generated sequence, with allocation concealment ensured by sealed envelopes. Blinding was applied to outcome assessors.\n\nResults: A total of 150 patients were randomised to each group. Analysis was conducted on an intention-to-treat basis. No significant differences were observed in transfusion requirements (0.15 ± 0.66 vs. 0.17 ± 0.63 PRCU; P = 0.7234) or in the percentage of patients requiring transfusion (18% vs. 12%; P = 0.2). Drainage volumes (1180 ± 2528 vs. 960 ± 1253 mL) and days of postoperative drainage (7.9 ± 5 vs. 7.1 ± 4.7) were similar. Biliary fistula incidence was comparable (10% vs. 11%), as was postoperative morbidity (23% vs. 23%; P = 1). No significant adverse events were reported.\n\nInterpretation: Fibrin sealant application in liver resection does not reduce blood loss, transfusion needs, or biliary fistula incidence compared to controls. Routine use is not justified and discontinuation could lead to cost savings.\n\nTrial registration: [Trial registration number]\n\nFunding: [Source of funding]",
