A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Adherence to Prehabilitation in Randomised Controlled Trials: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis\n\nBackground: Prehabilitation is hypothesized to enhance postoperative outcomes, yet achieving high adherence is challenging. This study aimed to synthesize adherence measurement and reporting, estimate adherence rates, identify factors associated with adherence, and report barriers and facilitators.\n\nMethods: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) involving adults undergoing major elective surgery and allocated to prehabilitation programs. Searches were conducted in Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Web of Science, and Cochrane CENTRAL until April 10, 2024. The primary outcome was adherence to prehabilitation, measured continuously or dichotomously. Random-effects meta-analysis and meta-regression were used to evaluate adherence rates and predictors. Qualitative synthesis was informed by the Theoretical Domains Framework.\n\nResults: We screened 11,652 titles and abstracts, followed by 1,232 full texts, and included 105 RCTs (n=4941 participants). Pooled adherence was 79% (95% CI 70–88; I²=95.4%). Only patient age was significantly associated with adherence (OR 0.95 per year older, 95% CI 0.91–0.99). Common barriers included logistical issues and health conditions, while facilitators included supervision by specialists and personalisation. No adverse events were reported.\n\nInterpretation: Adherence to prehabilitation is variable across trials, necessitating standardisation in reporting and interpretation. Age was the only significant predictor of adherence, but qualitative insights into barriers and facilitators can inform program design and implementation. The study was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42024518851) and funded by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research. The findings underscore the need for consistent adherence reporting and highlight the potential of qualitative insights to enhance prehabilitation program design.",
