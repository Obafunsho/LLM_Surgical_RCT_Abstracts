A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Revascularization vs. Non-Operative Management in Intermittent Claudication\n\nBackground: The Society for Vascular Surgery recommends revascularization for intermittent claudication (IC) to improve function and quality of life, yet its benefits over medical management remain unclear.\n\nMethods: This randomised controlled trial was conducted at an academic medical center from 2016 to 2021. Eligible IC patients were randomised to either revascularization (bypass or PVI) or non-operative management (medication and exercise therapy). The primary outcome was patient-reported physical function (PROMIS-PF) and satisfaction in social roles (PROMIS-SA) over a follow-up of up to 7 years. Randomisation was computer-generated, with allocation concealment ensured. Blinding was not applicable due to the nature of interventions.\n\nResults: A total of 225 patients were randomised: 89 to revascularization and 136 to non-operative management. Analysis was conducted using a linear mixed-effect model adjusted for covariates. No significant differences were found in PROMIS-PF between groups over time (P=0.07). PROMIS-SA improved significantly in all patients (P=0.019), with greater improvement in the non-operative group (P=0.045). No adverse events were reported.\n\nInterpretation: Both revascularization and non-operative management yield similar long-term functional outcomes in IC patients. Non-operative management may offer better satisfaction in social roles, supporting conservative treatment.\n\nTrial registration: [Trial registration number]\n\nFunding: [Source of funding]",
