The sample size was calculated to ensure sufficient power to detect differences in PPCs. Participants were randomly assigned to either the intervention group, receiving enhanced neuromuscular monitoring and management, or the control group, receiving standard care. Randomisation was achieved using a computer-generated sequence, with allocation concealment ensured through sealed envelopes. Blinding was applied to outcome assessors, patients, and clinicians.\n\nResults: A total of 200 participants were randomised, with 100 in each group, between January 2020 and June 2021. The primary outcome was the incidence of PPCs within 30 days post-surgery. Analysis was conducted on 98 participants in the intervention group and 97 in the control group using an intention-to-treat approach. The intervention group showed a significant reduction in PPCs (mean difference = 5.2%, 95% CI 3.1 to 7.3; p = 0.01). Adverse events were reported in 3% of the intervention group and 1% of the control group, with mild gastrointestinal side-effects being the most common.\n\nInterpretation: Enhanced neuromuscular monitoring and management significantly reduce PPCs compared to standard care. The study underscores the importance of appropriate NMB management in surgical patients and suggests that improvements in neuromuscular monitoring interpretation may further decrease PPC incidence.\n\nTrial registration: [Trial registration number]\n\nFunding: This trial was funded by [source of funding].",
