This study evaluates the efficacy of polyhexamethylene biguanide (PHMB)-impregnated gauze compared to plain gauze in reducing pin tract infections.\n\nMethods: This randomised controlled trial included 38 patients (40 limbs) undergoing limb lengthening or deformity correction with external fixators at a single center between July 2009 and June 2010. Participants were randomly assigned to either the PHMB group (22 limbs) or the control group (18 limbs). The primary outcome was the rate of pin tract infection, assessed at 2, 4, 8, and 12 weeks post-surgery using a predetermined grading system. Randomisation was performed using a computer-generated sequence, and allocation was concealed. The outcome assessor was blinded to group allocation.\n\nResults: A total of 1932 observations were made across 483 metal-skin interfaces. The infection rate was significantly lower in the PHMB group (1.0%) compared to the control group (4.5%), with a relative risk of 0.228 (95% CI, 0.118 to 0.443; p < 0.001). No adverse events were reported in either group.\n\nInterpretation: PHMB-impregnated gauze significantly reduces the risk of pin tract infection in patients undergoing external fixation. This intervention could be considered a standard practice to minimize infection rates.\n\nTrial registration: Not provided.\n\nFunding: Not disclosed.",
