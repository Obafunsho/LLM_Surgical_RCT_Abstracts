Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to IBBR with or without ADM. The primary outcome was the number of reoperations within 6 months. Secondary outcomes included HRQoL and cosmetic outcomes, assessed using EORTC-QLQC30, QLQ-BR23, and QLQ-BRR26 questionnaires. Randomisation was computer-generated, and allocation was concealed until baseline questionnaires were completed. The study was open-label.\n\nResults: From April 2014 to May 2017, 135 women were randomised: 65 to ADM and 70 to control. Analysis included 64 in the ADM group and 65 in the control group. At 6 months, HRQoL scores were similar between groups. Cosmetic outcomes showed small differences favoring ADM in two subscales: cosmetic outcome (mean difference 8.66, 95% CI 0.46 to 16.86; p = 0.041) and problems finding a well-fitting bra (mean difference -13.21, 95% CI -25.54 to -0.89; p = 0.038). Adverse events requiring reoperation were more frequent in the ADM group.\n\nInterpretation: IBBR with ADM did not significantly improve HRQoL compared to IBBR without ADM. Minor cosmetic benefits were observed with ADM. Trial registration: NCT02061527. Funding: Not specified.",
