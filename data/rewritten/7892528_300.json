A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of SGM-101 for Intraoperative Fluorescence Imaging in Colorectal Cancer\n\nBackground: Carcinoembryonic antigen is overexpressed in colorectal cancer (CRC), making it an optimal target for fluorescence imaging. This study aimed to determine the optimal imaging dose of SGM-101 for intraoperative fluorescence imaging of primary and recurrent CRC.\n\nMethods: This ascending dose, exploratory study was conducted in the Netherlands, involving 37 patients with primary or recurrent CRC. Patients received a single dose of SGM-101 (5 mg, 7.5 mg, 10 mg, 12.5 mg, or 15 mg) intravenously at least 24 hours before surgery. A dedicated near-infrared imaging system was used for real-time fluorescence imaging during surgery. Safety assessments and efficacy evaluations were performed per dose level.\n\nResults: From January 2016 to January 2019, 37 patients were included. Fluorescence was visible in all primary and recurrent tumors, except in seven patients with pathological complete responses. Two tumors showed false-positive fluorescence. A total of 97 lesions were excised. The highest mean intraoperative tumor-to-background ratio (TBR) of 1.9 (p = 0.019) was observed at the 10 mg dose, which showed a sensitivity of 96%, specificity of 63%, and negative predictive value of 94%. Nine patients (24%) had surgical plan alterations based on fluorescence, with additional malignant lesions detected in six patients. All doses up to 15 mg were well tolerated, with no adverse events directly related to SGM-101.\n\nInterpretation: The optimal imaging dose was established at 10 mg administered 4 days before surgery. SGM-101 demonstrated potential for improving surgical outcomes in CRC by identifying additional malignant lesions. The study is registered under ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT02973672 and was funded by the Centre for Human Drug Research. These findings provide a promising basis for the ongoing multinational phase III study.",
