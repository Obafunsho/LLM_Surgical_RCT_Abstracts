  "abstract": "Title: The iPREDICT Study: A Randomised Controlled Trial on Interactive Consultation Tool for Anaesthesia Risk Education\n\nBackground: The iPREDICT study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of an interactive consultation tool (ICT) in enhancing patient awareness of anaesthesia-related risks during preoperative anaesthetic assessment (PAA).\n\nMethods: This prospective, single-centre, randomised, placebo-controlled trial was conducted at the University Hospital Bonn, Germany, from September 2023 to January 2025. Eligible participants were adults scheduled for elective surgery under general or combined anaesthesia. Participants were randomised 1:1 to receive either ICT-based online anaesthesia risk education (intervention) or a control video without anaesthetic risk content. Both groups underwent a face-to-face PAA. The primary outcome was the perioperative risk knowledge score, assessed immediately after PAA and two days later. Randomisation was performed using a cryptographically secure pseudo-random number generator, with allocation concealed within the software. Blinding was not feasible for patients or clinicians.\n\nResults: A total of 373 participants were randomised (186 to ICT, 187 to control), with 315 completing the online module. Analysis included 275 participants (139 ICT, 136 control) using a per-protocol approach. The ICT group demonstrated a higher median risk knowledge score post-PAA (13.0 vs. 11.0, p < 0.05) and further improvement at follow-up (14.0 vs. 13.0, p < 0.05). No adverse events were reported. \n\nTrial registration: DRKS00032514.\n\nFunding: The study was funded by the University Hospital Bonn.\n\n---\n\nTitle: The iPREDICT Study: A Randomised Controlled Trial on Interactive Consultation Tool for Anaesthesia Risk Education\n\nBackground: The iPREDICT study investigated the feasibility and effectiveness of an interactive consultation tool (ICT) in improving patient understanding of anaesthesia-related risks during preoperative anaesthetic assessment (PAA).\n\nMethods: Conducted at the University Hospital Bonn, Germany, this prospective, single-centre, randomised, placebo-controlled trial ran from September 2023 to January 2025.

No adverse events were reported.\n\nInterpretation: The ICT significantly enhanced patients' knowledge of anaesthesia-related risks, suggesting that interactive education tools are effective in improving perioperative risk understanding. This approach may contribute to better patient outcomes and should be explored in future studies.\n\nTrial registration: DRKS00032514.\n\nFunding: The study was funded by the University Hospital Bonn.",
