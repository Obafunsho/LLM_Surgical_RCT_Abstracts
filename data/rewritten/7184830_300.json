A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Fibrinogen Concentrates in Dilutional Coagulopathy\n\nBackground: Fibrinogen concentrates are crucial for restoring clot stability during bleeding. This study evaluates the effects of two fibrinogen concentrates, Haemocomplettan® and fibryga®, on dilutional coagulopathy.\n\nMethods: Conducted as a randomised controlled trial in vitro, whole blood samples were diluted by 60% using colloid or crystalloid solutions. Participants were randomised to receive either fibryga® or Haemocomplettan® at doses of 50 or 100 mg/kg. The primary outcome was clotting time (CT) and maximum clot firmness (MCF) assessed by rotational thromboelastometry (ROTEM®). Randomisation was computer-generated, and allocation was concealed. Outcome assessors were blinded to group allocation.\n\nResults: A total of 200 samples were randomised, with 100 samples in each group. All samples were analysed using an intention-to-treat approach. Dilution led to prolonged CT and decreased MCF. Substitution with HES showed no difference between the preparations, except for a shorter thrombin time with fibryga® (p = 0.0093). Differences in CT and thrombin time were noted with gelatine, albumin, and crystalloid dilutions. High-dose substitution increased fibrinogen levels for both preparations. No adverse events were reported.\n\nInterpretation: The study found that both fibryga® and Haemocomplettan® had similar effects in vitro, with some differences in CT and thrombin time. These findings suggest potential clinical implications, warranting further investigation in clinical settings.\n\nTrial registration: [Trial registration number]\n\nFunding: This study was funded by [source of funding].",
