A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Intraperitoneal Hyperthermic Chemoperfusion with Oxaliplatin for Peritoneal Surface Malignancy\n\nBackground: Cytoreductive surgery with intraperitoneal hyperthermic chemoperfusion (IPHC) is a promising approach for peritoneal surface malignancy. This study aimed to establish the dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of oxaliplatin in IPHC for colorectal and appendiceal cancer dissemination.\n\nMethods: This phase I trial was conducted at [study setting]. Eligible participants were adults with peritoneal dissemination from colorectal or appendiceal cancers. Cohorts of three patients underwent cytoreductive surgery followed by a 2-hour IPHC with escalating doses of oxaliplatin, starting at 200 mg/m² with 50 mg/m² increments. The primary outcome was DLT, defined as grade 3 toxicity lasting 5 days. Randomisation and allocation concealment methods were not applicable. Blinding was not implemented.\n\nResults: Fifteen patients were enrolled at two dose levels. Peritoneal fluid AUCs exceeded plasma levels, and intratumoral oxaliplatin was similar to surrounding normal tissue. DLTs at 250 mg/m² were observed in two of three patients. The MTD was determined to be 200 mg/m². Adverse events were significant at 250 mg/m², precluding higher doses.\n\nInterpretation: IPHC with 200 mg/m² oxaliplatin is well tolerated and represents the MTD for a 2-hour chemoperfusion. Further studies are warranted at this dose. Trial registration: [Trial registration number]. Funding: [Source of funding].",
