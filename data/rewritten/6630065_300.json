The studies compared patients compliant with imaging surveillance protocols to those who were partially or noncompliant. The primary outcome was the reintervention rate, and the secondary outcome was all-cause mortality, both measured over a median follow-up of 31.7 months. The review protocol was registered at PROSPERO (CRD42017080494).\n\nResults: The overall reintervention rate was 5%, with a risk difference (RD) of 4% (95% CI 1% to 7%) favoring partial/noncompliance, indicating a number needed to harm of 25 (95% CI 14 to 100). The overall mortality rate was 31%, with a nonsignificant RD of 12% (95% CI −2% to 26%) in favor of partial/noncompliance. Two studies reported that 41% to 53% of reinterventions were due to complications detected through imaging surveillance, while others were detected through patient symptoms.\n\nInterpretation: The findings suggest that compliance with imaging surveillance after EVAR results in more reinterventions without a corresponding reduction in mortality. This indicates that the current recommendation for yearly imaging surveillance may not be universally beneficial for all EVAR patients. The study underscores the importance of developing a more individualized approach to post-EVAR surveillance, potentially reducing unnecessary interventions and associated complications.\n\nTrial registration: PROSPERO CRD42017080494\n\nFunding: Not specified.",
