Methods: A comprehensive literature review was conducted, focusing on guidelines published in English from 2002 to 2022. The search included databases such as Scopus, Medline, Embase, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library, using key terms like difficult airway, cesarean section, obstetrics, guidelines, and algorithms. Results: Four articles detailing airway management guidelines in obstetrics were identified and analyzed. These guidelines address procedures for difficult facemask ventilation, the use of supraglottic devices, difficult endotracheal intubation, and emergency cricothyrotomy or tracheotomy when oxygenation and ventilation are impossible. The guidelines also describe decision-making strategies and necessary equipment for each variant of difficult airway management. Interpretation: The study highlights the importance of modern algorithms in managing difficult airways in pregnant women, emphasizing the need for appropriate equipment and experience in obstetric departments. Croatian anesthesiologists can adopt and adapt these guidelines from developed countries into daily practice and training curricula for residents. The study underscores the necessity of strict adherence to these guidelines to improve patient safety and outcomes in obstetric anesthesia. The findings suggest that implementing these guidelines can enhance the management of difficult airways, reduce morbidity and mortality associated with general anesthesia for cesarean sections, and ensure better preparedness for unexpected airway challenges. The study calls for continuous education and training for anesthesiologists to maintain high standards of care in obstetric anesthesia.",
