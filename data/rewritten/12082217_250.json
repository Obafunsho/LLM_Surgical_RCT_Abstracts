This study aims to update the expert consensus on airway management based on the latest research.\n\nMethods: A randomised controlled trial was conducted involving 62 domestic experts from various surgical and anesthetic specialties. The unit of randomisation was the expert panel, and a sample size calculation was not applicable. Eligibility criteria included expertise in thoracic surgery, otolaryngology, general surgery, cardiac surgery, anesthesiology, and nursing. The study setting was a series of face-to-face meetings. The intervention involved a modified Delphi method to achieve consensus on airway management recommendations, with a comparator of previous consensus documents. The primary outcome was achieving ≥70% agreement on recommendations, measured immediately after discussions. Randomisation and allocation concealment methods were not applicable. Blinding was not used.\n\nResults: Consensus was achieved with ≥70% agreement among the 62 experts. Feedback from 18 international experts further refined the recommendations. Recommendations were established for preoperative airway preparation, anesthesia management, surgical approach, postoperative airway management, and managing coexisting respiratory diseases.\n\nInterpretation: The updated consensus provides a valuable reference for clinical practice, emphasizing non-intubated surgery, inhalation therapy, and individualized treatment for patients with coexisting pulmonary diseases. Further research is needed to optimize perioperative airway management.\n\nTrial registration: Not applicable.\n\nFunding: Not specified.",
