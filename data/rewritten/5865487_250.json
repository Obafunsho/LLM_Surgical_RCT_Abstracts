  "abstract": "Title: A Randomised Controlled Trial Comparing Superficial Surgical Site Infection Rates Between Delayed Primary and Primary Wound Closure for Complicated Appendicitis\n\nBackground: Superficial surgical site infection (SSI) is a common complication in appendectomy for complicated appendicitis. This study aimed to compare SSI rates between delayed primary wound closure (DPC) and primary wound closure (PC).\n\nMethods: A multicenter randomised controlled trial was conducted in six hospitals in Thailand from November 2012 to February 2016. Participants were adults with gangrenous or ruptured appendicitis. They were randomised to either PC or DPC. The primary outcome was the rate of superficial SSI within 30 days, defined by the Center for Disease Control criteria. Secondary outcomes included postoperative pain, length of stay, recovery time, quality of life, and cost of treatment. Randomisation was performed using permuted blocks, and allocation was concealed in sealed opaque envelopes. Blinding was applied to research assistants assessing subjective outcomes.\n\nResults: A total of 607 patients were randomised, with 303 to PC and 304 to DPC. Modified intention-to-treat analysis included 300 in PC and 298 in DPC. The SSI rate was 7.3% in PC and 10% in DPC, with a risk difference of −2.7% (95% CI −7.1% to 1.9%), not statistically significant. Costs were significantly lower for PC by 2083 Baht. No severe adverse events were reported.\n\nInterpretation: PC resulted in slightly lower SSI rates and significantly lower costs compared to DPC, although the difference in SSI rates was not statistically significant. Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov ID NCT01659983. Funding: Not specified.",
