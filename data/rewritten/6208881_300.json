Participants underwent PLA, followed by a 28-day post-ablation MRI and surgical resection. The primary outcome was complete tumor ablation, evaluated by pathology. Cell viability was assessed using H&E, CK8/18, ER, and Ki67 staining. Randomisation and blinding were not applicable.\n\nResults: Between June 2012 and May 2015, 61 patients were treated. Complete tumor ablation was confirmed in 51 (84%) patients. MRI-pathology correlation was evaluable in 60 patients, with an MRI negative predictive value of 92.2% (95% CI, 71.9–91.9%). Of the 47 patients with tumors ≤15 mm, 46 were completely ablated, with an MRI NPV of 97.7% (95% CI, 86.2–99.9%). Adverse events were mild to moderate, with no serious events reported. Eight mild events included lump, blister, hematoma, erythema, and fat necrosis, while six moderate events included pain, lump, and seroma.\n\nInterpretation: PLA demonstrates potential as an alternative to surgery for early-stage IDC, with strong MRI-pathology correlation. Further trials are necessary to validate these findings and explore PLA efficacy without subsequent surgical resection.\n\nTrial registration: Not provided.\n\nFunding: Not specified.",
