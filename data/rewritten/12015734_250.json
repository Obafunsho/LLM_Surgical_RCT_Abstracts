This study evaluates a novel leukocyte remover to mitigate these effects.\n\nMethods: This substudy within a registered clinical trial (NCT05400356) involved seven patients undergoing CPB at West China Hospital, Sichuan University. The intervention was a disposable leukocyte remover with an RGD peptide-coated membrane, integrated into an extracorporeal circuit. Blood was circulated for 10 minutes at 300 mL/min. Leukocyte counts and activation markers were assessed at baseline and after 2.5, 5, 7.5, and 10 minutes. The primary outcome was the reduction in activated neutrophils, measured over 10 minutes. Randomisation and blinding details were not applicable.\n\nResults: Neutrophil counts and those expressing CD11b, CD54, CD64, or CD181 decreased by 36–39% within 2.5 minutes, with slower declines thereafter. Monocyte and lymphocyte counts remained stable. The membrane retained intact activated leukocytes, confirmed by immunostaining and electron microscopy. No significant changes in leukocyte morphology were observed.\n\nInterpretation: The leukocyte remover effectively reduces activated neutrophils in ex vivo blood, with minimal impact on other leukocytes and blood components. Further studies are warranted.\n\nTrial Registration: NCT05400356\n\nFunding: Not specified.",
