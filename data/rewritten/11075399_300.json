Eligibility criteria included histologically confirmed colorectal adenocarcinoma with inoperable hepatic metastases and critical limb ischemia with no option but amputation. The primary outcome for chemotherapy was partial response or stable disease over a mean survival of 11.2 months. For peripheral vascular disease, the primary outcome was avoidance of major amputation over a mean follow-up of 22 months. The trial was registered (ACTRN12611001273976) and approved by the institution’s Human Ethics Committee.\n\nResults: In the chemotherapy group, six out of ten patients achieved partial response or stable disease. In the peripheral vascular disease group, 40% avoided amputation, and 20% experienced a delay of 4 months. Adverse events included a 4% infection rate and one minor thromboembolic event without residua.\n\nInterpretation: The access system facilitates repeatable multi-catheter arterial access for chemotherapy, addressing challenges of concentration, dilution, and microvascular control. It supports extracorporeal arterial-to-arterial access, generating flows greater than 1 L/min with zero flow between treatments. The device logistics compare favorably with arteriovenous and venovenous access systems, offering a potential alternative for patients with limited treatment options. The study provides a basis for future trials to further evaluate the clinical efficacy and safety of this system.",
