Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is linked to endothelial injury and AVF failure. This study investigates whether inhibiting endothelial TGF-β signaling can prevent AVF failure by reducing endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EndMT).\n\nMethods: This randomised controlled trial involved C57BL/6J mice subjected to 5/6 nephrectomy to induce CKD, with 0/6 and 3/6 nephrectomy as controls. AVF were created in mice with TGF-βR1/R2 knockdown in endothelial or smooth muscle cells. Randomisation was performed using a computer-generated sequence, and allocation was concealed. The primary outcome was AVF patency, assessed over 42 days. Blinding was applied to outcome assessors.\n\nResults: 120 mice were randomised: 60 to the intervention and 60 to the control group. CKD accelerated TGF-β activation and EndMT, increasing AVF wall thickness and reducing patency. Inhibition of TGF-β signaling decreased smooth muscle cell proliferation, reduced wall thickness, and improved AVF patency. No adverse events were reported.\n\nInterpretation: Inhibiting TGF-β signaling, particularly in endothelial cells, attenuates EndMT and enhances AVF patency in CKD. This approach may have translational significance for improving AVF outcomes in human CKD patients.\n\nTrial registration: Not provided.\n\nFunding: Supported by NIH grants R01-HL128406, R01-HL144476, R01-HL162580, R01-HL152197, R01-HL146723, R01-HL155105, China Scholarship Council, and VA Connecticut Healthcare System.",
