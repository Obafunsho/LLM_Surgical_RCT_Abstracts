A 300-word version\n\nTitle: A Multicentre Randomised Controlled Trial Comparing Olanexidine and Chlorhexidine-Alcohol for Surgical-Site Antisepsis\n\nBackground: Surgical-site infections (SSIs) are prevalent in clean-contaminated surgeries, necessitating effective antiseptic strategies. This study aimed to compare the efficacy of aqueous olanexidine with chlorhexidine-alcohol in preventing SSIs.\n\nMethods: This multicentre, randomised, open-label, blinded-endpoint controlled trial was conducted across five Japanese hospitals. Eligible participants were adults undergoing elective clean-contaminated gastrointestinal and hepatobiliary-pancreatic surgeries. The primary outcome was the 30-day SSI rate. Randomisation was achieved using a web-based system with block randomisation, and allocation was concealed. Outcome assessors were blinded to group allocation.\n\nResults: From January 2023 to November 2023, 700 patients were randomised: 350 to the olanexidine group and 350 to the chlorhexidine-alcohol group. In the full analysis set, 347 patients in the olanexidine group and 345 in the chlorhexidine-alcohol group were analysed. The 30-day SSI rate was 12.3% in the olanexidine group and 13.6% in the chlorhexidine-alcohol group (adjusted risk ratio 0.911, 95% CI 0.625 to 1.327; P = 0.626). Secondary outcomes, including the occurrence of superficial incisional SSI, deep incisional SSI, organ/space SSI, and reoperation due to SSI, showed no significant differences between groups. Adverse effects were reported in 0.6% of the olanexidine group and 0.9% of the chlorhexidine-alcohol group.\n\nInterpretation: Olanexidine did not significantly reduce the occurrence of SSIs compared with chlorhexidine-alcohol, but it demonstrated comparable efficacy. These findings suggest that olanexidine can be considered an alternative antiseptic in clean-contaminated surgeries, particularly when alcohol-based solutions are contraindicated.\n\nTrial registration: UMIN 000049712.\n\nFunding: The study was independently conducted by Keio University.",
