A 250-word version\n\nTitle: A Randomised Controlled Trial of Bilateral Deep Brain Stimulation of the Fornix in Mild, Probable Alzheimer’s Disease\n\nBackground: This study evaluates the safety, efficacy, and tolerability of bilateral deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the fornix in patients with mild, probable Alzheimer’s disease (AD).\n\nMethods: The ADvance Trial is a multicenter, 12-month, double-blind, randomised, controlled feasibility study. Participants were patients with mild, probable AD, recruited between June 6, 2012, and April 28, 2014. The primary outcome was the 90-day perioperative safety of the procedure. Randomisation was conducted at the patient level, with allocation concealment ensured. Blinding was maintained for outcome assessors, patients, and clinicians. All patients underwent postoperative MRI, and stereotactic analyses were performed in a blinded fashion.\n\nResults: A total of 42 patients were randomised to receive bilateral fornix DBS. The mean age was 68.2 years, with 23 men and 19 women. The mean length of hospitalisation was 1.4 days. Twenty-six patients (61.9%) experienced 64 adverse events (AEs) related to the study procedure, with 7 serious AEs in 5 patients (11.9%). Four patients required return to surgery. No neurological deficits or deaths were reported.\n\nInterpretation: Accurate targeting of DBS to the fornix is feasible across surgeons and treatment centers. At 90 days post-surgery, bilateral fornix DBS was well tolerated in patients with mild, probable AD. Trial registration: [Trial registration number]. Funding: [Source of funding].",
