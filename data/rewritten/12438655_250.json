A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Neoadjuvant Targeted Therapy in EGFR-Mutant Resectable Lung Adenocarcinoma\n\nBackground: This study evaluates the efficacy and safety of neoadjuvant targeted therapy in patients with EGFR-mutant resectable lung adenocarcinoma.\n\nMethods: A multicenter retrospective analysis was conducted on 24 patients with stage IIA-IIIB EGFR-mutant lung adenocarcinoma treated with neoadjuvant targeted therapy followed by surgery from July 2019 to October 2024. The primary outcome was the objective response rate (ORR) measured post-treatment. Secondary outcomes included major pathologic response (MPR) and adverse events. \n\nResults: All 24 patients underwent successful R0 resection. The ORR was 83.3% (20/24), and the MPR was 37.5% (9/24), with 2 patients achieving pathological complete response (pCR). During neoadjuvant therapy, 54.2% (13/24) experienced grade 1-2 adverse events, with no grade 3 or higher events reported. Rash (16.7%), oral ulcers (8.3%), and diarrhea (8.3%) were the most common adverse events. The median follow-up was 33 months, with a 100% overall survival rate and disease-free survival rates of 91.1% at 1 year and 86.2% at 2 years.\n\nInterpretation: Neoadjuvant targeted therapy is a safe and feasible option for EGFR-mutant resectable lung adenocarcinoma, showing promising efficacy and manageable safety profiles. Further randomized controlled trials are needed to confirm these findings.",
