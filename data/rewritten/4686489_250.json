A 250-word version\n\nTitle: A Randomised Controlled Trial Comparing Patient-Specific Instrumentation with Conventional Techniques in Unicompartmental Knee Arthroplasty\n\nBackground: Component alignment in unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA) can affect implant longevity, pain, and function. This study evaluates whether patient-specific instrumentation (PSI) improves outcomes compared to conventional techniques.\n\nMethods: In this randomised controlled trial, 60 patients with a mean age of 63 years (range 54–72) and mean BMI of 28 kg/m² were randomised to receive UKA using either PSI or conventional instrumentation. The primary outcome was gait parameters assessed with three-dimensional analysis at 1 year. Secondary outcomes included implant positioning on radiographs at 3 months and patient-reported outcomes at 3 months and 1 year. Randomisation was performed using a computer-generated sequence, and allocation was concealed. Outcome assessors were blinded to the intervention.\n\nResults: At 1 year, no significant differences were observed in gait parameters between the PSI and conventional groups: double limb support (31% vs. 30%; p = 0.67) and walking speed (1.59 m/s vs. 1.57 m/s; p = 0.41). Implant positioning and functional scores (KSS) were similar between groups at 3 months and 1 year. No adverse events were reported.\n\nInterpretation: PSI does not confer significant advantages in alignment, pain, or function over conventional techniques in UKA. The additional cost and uncertainty of PSI may not be justified.\n\nTrial registration: [Trial registration number]\n\nFunding: [Source of funding]",
