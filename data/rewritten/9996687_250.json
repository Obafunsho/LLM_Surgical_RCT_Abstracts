A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Embolic Protection Devices in Surgical Aortic Valve Replacement\n\nBackground: Stroke and delirium are common complications following surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) and may impact post-discharge cognition and patient-centered health outcomes.\n\nMethods: In this randomised controlled trial, 383 patients undergoing SAVR, with 41% receiving concomitant coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), were enrolled to assess the efficacy of embolic protection devices. Participants were evaluated for neurological and delirium outcomes on post-operative days 1, 3, and 7, and underwent MRI on day 7. The primary outcome was 90-day functional status, neurocognitive decline from pre-surgical baseline, and quality of life (QoL). Randomisation was conducted using a computer-generated sequence, and allocation was concealed. Outcome assessors were blinded to group assignments.\n\nResults: By day 7, 25 (6.6%) patients experienced stroke, and 103 (28.5%) had delirium. Stroke was associated with longer hospital stays (HR 0.62; 95% CI 0.42–0.94; p=0.02) and poorer outcomes at 90 days, including higher modified Rankin scores (OR 5.9; 95% CI 1.7–20.1; p=0.01), depression (OR 5.3; 95% CI 1.6–17.3; p=0.006), and neurocognitive decline (OR 7.8; 95% CI 2.3–26.4; p=0.001). Delirium was linked to depression (OR 2.2; 95% CI 0.9–5.3; p=0.08) and neurocognitive decline (OR 2.2; 95% CI 1.2–4.0; p=0.01).\n\nInterpretation: Stroke and delirium significantly affect post-operative outcomes in SAVR patients, highlighting the need for interventions to mitigate these complications.
