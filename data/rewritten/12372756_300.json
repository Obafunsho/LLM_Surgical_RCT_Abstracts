The primary outcome was postoperative mortality, measured over the short-term period. Secondary outcomes included morbidity, all-cause survival, freedom from aortic-related survival, and freedom from aortic-related re-intervention. Data were extracted independently by two authors. Randomisation and allocation concealment methods were not applicable as this was a meta-analysis. Blinding was not performed.\n\nResults: Endovascular repair was associated with significantly lower postoperative mortality (OR: 0.57, 95% CI: 0.45-0.72) and morbidity. In terms of long-term outcomes, endovascular repair showed better freedom from aortic-related survival (HR: 0.71, 95% CI: 0.54-0.93) but inferior freedom from aortic-related re-intervention (HR: 2.10, 95% CI: 1.45-3.04). Open repair demonstrated better all-cause survival beyond 16 months (HR: 1.64, 95% CI: 1.53-1.75). In patients with intact DTAA, open repair resulted in higher postoperative mortality (OR: 0.58, 95% CI: 0.38-0.88) but better all-cause survival beyond 7 months (HR: 1.72, 95% CI: 1.61-1.84). Adverse events were not specifically reported in the included studies.\n\nInterpretation: Endovascular repair offers advantages in short-term outcomes, including lower postoperative mortality and morbidity, and shorter lengths of intervention, ICU stay, and hospital stay. However, open repair provides better long-term all-cause survival and freedom from aortic-related re-intervention. These findings suggest that while endovascular repair is beneficial for immediate postoperative outcomes, open repair may be more advantageous for long-term survival. Trial registration: PROSPERO.
