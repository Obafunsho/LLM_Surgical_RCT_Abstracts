A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Aortic Clamping Strategies in Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting\n\nBackground: This study aimed to evaluate the impact of different aortic clamping strategies on cerebral embolic events during coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) in patients with low-grade aortic disease.\n\nMethods: A randomised controlled trial was conducted from 2012 to 2015, involving 142 patients with epiaortic ultrasound grade I/II aortic disease undergoing primary isolated CABG at a single center. Participants were randomised to either off-pump or on-pump CABG. Off-pump patients were further randomised to a partial clamp (n=36) or clampless facilitating device (CFD, n=36) strategy, while on-pump patients were randomised to a single (n=34) or double (n=36) clamp strategy. The primary outcome was the total number of high intensity transient signals (HITS) detected by transcranial Doppler ultrasonography during aortic manipulation. Randomisation was computer-generated, and allocation was concealed. Outcome assessors were blinded.\n\nResults: In the off-pump group, the median total HITS were significantly higher in the CFD group (30.0, IQR 22–43) compared to the partial clamp group (7.0, IQR 0–16) (p<0.0001). In the on-pump group, median total HITS were 10.0 (IQR 3–17) in the single-clamp group compared to 16.0 (IQR 4–49) in the double-clamp group (p=0.10). No significant differences in neurocognitive outcomes were observed.\n\nInterpretation: The use of CFDs in off-pump CABG increased cerebral embolic events compared to partial clamping. A single-clamp strategy in on-pump CABG did not significantly reduce embolic events compared to a double-clamp strategy. Trial registration: [Trial registration number].
