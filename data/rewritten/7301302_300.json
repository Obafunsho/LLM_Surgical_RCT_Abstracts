A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Ursodeoxycholic Acid for Gallstone Prevention Post-Gastrectomy\n\nBackground: Gallstone incidence increases after gastrectomy. This study evaluates the efficacy and safety of ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) in preventing gallstone formation in gastric cancer patients post-gastrectomy.\n\nMethods: This multicenter, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was conducted at 12 institutions in Korea. Adults (≥19 years) with gastric cancer undergoing gastrectomy were enrolled from May 26, 2015, to January 9, 2017. Participants were randomised 1:1:1 to receive 300 mg UDCA, 600 mg UDCA, or placebo daily for 52 weeks. Randomisation used a stratified block method, and allocation was concealed via an interactive web-response system. Blinding included participants, clinicians, and outcome assessors. The primary outcome was gallstone formation within 12 months, assessed by ultrasonography.\n\nResults: Of 521 randomised patients, 465 were analysed (151 in 300 mg group, 164 in 600 mg group, 150 in placebo group) using intention-to-treat. Gallstone formation occurred in 5.3% (8/151) of the 300 mg group, 4.3% (7/164) of the 600 mg group, and 16.7% (25/150) of the placebo group. Odds ratios were 0.27 (95% CI, 0.12-0.62; P = .002) for 300 mg and 0.20 (95% CI, 0.08-0.50; P < .001) for 600 mg. No significant adverse reactions were reported. The most common adverse event was nausea (0.8%), with no serious adverse reactions.\n\nInterpretation: UDCA significantly reduces gallstone incidence post-gastrectomy in gastric cancer patients. These findings suggest UDCA as a preventive measure against gallstone formation, offering a safer alternative to prophylactic cholecystectomy. Trial Registration: NCT02490111.
