A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Individualized Ventilation in Frail Patients Undergoing Non-Cardiac Surgery\n\nBackground: Frailty is associated with increased risk of postoperative pulmonary complications (PPCs) in surgical patients. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of driving pressure-guided individualized ventilation compared to standard positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) ventilation on PPCs in frail patients undergoing non-cardiac surgery.\n\nMethods: This prospective, randomized controlled trial was conducted at the First People’s Hospital of Xiangshan County from January to December 2024. Sixty-one frail patients aged ≥65 years scheduled for elective non-cardiac surgery were randomized to either the individualized PEEP group (n=31) or the standard PEEP group (n=30). The primary outcome was the incidence of PPCs within 7 days postoperatively. Randomization was based on a pre-established allocation list, and outcome assessors were blinded to group assignments. The individualized PEEP group received PEEP titrated to minimize driving pressure, while the standard PEEP group received a fixed PEEP of 5 cmH2O.\n\nResults: No PPCs occurred in the individualized PEEP group, whereas 7 patients (23.3%) in the standard PEEP group developed PPCs (p<0.01). The individualized PEEP group demonstrated significantly lower plateau pressure and airway pressure and improved dynamic lung compliance at T0 (p<0.001). No significant differences were found in arterial oxygen pressure or oxygenation index throughout the study period (p>0.05).\n\nInterpretation: Driving pressure-guided individualized ventilation significantly reduced PPCs and improved perioperative respiratory parameters in frail patients undergoing non-cardiac surgery. This strategy may help optimize intraoperative ventilation in high-risk surgical patients.\n\nTrial registration: Not provided.\n\nFunding: Not specified.",
