A 250-word version\n\nTitle: A Prospective Cohort Study on Walking Performance in Colorectal Cancer Surgery\n\nBackground: Colorectal cancer is a significant global health issue, with surgery being the primary curative treatment. This study investigates the impact of preoperative and postoperative walking performance in colorectal cancer patients undergoing surgery.\n\nMethods: This prospective cohort study was conducted at the Sestre Milosrdnice University Hospital Centre, Zagreb, Croatia, from March 2022 to September 2023. Eligible participants were colorectal cancer patients scheduled for elective open or laparoscopic abdominal surgery. Exclusion criteria included severe cardiorespiratory, musculoskeletal, or neurologic conditions. Participants completed the EORTC QLQ-C30 and QoR 15 questionnaires and performed a 6-minute walk test (6MWT) 2 days before and 7 days after surgery.\n\nResults: A total of 72 patients (mean age 62.48 years) were included in the final analysis. Significant differences were observed in walking performance pre- and post-surgery, with a higher average heart rate postoperatively (65 bpm pre-surgery vs. 99 bpm post-surgery, p = 0.008). Differences in walking distance were noted between genders (F = 4.99, p = 0.02), and age affected the number of steps (F = 2.90, p = 0.02). Body mass index influenced average (F = 5.72, p = 0.00) and maximum heart rate (F = 2.52, p = 0.04).\n\nInterpretation: The study highlights increased heart rates during the 6MWT post-surgery, particularly in overweight and obese patients. These findings suggest the need for tailored postoperative rehabilitation programs.",
