A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of MRI and Intraoperative Electrophysiological Recording in Targeting the Subthalamic Nucleus for Parkinson's Disease\n\nBackground: Accurate targeting of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) is crucial for effective deep brain stimulation in Parkinson's disease. This study evaluates the role of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and intraoperative electrophysiological recording in improving electrode placement accuracy.\n\nMethods: In this randomised controlled trial, 27 patients with Parkinson's disease were recruited from a single surgical center. Eligibility criteria included a diagnosis of Parkinson's disease and suitability for STN targeting. A total of 54 electrodes were implanted. Target planning was based on MRI visualisation and coordinate guidelines relative to the AC–PC line. Intraoperative microelectrode recording was used to adjust electrode positions. Postoperative MRI verified electrode placement accuracy in 16 cases.\n\nResults: The mean target based on MRI was 11.5 mm lateral, 2.5 mm posterior, and 4.1 mm inferior to the AC–PC line. Electrophysiological correction adjusted the mean target to 11.7 mm lateral, 2.1 mm posterior, and 3.8 mm inferior. The mean error in electrode placement was 0.48 mm, 0.69 mm, and 2.9 mm in the x, y, and z axes, respectively. No postoperative MRI-related complications were observed.\n\nInterpretation: Both MRI and intraoperative electrophysiological recording are essential for accurate STN targeting. Individual variations in STN location necessitate tailored approaches. The stereotactic method demonstrated high accuracy in electrode placement.\n\nTrial registration: Not provided.\n\nFunding: Not provided.",
