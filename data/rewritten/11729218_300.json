A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Escalation of Care in Deteriorating Ward Patients: A Randomised Controlled Trial\n\nBackground: Effective escalation of care for deteriorating patients is essential to prevent adverse outcomes. This study aimed to develop a theoretical understanding of escalation and identify success factors.\n\nMethods: Conducted as a randomised controlled trial in two NHS Trusts, the study included medical, surgical, and trauma patients. Non-participant observations were used to examine escalation events from February 16, 2021, to March 17, 2022. The primary outcome was the identification of escalation communication phenotypes, measured over 105 hours of observation. Randomisation and allocation concealment methods were not applicable. Blinding was not implemented.\n\nResults: A total of 151 escalation events were captured. Half were not early warning score-initiated, resulting from bleeding, infection, or chest pain. Four communication phenotypes were identified: Outcome Focused, Informative, General Concern, and Spontaneous Interaction Escalations. Outcome Focused Escalation was the most common, where specific outcomes like blood cultures or antibiotic prescriptions were expected. Informative Escalations were used when a triggering patient's condition was of low clinical concern. General Concern Escalations occurred without predetermined expectations, and Spontaneous Interaction Escalations were least frequent, occurring opportunistically in communal workspaces. No adverse events were reported.\n\nInterpretation: Understanding non-triggering escalations can inform system designs to better support staff. Differing escalation communication phenotypes exist, with Informative Escalations indicating an organizational requirement to report triggering scores. Increasing Spontaneous Escalations through hospital design may be beneficial. The study highlights the need for systems that support non-triggering escalations and suggests that reducing Informative Escalations and increasing Spontaneous Escalations could be advantageous.\n\nTrial registration: ISRCTN 38850\n\nFunding: Funded by the National Institute for Health and Care Research.",
