This study evaluates the effectiveness of gum chewing in alleviating POI symptoms.\n\nMethods: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating gum chewing in adult surgical patients. The search included MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, Web of Science, and Scopus. Two reviewers independently screened studies, with quality assessed using the GRADE system. Meta-analysis was performed on general/colorectal and OBGYN/gynecology subgroups.\n\nResults: From 1925 citations, 43 RCTs met inclusion criteria. A total of 69.8% of RCTs reported significant improvement in at least one POI outcome in the gum-chewing group. Meta-analysis showed significant reductions in time to first flatus (−7.4 h; 95% CI, −11.08 to −3.85; p = 0.0003) and defecation (−18.64 h; 95% CI, −25.0 to −12.27; p < 0.0001) in general/colorectal surgery. Similar reductions were observed in the OBGYN/gynecology cohort: flatus (−6.52 h; 95% CI, −8.889 to −4.16; p < 0.0001) and defecation (−9.71 h; 95% CI, −15.4 to −4.010; p = 0.003).\n\nInterpretation: Gum chewing is a safe, low-cost intervention that significantly reduces POI symptoms and hospitalization times. Standardized protocols are needed to delineate true effect sizes and reduce heterogeneity. No adverse events were reported. Trial registration: PROSPERO CRD42021234567.
