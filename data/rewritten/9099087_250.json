A 250-word version\n\nTitle: A Randomised Controlled Trial Comparing Modified Ligation Procedure and Stapled Haemorrhoidectomy for Symptomatic Haemorrhoids\n\nBackground: This study aimed to compare the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of a modified ligation procedure for prolapsed haemorrhoids (MLPPH) versus stapled haemorrhoidectomy (SH) in patients with symptomatic haemorrhoids.\n\nMethods: This single-centre, randomised, single-blind trial was conducted at Putuo Hospital, Shanghai, from May 2018 to September 2021. Patients aged 18–80 years with symptomatic second- to fourth-degree haemorrhoids were randomised 1:1 to MLPPH or SH. The primary outcome was the 6-month cure rate. Randomisation was stratified by haemorrhoid grade using a computer-generated sequence with allocation concealment via opaque envelopes. Blinding was not applied to participants or clinicians.\n\nResults: A total of 133 patients were randomised (67 to MLPPH, 66 to SH). The 6-month cure rate was higher in the MLPPH group (90.6%) compared to the SH group (69.7%) (P = 0.003). The mean operating time was longer for MLPPH (57.42 min) than SH (30.68 min) (P < 0.001). MLPPH resulted in lower pain scores at postoperative days 3, 7, and 14, and lower Wexner incontinence scores at months 1 and 3. Cost-effectiveness analysis showed lower mean costs for MLPPH (EUR 1080.24) compared to SH (EUR 1657.97) (P < 0.001).\n\nInterpretation: MLPPH is a longer but more cost-effective procedure than SH, providing better short-term outcomes in terms of pain and incontinence scores.
