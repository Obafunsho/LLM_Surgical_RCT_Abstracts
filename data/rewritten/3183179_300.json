A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Anterolateral Versus Midline Skin Incision in Total Knee Arthroplasty: A Randomised Controlled Trial\n\nBackground: The anterior midline skin incision in total knee arthroplasty (TKA) provides excellent surgical exposure but often involves sectioning the infrapatellar branch of the saphenous nerve, leading to potential lateral cutaneous hypesthesia and neuroma formation. This study investigates whether an anterolateral skin incision reduces the area of skin hypesthesia and associated postoperative discomfort.\n\nMethods: This randomised controlled trial included 69 knees undergoing TKA, assigned to either a midline or an anterolateral skin incision. Participants were eligible if they required TKA and were recruited from a single orthopedic center. The primary outcome was the area of skin hypesthesia, assessed using Semmes-Weinstein monofilament at 13 reference points at 6 weeks, 6 months, and 12 months postoperatively. Randomisation was conducted using a computer-generated sequence, with allocation concealment ensured. Outcome assessors were blinded to group assignments.\n\nResults: The anterolateral incision group demonstrated significantly smaller areas of hypesthesia compared to the midline group at all time points: 32 cm² vs. 76 cm² at 6 weeks, 14 cm² vs. 29 cm² at 6 months, and 7 cm² vs. 19 cm² at 1 year. Clinical scores and knee ROM were comparable between groups. A correlation was found between smaller hypesthesia areas and improved WOMAC and KOOS scores and greater knee flexion. No adverse events were reported in either group.\n\nInterpretation: The anterolateral incision is associated with fewer sensory disturbances and appears to be a reasonable alternative to the midline incision in TKA. Trial registration: [Trial registration number]. Funding: [Source of funding]. This study provides Level I evidence supporting the use of anterolateral incisions in TKA to minimize sensory complications.",
