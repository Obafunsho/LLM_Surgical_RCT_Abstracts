This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of mesh reinforcement in reducing clinically significant pancreatic leaks.\n\nMethods: This single-blinded, parallel-group, randomised controlled trial was conducted at a large tertiary hospital. Eligible patients undergoing left pancreatectomy were randomised intraoperatively to either mesh reinforcement (Seamguard® or Peristrips Dry®) or no mesh reinforcement. The primary outcome was the incidence of clinically significant pancreatic leaks, defined by the ISGPF grading system, assessed over a 6-week period. Randomisation was performed using a computer-generated sequence with allocation concealment. Patients were blinded to group allocation.\n\nResults: A total of 100 patients were randomised: 54 to the mesh group and 46 to the control group. One death occurred in each group. ISGPF grade B and C leaks were observed in 1.9% (1/53) of the mesh group and 20% (11/45) of the control group (p=0.0007). The analysis was conducted on an intention-to-treat basis.\n\nInterpretation: Mesh reinforcement significantly reduces the incidence of clinically significant pancreatic fistula in patients undergoing left pancreatectomy. The trial is registered at Clinicaltrials.gov (NCT01359410).\n\nFunding: Not specified.",
