This study assessed its impact on textbook outcomes, addressing concerns about long-term side effects, operating times, and cost-effectiveness.\n\nMethods: A stepped-wedge cluster randomised trial was conducted in 12 Dutch hospitals. Eligible participants were patients undergoing mastectomy without reconstruction. The intervention was the quilt technique, compared to conventional closure. The primary outcome was textbook outcome, defined as the absence of wound complications, readmissions, reoperations, unscheduled outpatient visits, and no increase in pain medication use 6 months post-surgery. Randomisation was by cluster, with allocation concealment ensured. Blinding was not feasible for patients or clinicians.\n\nResults: A total of 251 patients were included, with 179 in the quilted cohort and 72 in the non-quilted cohort. The quilted cohort had a higher incidence of textbook outcome (65.7% vs. 41.3%, odds ratio: 2.95, 95% CI: 1.45, 6.24, P = 0.003). Clinically significant seroma was less frequent in the quilted group (24.0% vs. 55.6%, P < 0.001). Unscheduled outpatient visits were also reduced in the quilted cohort (30.2% vs. 44.4%, P = 0.048). No significant differences were observed in postoperative pain, shoulder function, satisfaction, or cosmetic outcomes. No adverse events were reported.\n\nInterpretation: Quilting after mastectomy improved textbook outcomes and reduced healthcare consumption without undesirable side effects. The technique is cost-effective, saving €570 per patient, and can be implemented with a short learning curve.\n\nTrial Registration: NCT05272904, ClinicalTrials.gov.\n\nFunding: Not specified.",
