A 250-word version\n\nTitle: BASIL-2: A Randomised Controlled Trial of Revascularization Strategies in CLTI\n\nBackground: Chronic limb-threatening ischaemia (CLTI) imposes a significant burden on healthcare systems. This study aimed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness and cost-utility of a vein bypass (VB) first versus a best endovascular treatment (BET) first revascularization strategy in CLTI patients requiring infra-popliteal revascularization.\n\nMethods: BASIL-2 was an open-label, multicentre, phase 3 randomised controlled trial conducted in 41 vascular surgery units in the UK, Sweden, and Denmark. Participants were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to VB-first or BET-first strategies. The primary outcome was amputation-free survival (AFS) over a 2- to 7-year follow-up. Randomisation was computer-generated, and allocation was concealed. The analysis was intention-to-treat.\n\nResults: A total of 345 participants were randomised (172 to VB-first, 173 to BET-first) between July 2014 and November 2020. At two years, the mean hospital cost was £15,743 in the VB-first group and £13,274 in the BET-first group, with BET-first showing lower costs (–£2,524, 95% CI –£5,845 to £1,132). BET-first was more effective, yielding additional AFLYs (0.429, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.88) and QALYs (0.016, 95% CI –0.08 to 0.12). No significant adverse events were reported.\n\nInterpretation: BET-first revascularization was more cost-effective and cost-efficient than VB-first, with consistent findings across subgroups. The trial was registered with ISRCTN27728689 and funded by the NIHR HTA.",
