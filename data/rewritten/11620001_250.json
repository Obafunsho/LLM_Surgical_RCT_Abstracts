This study evaluates the efficacy of external stenting in preventing SVG failure.\n\nMethods: This randomised controlled trial was conducted at multiple centers. Participants were patients undergoing CABG with at least two planned SVGs. Eligibility criteria included adults with multivessel coronary artery disease. Participants were randomised to receive either external stenting or standard care. Randomisation was computer-generated, and allocation was concealed using sealed envelopes. Blinding was applied to outcome assessors.\n\nObjective: To assess the effect of external stenting on SVG failure rates.\n\nOutcome: The primary outcome was SVG failure at 12 months, defined as >50% stenosis on angiography.\n\nResults: A total of 200 participants were randomised: 100 to the intervention group and 100 to the control group. Analysis was conducted on 98 participants in the intervention group and 97 in the control group using an intention-to-treat approach. The intervention group showed a significant reduction in SVG failure (mean difference = 10%, 95% CI 5% to 15%; p = 0.01). Adverse events were reported in 3% of the intervention group and 1% of the control group, with mild severity.\n\nTrial registration: NCT12345678.\n\nFunding: Supported by the National Institutes of Health.",
