This study investigates the potential of L-Ornithine-L-Aspartate (LOLA) to enhance angiogenesis and perfusion in a rat model of hind limb ischemia (HLI).\n\nMethods: The study was conducted on male Sprague Dawley rats (n=21), randomly assigned to three groups: control (normal saline), sorbitol, and LOLA. HLI was induced by unilateral femoral artery ligation. Intraperitoneal injections were administered on post-operative days (PODs) 3, 5, 7, 10, and 12. Perfusion imaging was performed on PODs 7 and 14, followed by immunohistochemistry and Western blotting. Randomisation was stratified by body weight, and outcome assessors were blinded to group allocation.\n\nResults: The LOLA group demonstrated a significant increase in perfusion recovery (mean difference = 13.77, 95% CI 1.23 to 26.31; p < 0.05) compared to control and sorbitol groups. CD31-positive capillary density was significantly higher in the LOLA group, indicating enhanced angiogenesis. VEGF expression was also significantly elevated in the LOLA group, supporting the angiogenic effect of LOLA.\n\nInterpretation: The administration of LOLA in a rat HLI model significantly improves angiogenesis and perfusion recovery. Given its established safety and commercial availability, LOLA presents a promising therapeutic option for PAD, with potential for rapid clinical translation.\n\nTrial registration: Not applicable.\n\nFunding: Not specified.",
