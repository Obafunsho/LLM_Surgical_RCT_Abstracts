Participants were randomly assigned to receive either the CAPAC treatment (SQ3370) or conventional doxorubicin. The intervention involved a tetrazine-modified biopolymer (SQL70) injected at the tumor site, followed by systemic administration of a TCO-modified protodrug (SQP33). The primary outcome was the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of SQP33, measured over a 38-day period. Randomisation was achieved using a computer-generated sequence, with allocation concealment ensured by sealed envelopes. Blinding was applied to outcome assessors.\n\nResults: A total of 40 mice were randomised, with 20 in each group. The MTD of SQP33 was 19.1-times higher than conventional doxorubicin in mice. Pharmacokinetics in rats showed SQL70 captured multiple SQP33 doses at 10.8-times the MTD of doxorubicin, with reduced systemic toxicity. Adverse events were less frequent in the CAPAC group, with no severe events reported. The CAPAC treatment demonstrated significant antitumor activity, prolonging median overall survival to 47 days compared to 31 days for the control group.\n\nInterpretation: The CAPAC platform significantly increased the MTD of doxorubicin with reduced toxicity, demonstrating potential for improved cancer treatment. The findings support further clinical development of the CAPAC platform. Trial registration: NCT04106492. Funding: Shasqi, Inc.",
