The primary outcome was incision length, measured immediately post-surgery. Randomisation and allocation concealment methods were not specified. Blinding details were not provided. Data were analyzed using Stata 15.1 and the Gemtc 1.0.1 package in R 4.2.3. The study included 1525 patients: 504 in the RNSM group, 771 in the CNSM group, and 250 in the ENSM group.\n\nResults: ENSM with IPBR resulted in a significantly smaller incision (WMD: -5.57 cm, 95% CI: -10.74 to -0.69) compared to CNSM. RNSM with IPBR showed a lower incidence of total complications (WMD: 0.73, 95% CI: 0.61–0.88), grade 3 complications (WMD: 0.37, 95% CI: 0.20–0.62), and recurrence (WMD: 0.060, 95% CI: 0.0018–0.47) than CNSM. CNSM with IPBR had better outcomes in surgical time and hospital stay. Adverse events were not detailed.\n\nInterpretation: RNSM and ENSM with IPBR offer superior outcomes in incision length, complication rates, and recurrence compared to CNSM. These findings suggest that RNSM and ENSM are more effective and safer than conventional approaches. Further high-quality trials are needed to confirm these results and address the limitations of current studies.\n\nTrial registration: osf.io/5j3dk\n\nFunding: Not specified.",
