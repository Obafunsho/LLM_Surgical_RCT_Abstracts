A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Negative Pressure Wound Therapy vs. Conventional Wound Therapy for Surgical Abdominal Wound Healing Impairment\n\nBackground: Negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) is widely used for complex wounds, but evidence on its resource use is limited.\n\nMethods: This multicenter, multinational, randomised controlled trial enrolled 539 adult patients with surgical abdominal wound healing impairment (SAWHI) without fascial dehiscence across 34 sites in Germany, Belgium, and the Netherlands from August 2, 2011, to January 31, 2018. Participants were randomly assigned to NPWT or conventional wound therapy (CWT) using a computer-generated list with allocation concealment. The primary outcome was resource use, including inpatient and outpatient time, personnel, and material for wound treatment over 42 days. The analysis was primarily per-protocol (NPWT 157; CWT 174).\n\nResults: Treatment length was significantly shorter with NPWT [Mean (SD) NPWT 22.8 (13.4) days; CWT 30.6 (13.3) days; P < 0.001]. Hospitalization time was shorter with CWT [Mean (SD) NPWT 13.9 (11.1) days; CWT 11.8 (10.8) days; P = 0.047]. More participants were outpatient with CWT [96.0%] than NPWT [89.2%; P = 0.017]. Time for dressing changes per participant was significantly lower with NPWT [Mean (SD) NPWT 196 (221.1) min; CWT 278 (208.2) min; P < 0.001]. Time for wound-related procedures was also lower with NPWT [Mean (SD) NPWT 167 (195) min; CWT 266 (313) min; P < 0.001].\n\nInterpretation: NPWT reduces resource use and may be an efficient alternative to CWT for SAWHI. No adverse events were reported. \n\nTrial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01528033.\n\nFunding: Not specified.",
