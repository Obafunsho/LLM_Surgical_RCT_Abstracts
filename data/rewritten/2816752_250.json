This study aimed to compare tibial bone density changes in cemented TKA components with different bearing designs.\n\nMethods: We conducted a randomised controlled trial with 54 participants, randomised to receive either rotating-platform (n=28) or fixed-platform (n=26) cemented TKA. The study was conducted at [study setting]. Eligibility criteria included [participant eligibility criteria]. Bone density changes were assessed using quantitative computed tomography (qCT)-assisted osteodensitometry. The nonoperated contralateral side served as a control. CT scans were performed postoperatively and at 1 and 2 years. Randomisation was achieved using [randomisation method] with allocation concealment via [allocation concealment method]. Blinding was applied to [outcome assessors/patients/clinicians].\n\nResults: Cancellous bone density loss was observed in all proximal tibial regions in both cohorts, with a maximum loss of 12.6% at 2 years. Cortical bone density loss was lower, with a maximum of 3.6% at 2 years. No significant differences in bone loss were found between the fixed- and rotating-platform implants. The analysis was conducted using [analysis approach]. No adverse events were reported.\n\nInterpretation: The decrease in cancellous bone density after TKA suggests stress transfer to the cortical bone. Further research is needed to understand the clinical implications of these findings.\n\nTrial registration: [Trial registration number]\n\nFunding: [Source of funding]",
