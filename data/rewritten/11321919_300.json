A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Methadone for Opioid-Sparing in Pediatric Tonsillectomy\n\nBackground: Effective pain management post-tonsillectomy in children remains unresolved, with methadone offering potential benefits due to its longer duration of action compared to short-duration opioids like fentanyl.\n\nMethods: This double-blind, randomised controlled trial was conducted in a pediatric surgical setting. Eligible participants were children aged 3-17 years undergoing tonsillectomy. They were randomised to receive either a single intravenous dose of methadone (0.1 mg/kg or 0.15 mg/kg) or as-needed fentanyl. The primary outcome was total opioid use over 7 days, measured in oral morphine equivalents per kilogram (OME/kg). Secondary outcomes included opioid use in the PACU, daily pain scores, and total number of opioid doses over 7 days. Randomisation was computer-generated, with allocation concealed using sealed envelopes. Blinding included patients, clinicians, and outcome assessors.\n\nResults: Sixty children were randomised (20 per group) and analysed per protocol. Total 7-day opioid use was significantly lower in the methadone groups: 0.9 [0.1,1.4] OME/kg for 0.1 mg/kg (P=0.045) and 0.5 [0,1.4] OME/kg for 0.15 mg/kg (P=0.023), compared to 1.5 [1.2,2.1] OME/kg in controls. PACU opioid use was also reduced in the methadone groups: 0.04 [0,0.1] OME/kg for 0.1 mg/kg and 0.0 [0,0.1] OME/kg for 0.15 mg/kg, compared to 0.15 [0.1,0.3] OME/kg in controls. No significant differences in pain scores were observed. No serious opioid-related adverse events occurred.\n\nInterpretation: Single-dose intraoperative methadone at 0.15 mg/kg is effective in reducing postoperative opioid use in children undergoing tonsillectomy without increasing adverse events.\n\nTrial registration: [Trial registration number]\n\nFunding: [Source of funding]",
