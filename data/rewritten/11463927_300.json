Participants were randomised to receive a caudal block with dexmedetomidine 1 μg/kg (Group D), morphine 30 μg/kg (Group M), or clonidine 1.5 μg/kg (Group C), along with 0.2% ropivacaine. Randomisation was computer-generated with allocation concealment using sealed envelopes. Blinding included patients, clinicians, and outcome assessors. The primary outcome was the duration of analgesia, defined as the time until the first rescue analgesic was required. Secondary outcomes included total analgesic requirements and incidence of complications within 24 hours post-surgery.\n\nResults: The median duration of analgesia was 380 minutes for Group D, 360 minutes for Group C, and 405 minutes for Group M, with no statistically significant difference (P = 0.843). Total perioperative opioid use and side effects were similar across groups. Intraoperative hypotension occurred in 43.5% of Group D, 27.8% of Group C, and 22.7% of Group M (P = 0.299). Postoperative nausea and vomiting were observed in 21.7% of Group D, 5.6% of Group C, and 18.2% of Group M (P = 0.382). One patient in Group M required supplemental oxygen due to sedation.\n\nInterpretation: Morphine, dexmedetomidine, and clonidine provide comparable analgesic duration and side-effect profiles in pediatric infraumbilical surgeries.
