This study aimed to evaluate the effects of RIC on outcomes following orthopaedic surgery.\n\nMethods: A systematic review of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) was conducted, including both pre-clinical and clinical studies. MEDLINE and EMBASE databases were searched from 1966 to March 2024. Eligibility criteria included RCTs investigating RIC in fracture healing and orthopaedic surgery. The primary outcome was the effect of RIC on oxidative stress, measured immediately post-surgery. Randomisation methods varied, and blinding was implemented in most clinical studies.\n\nResults: Three pre-clinical RCTs involving 198 rats demonstrated enhanced callus formation and reduced oxidative stress with RIC. Sixteen clinical RCTs with 628 patients undergoing elective orthopaedic procedures showed significant reductions in oxidative stress and pain scores, and improved oxygenation. RIC protocols varied in cycle frequency, duration, and pressure, but all were administered as a single dose at anaesthesia induction. One study of 648 patients with acute hip fracture reported early cardioprotective effects. No severe adverse events were reported.\n\nInterpretation: Preliminary evidence supports the potential benefits of RIC in orthopaedic surgery, including reduced oxidative stress and improved clinical outcomes. However, trials to date are largely small, and further large-scale RCTs are needed to determine optimal RIC parameters and identify patient populations that may benefit most. The study highlights the need for well-powered multicentre RCTs to address unanswered questions about RIC's therapeutic potential in orthopaedic surgery.\n\nTrial registration: Not specified.\n\nFunding: Not specified.",
