A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of High-Dose Magnesium Sulfate Infusion for Opioid-Sparing Analgesia in Pediatric Transplant Recipients\n\nBackground: The opioid crisis highlights the need for opioid-sparing analgesics. This trial evaluated the feasibility of high-dose magnesium sulfate (MgSO4) infusion for analgesia in pediatric transplant recipients.\n\nMethods: Conducted at the University of Minnesota, this prospective trial with a retrospective control group included participants aged 3–18 years undergoing total pancreatectomy with islet cell autotransplantation or liver transplantation. Exclusion criteria were pregnancy, neuromuscular disease, hypersensitivity, preoperative creatinine >1.5 times upper limit normal, arrhythmia, or pacemaker presence. Eleven patients were enrolled from July 2020 to December 2022. The intervention involved a MgSO4 bolus (50 mg/kg) followed by an infusion (15 mg/kg/h) for up to 48 hours. The primary outcome was oral morphine equivalent (OME) per kg per day during the PICU stay. Secondary outcomes focused on safety, including hemodynamic and electrolyte variables. Randomisation and blinding details were not applicable.\n\nResults: The treatment group showed a trend towards higher intravenous fluid requirement (~1 bolus) but no increase in blood product use. No serious adverse events were reported. The study was not powered to detect efficacy, and the small sample size limited statistical analysis.\n\nInterpretation: High-dose MgSO4 infusion is feasible for opioid-sparing analgesia in pediatric transplant recipients, with no serious adverse events. Further studies with larger sample sizes are needed to assess efficacy and optimize dosing.\n\nTrial registration: NCT04812028\n\nFunding: University of Minnesota Department of Pediatrics.",
