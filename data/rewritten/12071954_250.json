A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial on the Impact of a Reference Guide for Bariatric Surgery Nursing Care\n\nBackground: Bariatric surgery is essential for treating morbid obesity, requiring nursing staff to have comprehensive knowledge to ensure effective patient care. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of a reference guide on nurses' knowledge and patient satisfaction.\n\nMethods: A quasi-experimental design was used at Mansoura University Hospital, involving 78 nurses and 156 patients. Participants were divided into two groups: 78 patients before and 78 after the guide's implementation. The primary outcome was the improvement in nurses' knowledge and patient satisfaction, measured over a 9-month period. Randomisation and allocation concealment methods were not applicable. Blinding was not implemented.\n\nResults: Post-intervention, nurses with good knowledge increased from 10.3% to 80.8%, and poor self-reported practices decreased from 80.8% to 5.1%. Patient satisfaction significantly improved. No adverse events were reported.\n\nInterpretation: The reference guide significantly enhanced nurses' knowledge and patient satisfaction. Continuous educational programs are recommended to maintain these improvements.\n\nTrial registration: Not provided.\n\nFunding: Not specified.",
