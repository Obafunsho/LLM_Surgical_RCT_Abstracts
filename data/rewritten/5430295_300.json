A 300-word version\n\nTitle: The REDWASH Trial: A Randomised Controlled Trial of Red Blood Cell Washing in Cardiac Surgery\n\nBackground: This randomised controlled trial assessed whether washing allogeneic red blood cells (RBCs) could reduce inflammation and organ injury in cardiac surgery patients at high risk of large-volume transfusion.\n\nMethods: Conducted at three UK cardiac centres, 60 adult patients were randomised 1:1 to receive either washed RBCs or standard care RBCs. The primary outcome was serum interleukin-8 (IL-8) measured at baseline and four postsurgery time points. Randomisation was stratified by study site and procedure type, with allocation concealed via an Internet-based system. Outcome assessors were blinded.\n\nResults: Between May 2013 and March 2015, 29 patients were allocated to standard care and 27 to the washing group. Analysis was intention-to-treat. There was no significant difference in IL-8 levels between groups [adjusted mean difference 0.239 (95% CI -0.231, 0.709), P=0.318]. Mechanical washing reduced RBC-derived microvesicles but increased cell-free haemoglobin. No differences were observed in plasma microvesicles, platelet and leucocyte activation, or biomarkers of organ injury. Adverse events were not significantly different between groups.\n\nInterpretation: RBC washing did not demonstrate clinical benefits in reducing inflammation or organ injury in this high-risk cardiac surgery population. The trial was registered under ISRCTN 27076315 and funded by [source not specified]. The study's early termination due to slow recruitment limits the power of these findings, and further research is needed to explore potential benefits or risks of RBC washing in different settings.",
