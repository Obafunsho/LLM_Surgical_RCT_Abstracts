This study evaluates the efficacy of the cuff inflation-deflation technique compared to the conventional method for NTI.\n\nMethods: This prospective, randomised controlled trial was conducted in a surgical setting. Participants were 106 patients aged 18-65 years, ASA I-II, scheduled for elective surgeries requiring NTI. Exclusion criteria included difficult airway, nasal trauma, and refusal to participate. Patients were randomly allocated to either the conventional group (Group C) or the cuff inflation group (Group I) using block randomisation with a 1:1 ratio. The primary outcome was intubation time, measured from oropharynx entry to successful end-tidal CO2 confirmation. Secondary outcomes included the number of maneuvers, hemodynamic responses, and complications. Randomisation was concealed using opaque envelopes. Blinding was not possible for the anesthesiologists.\n\nResults: 53 patients were randomised to each group. Intubation time was significantly shorter in Group I (27.86 ± 4.47 s) compared to Group C (41.11 ± 10.98 s; P < 0.0001). Group I required fewer maneuvers (13/53) than Group C (28/53; P = 0.00277). Hemodynamic parameters were more stable in Group I, with lower heart rate and blood pressure at 3-5 minutes post-induction. Mild to moderate nasal bleeding occurred in 5/53 patients in Group I and 8/53 in Group C. No severe complications were reported.\n\nInterpretation: The cuff inflation-deflation technique significantly reduces intubation time, hemodynamic stress, and maneuver requirements compared to the conventional method, offering a safer and more efficient approach to NTI.
