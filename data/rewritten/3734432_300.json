The primary outcome was the incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) over 72 hours. Randomisation was achieved using a computer-generated sequence with allocation concealment. Blinding was maintained for outcome assessors, patients, and clinicians. The study was conducted at a single tertiary care center. Eligibility criteria included [eligibility criteria].\n\nResults: The Dexa-Ra group experienced a significantly lower incidence of PONV over 72 hours (p < 0.05) and less severe nausea in the first 6 hours postoperatively. Rescue antiemetic use was less frequent, and complete response was more frequent in the Dexa-Ra group. Pain levels and opioid consumption were reduced in the Dexa-Ra group during the 6- to 24-hour period and overall. No significant differences in wound complications or periprosthetic joint infections were observed between groups. Adverse events were similar between groups, with one periprosthetic joint infection in each group.\n\nInterpretation: The addition of dexamethasone to ramosetron effectively reduces postoperative emesis and pain without increasing wound complications in TKA patients.
