Bibliometric analysis was performed using the biblioshiny package in R, VOSviewer, and CiteSpace.\n\nResults: A total of 293 eligible publications were identified. Publication volume increased significantly in 2001 and 2014. Keyword co-occurrence analysis revealed four primary clusters: cardiopulmonary bypass, systemic inflammatory response, methylprednisolone, and dysfunction. Over recent decades, research focus has shifted from examining how prophylactic corticosteroid use attenuates postoperative inflammation to investigating its potential effects on clinical complications following cardiac surgery.\n\nInterpretation: Considerable heterogeneity in inflammatory response phenotypes among individuals may lead to significant differences in the clinical effectiveness of prophylactic corticosteroid interventions. Developing personalized treatment strategies should become a major focus in future research. The study highlights the need for further investigation into the optimal dosage and timing of corticosteroid administration, as well as the identification of patient subgroups that may benefit most from this intervention. Additionally, the analysis underscores the importance of considering both adult and pediatric populations separately due to their distinct physiological and pathological differences. Future research should focus on developing predictive models for high-risk patient identification and evaluating corticosteroid effectiveness and safety in these groups.",
