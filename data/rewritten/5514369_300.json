A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of 17 β-Estradiol in Postmenopausal Women Undergoing Cardiac Surgery\n\nBackground: This randomised controlled trial aimed to assess the effect of perioperative 17 β-estradiol on neurocognitive dysfunction and quality of life in postmenopausal women undergoing cardiac surgery.\n\nMethods: A total of 174 postmenopausal women were randomly assigned to receive either 17 β-estradiol or placebo in a double-blind manner, starting the day before surgery and continuing until the fifth postoperative day. Participants were recruited from a single cardiac surgery center. The primary outcome was neurocognitive dysfunction, assessed using a standard psychometric battery at baseline, 4 to 6 weeks, and 6 months postoperatively. Quality of life was measured using the SF-36 and Lawton scales at baseline and 6 months. Randomisation was computer-generated, and allocation was concealed. Blinding included patients, clinicians, and outcome assessors.\n\nResults: Of the 174 participants, 108 completed the study (54 in each group). Thirteen percent exhibited neurocognitive dysfunction postoperatively. Neurocognitive deficits were independently associated with lower SF-36 physical scores (P = 0.004) and Lawton scores (P = 0.026) at 6 months. Treatment with 17 β-estradiol (P = 0.003) and smoking status (P = 0.015) were predictors of worse SF-36 mental scores. Preoperative lower scores were independently associated with low quality of life postoperatively for all measurements. No significant adverse events were reported in either group.\n\nInterpretation: Postoperative neurocognitive dysfunction adversely affects quality of life in postmenopausal women after cardiac surgery. Perioperative 17 β-estradiol does not improve postoperative quality of life. The relationship between preoperative and postoperative health status suggests that some aspects of quality of life are not amenable to improvement with cardiac surgery.\n\nTrial registration: [Trial registration number]\n\nFunding: [Source of funding]",
