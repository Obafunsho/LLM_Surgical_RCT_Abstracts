  "abstract": "1. A 250-word version\n\nBACKGROUND: This study is a case report of a 58-year-old male patient who underwent a Bentall procedure for an ascending aortic aneurysm and experienced multiple episodes of ventricular fibrillation (VF) after weaning from cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). METHODS: The patient was treated at a cardiac surgery center. The intervention involved coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) of the proximal right coronary artery and the left anterior descending artery. The primary outcome was the resolution of VF episodes, measured immediately post-intervention. RESULTS: The patient experienced recurrent VF episodes attributed to coronary insufficiency following aortic root reconstruction. CABG successfully resolved the VF, allowing the patient to be weaned from CPB and transferred to the intensive care unit. The patient was discharged after supportive treatment. INTERPRETATION: Coronary insufficiency should be considered a potential cause of VF in aortic root replacement surgeries. CABG is an effective treatment for VF caused by coronary insufficiency. The study highlights the importance of timely identification and management of coronary insufficiency to prevent refractory VF. No adverse events were reported. The study was not a randomized controlled trial, and no trial registration or funding information is applicable.",
