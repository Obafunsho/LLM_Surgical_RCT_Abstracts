Participants were randomised to either TAI or SOC. The primary outcome was the change in LARS score at 3 months. Randomisation was achieved through a computer-generated sequence without allocation concealment. Blinding was not implemented.\n\nResults: Sixty-four patients were screened, and 32 were randomised (16 to TAI, 16 to SOC) between January 2020 and June 2021. One patient from each group was excluded, resulting in 15 analysed per group. The mean LARS score decreased significantly more in the TAI group compared to SOC (p = 0.008). A sensitivity analysis confirmed these findings. Seventeen adverse events were reported in 14 patients, with none severe. In the TAI group, five patients experienced irrigation-related pain or spasms. The time spent on bowel management decreased significantly in the TAI group. All patients using the Peristeen® cone catheter opted to continue treatment post-study.\n\nInterpretation: TAI with a cone catheter demonstrated significant improvement in LARS scores compared to SOC, with a manageable safety profile. These findings suggest TAI as a viable treatment option, though further research is needed to assess long-term outcomes.\n\nTrial registration: NCT12345678\n\nFunding: The trial was funded by Coloplast, Humlebaek, Denmark.",
