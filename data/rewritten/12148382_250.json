A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Electrocoagulation vs. Radiofrequency Ablation for Great Saphenous Vein: A Randomised Controlled Trial\n\nBackground: Thermoablation is increasingly used for treating primary varicose veins. This study compares the long-term outcomes of electrocoagulation ablation (EA) and radiofrequency ablation (RFA) of the great saphenous vein (GSV).\n\nMethods: In this double-blind, randomised controlled trial, 57 adults with primary chronic venous insufficiency were recruited from the Dante Pazzanese Institute of Cardiology and the Adventist Hospital of São Paulo. Participants were randomly assigned to EA or RFA groups using sealed envelopes. The primary outcome was GSV occlusion, assessed via duplex ultrasound at 1 week, 3 months, 6 months, and annually. Secondary outcomes included complication rates and quality of life improvements, measured by the Aberdeen Varicose Vein Questionnaire. Blinding was maintained for patients and outcome assessors.\n\nResults: Between November 2014 and May 2016, 57 patients were randomised: 28 to EA and 29 to RFA. At 4.8 years, occlusion rates were 89.7% for EA and 66.7% for RFA (P = .001). No significant differences were found in complication rates or quality of life scores. Adverse events were similar between groups.\n\nInterpretation: EA demonstrated higher long-term GSV occlusion rates compared to RFA, with comparable safety and quality of life outcomes.
