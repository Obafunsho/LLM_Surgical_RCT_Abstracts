  "abstract": "2. A 300-word version\n\nBackground: The objective of this study was to revise the 2019 EACTS/EACTA/EBCP guidelines on cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) in adult cardiac surgery, integrating new evidence and expanding the scope to include temperature management and deep hypothermic circulatory arrest. Methods: A multidisciplinary task force conducted a systematic literature review from May to September 2023, focusing on randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and other relevant studies. The task force critically appraised the evidence and developed recommendations through consensus, requiring an 80% response rate and at least 75% affirmative votes for consensus. Results: The updated guidelines feature new sections on tubing materials, neuromonitoring, organ protection, blood purification, and perfusion strategies for aortic operations. The guidelines emphasize the need for further research in CPB domains and provide evidence-based recommendations where possible. The task force ensured transparency and integrity by declaring conflicts of interest, and the guidelines were reviewed and endorsed by the governing bodies of EACTS, EACTAIC, and EBCP. Interpretation: These guidelines aim to standardize and optimize CPB techniques and perioperative management, enhancing safety and efficacy in cardiac surgery. They are intended to inform clinical practice, not replace clinical judgment, and should be adapted to each patient's unique needs. The guidelines are not legally binding, and adherence does not modify healthcare professionals' legal responsibilities. Funding: The task force was funded exclusively by EACTS, EACTAIC, and EBCP, without involvement from the healthcare industry. Trial registration: Not applicable.",
