This study investigates the impact of an iteratively adapted MBI, ESRT, on perceived stress, executive cognitive function, psychosocial well-being, and pro-inflammatory gene expression in surgical and mixed specialty PGY-1 trainees.\n\nMethods: Two small single-institution randomised clinical trials were conducted. Participants included first-year surgical (ESRT-1, n = 44) and mixed specialty (ESRT-2, n = 45) residents. ESRT-1 consisted of 8 weekly 2-hour classes, while ESRT-2 comprised 6 weekly 90-minute classes. The primary outcome was perceived stress, measured pre- and post-intervention and at follow-up. Secondary outcomes included executive function, burnout, mindfulness, and pro-inflammatory gene expression. Randomisation was achieved using a computer-generated sequence, with allocation concealment. Outcome assessors were blinded to group assignments.\n\nResults: ESRT did not significantly impact perceived stress. However, ESRT-1 participants exhibited higher executive function and mindfulness scores, while ESRT-2 participants showed reduced emotional exhaustion and depersonalization scores at follow-up. Pooled analysis revealed that ESRT-treated participants had lower pro-inflammatory RNA expression compared to controls. No adverse events were reported in either group.\n\nInterpretation: This pilot study suggests that ESRT can variably enhance executive function, reduce burnout, and decrease physiological distress in PGY-1 trainees. The potential for further tailoring to optimize these effects warrants additional investigation.\n\nTrial registration: [Trial registration number]\n\nFunding: [Source of funding]",
