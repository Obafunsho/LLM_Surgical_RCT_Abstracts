A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial Comparing Sclerotherapy and Intralesional Excision for Aneurysmal Bone Cysts\n\nBackground: This study aims to compare the healing rates and safety of percutaneous repetitive sclerotherapy using polidocanol with intralesional excision (extended curettage with a high-speed burr) and bone grafting in patients with aneurysmal bone cysts.\n\nMethods: Ninety-four patients were randomly assigned to two treatment groups: Group 1 received sclerotherapy, and Group 2 underwent intralesional excision and bone grafting. The primary outcome was the healing rate, measured over a minimum follow-up of 3.2 years. Secondary outcomes included pain relief, time to healing and recurrence, hospital stay, and the Enneking functional score. Randomisation was conducted using a computer-generated sequence, with allocation concealment. Outcome assessors were blinded to treatment allocation.\n\nResults: Ninety-one patients were analysed (45 in Group 1 and 46 in Group 2) using an intention-to-treat approach. At last follow-up, healing was achieved in 93.3% of Group 1 and 84.8% of Group 2. Group 1 experienced minor complications that resolved, while Group 2 had three deep infections, five superficial infections, and two growth disturbances. Functional outcomes and hospital burden were worse in Group 2. The effect size for healing rates was not statistically significant, but the complication rate was notably higher in Group 2.\n\nInterpretation: Sclerotherapy with polidocanol is a minimally invasive and safer alternative to intralesional excision for treating aneurysmal bone cysts, offering similar healing rates with fewer complications. These findings suggest that sclerotherapy may be preferable, but larger studies are required for confirmation.\n\nTrial registration: [Trial registration number]\n\nFunding: [Source of funding]",
