This study evaluates current surgical practices and the feasibility of a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to compare bioprosthetic valves.\n\nMethods: An online survey was distributed to consultant congenital cardiac surgeons in adult congenital centres in the United Kingdom and Ireland. The survey gathered information on preferred prostheses, factors influencing decision-making, surgical techniques, postoperative management, and willingness to randomize patients to different prostheses in a trial.\n\nResults: Of 39 surgeons, 27 (69%) responded. Nineteen (70%) preferred an Edwards bovine pericardial valve, with the Inspiris Resilia model being the most common choice (7, 26%). Only 2 (7%) preferred the Hancock II valve, while 6 (22%) opted for pulmonary homografts. Long-term freedom from reintervention was the primary factor influencing prosthesis choice (23, 85%). A total of 22 (81%) surgeons were willing to randomize adult patients to either a bovine pericardial valve or a porcine xenograft, with Perimount Magna Ease and Hancock II being the most acceptable options. Willingness to randomize decreased to 11 (41%) for adolescent patients.\n\nInterpretation: The survey reveals significant heterogeneity in prosthesis selection and underscores the presence of clinical equipoise. Most surgeons are open to changing practice within a clinical trial, suggesting that a pragmatic, multicentre RCT comparing bovine pericardial and porcine xenograft valves for PVR in adults is feasible. Such a trial could provide critical evidence to guide valve choice, potentially improving patient outcomes and reducing the frequency of reinterventions. This study supports the need for randomized evidence to inform clinical practice in PVR.",
