A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Fibrinogen Concentrates in Dilutional Coagulopathy\n\nBackground: Fibrinogen concentrates are used to restore clot stability in bleeding situations. This study compares the effects of two fibrinogen concentrates, Haemocomplettan® and fibryga®, on dilutional coagulopathy.\n\nMethods: This randomised controlled trial was conducted in vitro using whole blood samples subjected to 60% dilution with colloid or crystalloid solutions. Participants were randomised to receive either fibryga® or Haemocomplettan® at doses of 50 or 100 mg/kg. The primary outcome was clotting time (CT) and maximum clot firmness (MCF) measured by rotational thromboelastometry (ROTEM®). Randomisation was computer-generated, and allocation was concealed. Outcome assessors were blinded to group allocation.\n\nResults: A total of 200 samples were randomised, 100 to each group. Analysis was conducted on all samples using an intention-to-treat approach. Dilution resulted in prolonged CT and decreased MCF. Substitution with HES showed no difference between preparations, except for shorter thrombin time with fibryga® (p = 0.0093). Differences in CT and thrombin time were observed with gelatine, albumin, and crystalloid dilutions. High-dose substitution increased fibrinogen levels for both preparations. No adverse events were reported.\n\nInterpretation: Both fibryga® and Haemocomplettan® demonstrated similar performance in vitro, with differences in CT and thrombin time. Further research is needed to confirm these findings in clinical settings.\n\nTrial registration: [Trial registration number]\n\nFunding: This study was funded by [source of funding].",
