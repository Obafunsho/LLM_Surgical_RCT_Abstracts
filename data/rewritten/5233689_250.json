A 250-word version\n\nTitle: A Randomised Controlled Trial of a Mobile Web Application to Enhance Knowledge of Increased Risk Donors Among Kidney Transplant Candidates\n\nBackground: Kidney transplant candidates (KTCs) often lack understanding of increased risk donors (IRDs). This study evaluated the efficacy of a mobile web application, Inform Me, in enhancing KTCs' knowledge about IRDs.\n\nMethods: In this multisite randomised controlled trial, KTCs undergoing evaluation at two transplant centers were randomised to receive either the Inform Me application following routine transplant education (intervention) or routine education alone (control). The primary outcome was knowledge about IRDs, assessed immediately after education (Tests 1 and 2) and one week later (Test 3). Randomisation was computer-generated, and allocation was concealed. Blinding was not applicable. A total of 288 participants were randomised: 144 to the intervention and 144 to the control group. Intention-to-treat analysis was performed.\n\nResults: Intervention participants had significantly higher Test 1 knowledge scores (mean difference=6.61; 95% CI, 5.37–7.86) compared to controls. Knowledge scores further increased with educational reinforcement (Test 2) compared to control Test 1 scores (mean difference=9.50; 95% CI, 8.27–10.73). After one week, intervention participants maintained higher knowledge scores than controls (mean difference=3.63; 95% CI, 2.49–4.78). Willingness to accept an IRD kidney did not differ between groups. No adverse events were reported.\n\nInterpretation: The Inform Me application significantly improved KTCs' knowledge about IRDs compared to routine education alone.
