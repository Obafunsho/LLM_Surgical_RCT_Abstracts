A 300-word version\n\nTitle: A Randomised Controlled Trial of Closed-Loop Vasopressor Control in Post-Cardiac Surgery Patients\n\nBackground: Vasopressors are crucial for managing vasodilatory hypotension. We developed a closed-loop vasopressor (CLV) controller to improve hypotension correction during the perioperative period. This study evaluated whether CLV management reduces hypotension compared to standard care in postcardiac surgery patients.\n\nMethods: In this randomised controlled trial, 40 patients admitted to the ICU after cardiac surgery were randomised into two groups. The CLV group received norepinephrine infusion controlled by the CLV system, while the control group had manual adjustments by ICU nurses. The primary outcome was the percentage of time with hypotension (MAP <65 mm Hg) over a 2-hour period. Randomisation was conducted using a computer-generated sequence, with allocation concealment ensured. Blinding was not applicable due to the nature of the intervention.\n\nResults: The CLV group experienced significantly less hypotension (1.4% [0.9–2.3]) compared to the control group (12.5% [9.9–24.3]; location difference, −9.8% [95% CI, −5.4 to −15.9]; P < .001). The percentage of time with MAP between 65 and 75 mm Hg was higher in the CLV group (95% [89–96] vs 66% [59–77]; location difference, 27.6% [95% CI, 34.3–19.0]; P < .001). The CLV group also had fewer instances of MAP >75 mm Hg (3.2% [1.9–5.4] vs 20.6% [8.9–32.5]; location difference, −17% [95% CI, −10 to −24]; P < .001). No adverse events were reported in either group.\n\nInterpretation: CLV control of norepinephrine infusion significantly reduces postoperative hypotension compared to manual control in ICU patients after cardiac surgery.\n\nTrial registration: [Trial registration number]\n\nFunding: [Source of funding]",
