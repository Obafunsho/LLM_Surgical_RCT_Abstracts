A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Guided vs Freehand Ventricular Catheter Placement\n\nBackground: Freehand ventricular catheter placement may have limited accuracy. This study investigates the accuracy of a guided ventricular catheter placement using a mobile health application.\n\nMethods: This multicenter, randomised controlled trial enrolled 139 eligible hydrocephalic patients across 9 centers from April 2013 to December 2014. Participants were randomised 1:1 to either guided or freehand catheter placement. The primary outcome was the rate of primary cannulation of grade I catheter position in the ipsilateral ventricle, assessed postoperatively. Secondary outcomes included the rate of intraventricular catheter perforations, early catheter failure, and complications. Randomisation was performed using an online password-protected database with allocation concealment. Outcome assessors were blinded.\n\nResults: In the intention-to-treat analysis, 70 patients were in the guided group and 69 in the freehand group. The primary endpoint was achieved in 70% of the guided group versus 56.5% in the freehand group (odds ratio 1.79, 95% CI 0.89-3.61). The primary successful puncture rate was 100% in the guided group versus 91.3% in the freehand group (p = 0.012). Catheter perforations were completely intraventricular in 81.4% of the guided group compared to 65.2% of the freehand group (odds ratio 2.34, 95% CI 1.07-5.1). No significant differences were observed in early catheter failure or complications.\n\nInterpretation: Guided ventricular catheter placement is a safe and simple method, showing a nonsignificant improvement in optimal catheter placement. Long-term follow-up is needed to assess differences in catheter survival. Trial registration: NCT01811589. Funding: Aesculap AG.",
