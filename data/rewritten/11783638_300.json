A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Initial Propofol Bolus Doses in Different TCI Pumps\n\nBackground: Target-controlled infusion (TCI) pumps are designed to deliver an initial bolus of propofol to achieve a preset target concentration rapidly. This study aims to investigate whether differences exist in the initial bolus dose between different TCI pumps, despite using the same pharmacokinetic (PK) model.\n\nMethods: Conducted as an observational study in a laboratory setting at a German University Hospital, experiments were performed from February 2019 to September 2020. Four TCI pumps were evaluated on 13 virtual patients with varying combinations of age, sex, height, and weight. The pumps were set to the Schnider model in effect-site mode with a target propofol concentration of 3.5 μg ml−1. Two pumps employed a fixed equilibration rate constant (ke0) of 0.456 min−1, while the other two used a fixed time to peak concentration (tpeak) of 1.6 min. The primary outcome was the propofol bolus dose, measured on a high precision scale.\n\nResults: The study found small differences in propofol bolus doses in some simulations, while significant differences were observed in others. For instance, a virtual 60-year-old, obese man received 72.0 ± 1.0 mg with a Perfusor Space pump and 111.9 ± 1.2 mg with an Alaris pump (P < 0.001).\n\nInterpretation: The observed discrepancies in initial bolus doses can be explained by differences in ke0. Anaesthetists should be aware of these variations in the implementation of the Schnider model between manufacturers, as they could lead to disparities in the initial propofol bolus in some patients. This awareness is crucial for ensuring accurate dosing and patient safety during anaesthesia induction.",
