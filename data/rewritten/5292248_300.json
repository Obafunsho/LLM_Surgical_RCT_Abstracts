A 300-word version\n\nTitle: A Multicenter, Cluster-Randomized Controlled Trial of a Standardized Smoking Cessation Intervention for Vascular Surgery Patients\n\nBackground: Effective smoking cessation is vital for patients undergoing vascular surgery, yet there is significant variability in practice. This study assesses a standardized intervention against usual care.\n\nMethods: This multicenter, cluster-randomized trial included eight centers, randomized to provide either a standardized smoking cessation intervention or usual care. The intervention comprised physician \"very brief advice,\" nicotine replacement therapy (NRT), and referral to a phone-based counseling service. Eligible participants were patients scheduled for vascular surgery or endovascular interventions. The primary outcome was smoking cessation rate at 6 months post-intervention. Randomization was conducted at the center level, with allocation concealment ensured. Due to the intervention's nature, blinding was not applicable.\n\nResults: A total of 142 patients were enrolled, with 71 in each group. In the intervention group, patients were more likely to receive physician advice (98% vs. 77%), NRT (77% vs. 13%), and quitline referral (93% vs. 33%) (all p<0.001). The analysis was conducted on an intention-to-treat basis. Final results on smoking cessation rates are forthcoming. No adverse events were reported in either group.\n\nInterpretation: The standardized smoking cessation intervention is feasible and significantly enhances the delivery of cessation support compared to usual care. Further analysis will elucidate its effectiveness in achieving smoking cessation.\n\nTrial registration: [Trial registration number]\n\nFunding: [Source of funding]",
