A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of DACC-Coated vs. Alginate Dressings for Pilonidal Sinus Wound Healing\n\nBackground: Pilonidal sinus disease is prevalent among young adults, with surgical excision and secondary intention healing as common management. This study aimed to compare wound healing using dialkylcarbamoyl chloride (DACC)-coated dressings versus alginate dressings.\n\nMethods: This multicentre, open-label randomised controlled trial involved 246 patients undergoing pilonidal sinus surgery across four French hospitals from December 2013 to September 2017. Participants were randomised to receive either DACC-coated or alginate dressings postoperatively. The primary outcome was the proportion of wounds healed at 75 days. Randomisation was computer-generated with allocation concealment via telephone. Blinding was not possible for patients or clinicians.\n\nResults: In per-protocol analysis, 78 of 103 patients (75.7%) in the DACC group and 58 of 97 (60%) in the alginate group had healed wounds at 75 days (odds ratio 2.55, 95% CI 1.12 to 5.92; P = 0.023). Adverse events included severe pain, hyperglycaemia, pregnancy, and hyperalgic inflammatory granulation in the alginate group.\n\nInterpretation: DACC-coated dressings significantly improved wound healing compared to alginate dressings, although the preplanned 20% improvement was not achieved. Trial registration: NCT02011802.\n\nFunding: Not specified.",
