A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Preoperative Home-Based Exercise Training on Quality of Life After Lung Cancer Surgery\n\nBackground: This randomised controlled trial evaluated the effect of preoperative home-based exercise training (PHET) on quality of life (QoL) after lung cancer surgery.\n\nMethods: Conducted at four hospitals in Portugal, patients aged ≥18 years with confirmed or suspected lung malignancy (stage IIIA or lower) were randomised 1:1 to PHET or control group (CG). PHET included aerobic and resistance exercises with weekly telephone supervision. The primary outcome was QoL, assessed using the EORTC QLQ-C30 at baseline, before surgery, and 1 month post-surgery. Randomisation used a computer-generated sequence with allocation concealment in sealed envelopes. Outcome assessors were blinded. Between September 2022 and May 2023, 46 patients were randomised (23 to each group).\n\nResults: Intention-to-treat analysis included 41 patients (20 PHET, 21 CG). A significant group × time interaction was found for global QoL (p = 0.004). PHET showed statistically and clinically significant improvements in global QoL before (mean difference [MD], 13.5; 95% CI, 2.4–24.6; p = 0.019) and after surgery (MD, 12.4; 95% CI, 1.3–23.4; p = 0.029). Adverse events were mild, with no serious events reported.\n\nTrial registration: NCT05469425.\n\nFunding: Not specified.",
