A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Ultrasound-Guided Percutaneous Cryoneurolysis for Traumatic Rib Fractures\n\nBackground: Traumatic rib fractures cause prolonged pain and reduced inspiratory capacity. This study evaluated the efficacy of ultrasound-guided percutaneous cryoneurolysis in improving analgesia and inspired volume.\n\nMethods: In a participant/observer-masked, randomised controlled trial, adults with one to six rib fractures were enrolled at the University of California-San Diego. Participants were randomised to active cryoneurolysis with sham peripheral nerve block or sham cryoneurolysis with active peripheral nerve block. Randomisation was stratified by laterality using sealed envelopes. The primary outcome was maximum inspired volume measured with an incentive spirometer the day after the procedure.\n\nResults: Between April 2020 and August 2023, 20 participants were randomised: 11 to cryoneurolysis and 9 to peripheral nerve block. The adjusted mean difference in maximum inspired volume was 793 ml greater in the cryoneurolysis group (95% CI, 273 to 1,312 ml; p = 0.005). Improvement from baseline was 1,000 ml for cryoneurolysis versus 300 ml for peripheral nerve block (p = 0.002). Average daily pain scores were lower in the cryoneurolysis group during the first month. Total cumulative oxycodone consumption was 5 mg for cryoneurolysis versus 45 mg for peripheral nerve block (p = 0.013). One adverse event of pneumonia occurred in the cryoneurolysis group.\n\nInterpretation: Cryoneurolysis significantly improves inspiratory volume and reduces pain and opioid use after rib fractures. These preliminary findings require confirmation in larger trials.\n\nTrial registration: NCT04198662\n\nFunding: Epimed International provided funding and devices.",
