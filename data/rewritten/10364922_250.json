A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Effect of Preoperative Physical Activity on Recovery after Breast Cancer Surgery: A Randomised Controlled Trial\n\nBackground: The impact of preoperative physical activity on recovery and complications following primary breast cancer surgery is unclear. This trial aimed to assess whether a recommendation for non-supervised physical activity enhances recovery post-surgery.\n\nMethods: This parallel, unblinded, multicentre trial randomised women scheduled for breast cancer surgery. Participants were recruited from a university and a county hospital in western Sweden. The intervention group received an individual recommendation for 30 minutes of daily aerobic physical activity before and 4 weeks after surgery. The control group received no physical activity advice. The primary outcome was patient-reported physical recovery at 4 weeks post-surgery. Secondary outcomes included mental recovery, complications, reoperations, and readmissions. Randomisation was performed using an online system with 1:1 allocation in permutated blocks. Neither participants nor outcome assessors were blinded.\n\nResults: Between November 2016 and December 2018, 400 patients were randomised (200 per group). At 4 weeks, 370 participants (180 intervention, 190 control) were analysed using an intention-to-treat approach. No significant difference was observed in physical recovery (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.13) or mental recovery (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.17). The mean Comprehensive Complication Index score was similar between groups (4.2 vs 4.7).\n\nInterpretation: Recommended non-supervised physical activity before and after breast cancer surgery did not improve recovery at 4 weeks post-surgery.
