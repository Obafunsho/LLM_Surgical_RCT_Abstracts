Preoperative ICG–TC injections were administered, followed by lymphoscintigraphy and SPECT-CT imaging. Intraoperative SLN detection was performed using fluorescence and a gamma probe. Postoperative analysis included fluorescence quantification by tumor-to-background ratio (TBR) and surgeon evaluation via a standardized questionnaire. The primary outcome was the intraoperative detection rate of SLNs.\n\nResults: SLNs were transcutaneously visible in 10/15 (67%) patients. Intraoperatively, 35/37 (95%) SLNs were fluorescent, and 37/37 (100%) were radioactive. ICG–TC led to the identification of six additional SLNs compared to preoperative imaging. The median in vivo TBR was 6.5 (IQR 5.3). No adverse events were reported.\n\nInterpretation: The addition of ICG to 99m technetium nanocolloid is a feasible and effective method for SLN detection in pediatric patients, demonstrating high detection rates and ease of use without adverse events. This method may improve SLN detection rates and reduce false negatives, enhancing the diagnostic value of the sentinel lymph node procedure (SNP).\n\nTrial registration: NL71166.041.20\n\nFunding: Not specified.",
