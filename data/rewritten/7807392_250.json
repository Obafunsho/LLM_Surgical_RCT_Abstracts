A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Postdischarge Video-Based Virtual Visits vs. In-Person Follow-Up\n\nBackground: Postdischarge video-based virtual visits have become increasingly common, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. This study evaluates the outcomes of 30-day hospital encounters among patients receiving virtual follow-up compared to in-person follow-up.\n\nMethods: This randomised, active, controlled noninferiority trial was conducted in an urban setting, involving patients from a small community hospital and a large tertiary care hospital. Eligible participants were those undergoing minimally invasive appendectomy or cholecystectomy. Patients were randomised in a 2:1 ratio to receive either video-based virtual visits or in-person visits. The primary outcome was the percentage of patients with a 30-day hospital encounter, defined as an emergency department visit, observation, or inpatient admission. Randomisation was performed using a computer-generated sequence, and allocation was concealed. Blinding was not applicable.\n\nResults: A total of 432 patients were randomised, with 289 in the virtual group and 143 in the in-person group. Analysis was conducted on an intention-to-treat basis. The hospital encounter rate was noninferior for virtual visits (12.8% vs. 13.3% for in-person, Δ 0.5% with 1-sided 95% CI, −∞ to 5.2%). No significant difference was found in clinician time (mean 8.4 minutes virtual vs. 7.8 minutes in-person; P = .30), but the median overall visit time was 27.5 minutes shorter for virtual visits (95% CI, −33.5 to −24.0). No adverse events were reported.\n\nInterpretation: Video-based virtual visits did not increase hospital encounter rates and reduced overall visit time, supporting their use in postdischarge care.\n\nTrial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03258177\n\nFunding: Not specified.",
