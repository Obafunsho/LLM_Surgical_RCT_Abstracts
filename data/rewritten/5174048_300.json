A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Imageless Navigation in Total Hip Arthroplasty\n\nBackground: Iliopsoas tendon impingement is a potential cause of persistent groin pain after THA. This study investigates whether imageless navigation reduces psoas impingement compared to standard techniques.\n\nMethods: This randomised controlled trial included 135 patients undergoing THA, randomised to surgery with or without imageless navigation. The primary outcome was the anterior protrusion of the cup above the acetabular rim, assessed postoperatively on 3-D CT by a blinded external institute. Randomisation was computer-generated, with allocation concealment. Outcome assessors were blinded. The study was conducted at a single orthopedic center. Eligibility criteria included patients scheduled for primary THA. The sample size was calculated to detect a clinically significant difference in cup positioning.\n\nResults: With the numbers available, no significant difference was observed between the navigated and control groups in mean distance of the cup below the anterosuperior acetabular rim (3.9 mm vs. 4.4 mm; p = 0.72) or anteroinferior rim (4.7 mm vs. 4.2 mm; p = 0.29). The proportion of cups with anterior overhang was similar (7% vs. 15%; p = 0.16). Cup anteversion (HR, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.81–0.93; p < 0.001) and female sex (HR, 3.88; 95% CI, 1.01–14.93; p = 0.049) were associated with potential psoas impingement. Clinical scores showed no differences between groups with and without anterior cup protrusion. No adverse events were reported.\n\nInterpretation: Imageless navigation did not significantly reduce potential psoas impingement compared to standard techniques. Surgeons should be aware of the increased risk in women. The trial was registered under [Trial Registration Number]. Funding was provided by [Funding Source].",
