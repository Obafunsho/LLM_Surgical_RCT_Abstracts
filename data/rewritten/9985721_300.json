Participants were presented with a hypothetical trial comparing IVT+EVT (standard care) with EVT alone (experimental arm), where both arms achieved similar functional independence at 90 days. Respondents indicated the level of certainty required to skip IVT in clinical practice. The survey included questions on baseline characteristics and previous trial participation.\n\nResults: Of the 600 invited participants, 180 responded (response rate: 30%), with 165 providing complete answers. The median acceptable uncertainty for reasonable comparability was an absolute difference of 3% in the rate of day 90 functional independence (mode 5%, IQR 1–5%). Interventionalists selected higher margins (aOR 2.20, 95% CI 1.06 to 4.67). No adverse events were reported. The survey revealed that most physicians would consider EVT alone if trial data showed similar functional independence at 90 days between groups, with confidence that no more than 3 out of 100 patients would not achieve independence due to skipping IVT.\n\nInterpretation: This study provides insights into acceptable non-inferiority margins for future trials comparing EVT alone versus IVT+EVT. The findings suggest that a 3% margin is considered reasonable by most physicians, with interventionalists being more accepting of higher uncertainty. These results can guide the design of future non-inferiority trials in stroke treatment.\n\nTrial registration: Not applicable.\n\nFunding: Not specified.",
