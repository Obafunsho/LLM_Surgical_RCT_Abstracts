Patients aged ≥8 years undergoing appendectomy for complex appendicitis were randomised to receive either 2 days or 5 days of intravenous antibiotics. Randomisation was performed using computerized block randomisation, stratified by center. The primary outcome was a composite of infectious complications and mortality within 90 days. The trial was registered in the Netherlands Trial Register (code NL5946).\n\nResults: A total of 1066 patients were randomised, with 502 in the 2-day group and 503 in the 5-day group. The intention-to-treat analysis included 1005 patients. The mean difference in overall societal costs was –€625 (95% CI: –€958 to –€278) favoring the 2-day group, primarily due to reduced hospital stay. Infectious complications and mortality were similar between groups (10.2% vs 8.2%; absolute risk difference 2.0%, 95% CI: –1.6 to 5.6). No significant differences in productivity losses were observed. No severe adverse events were reported.\n\nInterpretation: Two days of postoperative antibiotics for complex appendicitis is cost-effective and results in significant cost savings without compromising patient safety. These findings support the adoption of a 2-day antibiotic regimen in well-resourced healthcare settings.\n\nFunding: The trial was funded by [source not specified].",
