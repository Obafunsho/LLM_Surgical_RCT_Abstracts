A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Prehabilitation in Surgical Patients\n\nBackground: This randomised controlled trial aimed to evaluate the impact of prehabilitation on surgical outcomes. Prehabilitation includes exercise, nutrition, respiratory training, and psychosocial support to optimize patients' preoperative status.\n\nMethods: Participants were randomized into intervention and control groups. The sample size was calculated to detect a significant difference in postoperative outcomes. Eligibility criteria included adults undergoing surgery, with the study conducted in a hospital setting. The intervention group received a multimodal prehabilitation program, while the control group received standard care. The primary outcome was postoperative complication rate, measured within 30 days post-surgery. Randomisation was computer-generated, with allocation concealment using sealed envelopes. Blinding was applied to outcome assessors.\n\nResults: A total of 200 participants were randomised: 100 to the intervention and 100 to the control group, recruited between January 2020 and June 2021. Analysis included 98 participants in the intervention group and 97 in the control group, using an intention-to-treat approach. The intervention group showed a significant reduction in complications (mean difference = 5.2%, 95% CI 3.1 to 7.3; p = 0.01). Adverse events were mild, with 3% in the intervention and 1% in the control group experiencing gastrointestinal side-effects.\n\nInterpretation: Prehabilitation significantly improved surgical outcomes, supporting its integration into preoperative care. Further research should explore its application across diverse surgical specialties.\n\nTrial registration: NCT12345678\n\nFunding: This trial was funded by the National Institute of Health.",
