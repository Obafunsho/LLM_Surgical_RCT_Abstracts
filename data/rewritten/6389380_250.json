A 250-word version\n\nTitle: A Randomised Controlled Trial of Low Molecular Weight Dextran Sulfate in Islet Transplantation\n\nBackground: The instant blood-mediated inflammatory reaction (IBMIR) during intraportal islet transplantation leads to significant islet loss. This study evaluates the efficacy and safety of low molecular weight dextran sulfate (LMW-DS) compared to heparin in preventing IBMIR.\n\nMethods: The CIT-01 study was a phase II, multicenter, open-label, active control, randomized trial. Twenty-four subjects were randomized to receive either LMW-DS or heparin during islet transplantation. The primary outcome was stimulated C-peptide response measured 75±5 days post-transplant. Randomization was performed using a computer-generated sequence, and allocation was concealed. Blinding was not implemented due to the open-label design.\n\nResults: Twelve participants were randomized to each group. The primary outcome showed no significant difference between LMW-DS and heparin (1.33±1.10 vs. 1.56±1.36 ng/mL, p=0.66). Adverse events were similar between groups, primarily related to immunosuppression. Insulin requirements, metabolic parameters, and quality of life were comparable.\n\nInterpretation: LMW-DS demonstrated similar efficacy and safety to heparin in preventing IBMIR, suggesting its potential as an alternative treatment. Further studies with optimized dosing are warranted.\n\nTrial registration: [Trial registration number]\n\nFunding: [Source of funding]",
