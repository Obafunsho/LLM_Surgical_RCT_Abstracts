The trial was conducted during elective CABG. Continuous monitoring was performed using a Pressure Record Analytical Method (PRAM) to measure stroke volume index (SVI), CCE, and stroke volume variation (SVV). PAPP was derived from peak systolic aortic pressure and peak aortic blood flow velocity, while EF was estimated using TEE. In eight patients, dobutamine 2.5 μg/kg/min was administered before cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) to evaluate ventricular reserve.\n\nResults: Hemodynamic data showed no significant differences pre- and postoperatively. Strong correlations were observed between PAPP and CCE, SVI, and EF both pre- and postoperatively (P < 0.001). Dobutamine infusion resulted in improved PAPP values (2.4 ± 0.9 vs 3.2 ± 0.8) in all eight patients, although the small sample size precluded statistical analysis.\n\nInterpretation: PAPP, CCE, and EF are valuable for assessing ventricular performance in CABG patients using minimally invasive monitoring techniques. No adverse events were reported during the study.\n\nTrial registration: Not provided.\n\nFunding: Not disclosed.",
