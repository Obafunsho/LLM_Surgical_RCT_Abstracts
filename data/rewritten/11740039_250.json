This study evaluates the long-term outcomes of right common carotid artery (CCA) cannulation using a side graft for unilateral selective antegrade cerebral perfusion (uSACP).\n\nMethods: This retrospective study reviewed 343 patients who underwent elective ascending aortic or aortic arch surgery between 2013 and 2020. One hundred procedures used the right CCA as the sole arterial cannulation site under moderate hypothermic circulatory arrest (MHCA). The primary outcome was postoperative death from neurological causes, measured over a median follow-up of 5.4 years. The study was registered in the German clinical trials register.\n\nResults: The mean patient age was 65.9 years, with 81% male. The early mortality and stroke rates were 1% and 4%, respectively. After a median follow-up of 5.4 years, seven patients suffered a stroke, with a 92% survival rate at 6 years, comparable to an age- and gender-matched general population (log-rank P=0.50). Multivariable analysis identified age at surgery as the only significant predictor of late stroke or death (HR =1.083; P=0.01). Control Doppler ultrasound after a median of 2.3 years showed no injury or dissection of the right CCA.\n\nInterpretation: Right CCA cannulation is a safe and practical technique for proximal aortic surgery, yielding comparable short- and long-term outcomes. Careful patient selection and technique are crucial to minimize risks.\n\nTrial registration: German clinical trials register.\n\nFunding: Not specified.",
