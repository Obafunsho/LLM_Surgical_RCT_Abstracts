A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial Comparing Rubber Band Ligation and Hemorrhoidectomy for Grade III Hemorrhoids\n\nBackground: The optimal management of grade III hemorrhoids is debated. This trial compares the effectiveness of rubber band ligation (RBL) and hemorrhoidectomy.\n\nMethods: This multicenter, open-label, parallel-group, randomised controlled noninferiority trial was conducted across 10 hospitals in the Netherlands. Adults with symptomatic grade III hemorrhoids were eligible. Exclusion criteria included prior rectal/anal surgery and medical unfitness. Participants were randomised 1:1 to RBL or hemorrhoidectomy. The primary outcomes were 12-month health-related quality of life (HR-QoL) and recurrence rate. Randomisation was web-based with allocation concealment. No blinding was applied.\n\nResults: Eighty-seven patients were randomised (47 RBL, 40 hemorrhoidectomy) from October 2019 to September 2022. Analysis included 46 RBL and 33 hemorrhoidectomy patients. RBL was not noninferior to hemorrhoidectomy in HR-QoL (mean difference -0.045; 95% CI, -0.087 to -0.004). Recurrence was higher in the RBL group (48.8% vs 6.1%; absolute risk difference 43%, 95% CI, 25%-60%). Complication rates were similar between groups. Hemorrhoidectomy resulted in higher pain scores initially (VAS 4 vs 1; p = 0.002), but RBL allowed faster work resumption (1 vs 9 days; p = 0.021). Adverse events were comparable, with 6% in the RBL group and 12% in the hemorrhoidectomy group experiencing complications.\n\nInterpretation: Hemorrhoidectomy may offer better long-term outcomes for grade III hemorrhoids, while RBL provides quicker recovery with less initial pain. These findings can guide clinical decision-making. Trial registration: NCT04621695. Funding: Not specified.",
