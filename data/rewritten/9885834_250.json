Participants were adults aged 18-50 years, ASA physical status II-III, undergoing elective cardiac surgery with median sternotomy. Exclusion criteria included coronary artery bypass grafting, systemic hypertension, renal/hepatic failure, uncontrolled diabetes, LA allergy, coagulopathy, psychiatric illness, chronic opioid use, and lack of consent. The intervention group received a pre-induction TTPB with 30 mL of 0.2% ropivacaine, while the control group did not. The primary outcome was intraoperative haemodynamic response, measured by changes in MAP and HR, with secondary outcomes including perioperative fentanyl requirement and postoperative pain scores.\n\nResults: Fifteen patients were randomised, with 7 receiving TTPB and 8 in the control group. Three patients in the TTPB group and four in the control group required additional intraoperative fentanyl. The mean intraoperative fentanyl consumption was lower in the TTPB group (7.93 ± 1.16 µg kg−1). No adverse events related to the block were reported.\n\nInterpretation: Pre-induction TTPB may attenuate haemodynamic response to median sternotomy and reduce perioperative fentanyl requirement. Further trials with larger sample sizes are needed to validate these findings.\n\nTrial registration: Not provided.\n\nFunding: Not reported.",
