A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Tacrolimus Plus Prednisone in CIDP Management\n\nBackground: Chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP) is a chronic autoimmune disorder affecting the peripheral nervous system. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of tacrolimus plus prednisone (T&P) compared to prednisone monotherapy (PM) in CIDP maintenance treatment.\n\nMethods: This retrospective cohort study was conducted at Xuanwu Hospital, Capital Medical University, from April 2019 to June 2023. Participants were adults diagnosed with CIDP according to the 2021 EAN/PNS guidelines, with an INCAT disability score ≥2. The primary outcome was the response rate, defined as a ≥1-point improvement in INCAT score at 3, 6, and 12 months. Secondary outcomes included changes in I-RODS scores, monthly median daily prednisone dose, and relapse rate over 12 months. Safety was assessed by adverse event profiles.\n\nResults: Of 74 screened patients, 34 were included (16 T&P, 18 PM). The T&P group demonstrated significantly higher response rates at 3 and 6 months compared to PM, though this difference attenuated by 12 months. I-RODS improvements were significantly greater in the T&P group at all time points. The relapse rate was lower in the T&P group (12.5% vs 33.3%). The T&P group maintained significantly lower prednisone doses from month 2 onward, with higher prednisone discontinuation rates at 12 months (43.8% vs 11.1%). Both groups showed comparable safety profiles, with no serious adverse reactions reported.\n\nInterpretation: Tacrolimus plus prednisone therapy demonstrated superior clinical outcomes compared to prednisone monotherapy in CIDP maintenance treatment, including accelerated symptomatic improvement, reduced relapse risk, and facilitated corticosteroid tapering. The combination regimen maintained an acceptable safety profile without serious adverse events, supporting its corticosteroid-sparing role in CIDP management. Trial registration: Not applicable.
