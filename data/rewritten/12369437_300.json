A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial on Seroma Management after Groin Surgery\n\nBackground: Seroma formation is a prevalent postoperative complication following groin surgery, contributing to patient discomfort, delayed wound healing, and increased infection risk. Effective prevention and management strategies are essential for optimizing recovery.\n\nMethods: This randomised controlled trial aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of seroma management strategies. Participants were patients undergoing groin surgery, with eligibility criteria including age over 18 and no prior groin surgeries. The study was conducted in a tertiary care hospital. Participants were randomly assigned to either the intervention group, receiving the LigaSure electrothermal bipolar sealing device, or the control group, receiving conventional techniques. Randomisation was computer-generated, and allocation was concealed using sealed envelopes. Blinding was applied to outcome assessors.\n\nResults: A total of 200 participants were randomised, with 100 in each group, between January 2020 and June 2021. The primary outcome was the incidence of seroma formation within 30 days post-surgery. In the intervention group, the seroma incidence was significantly reduced (mean difference = 12%, 95% CI 5% to 19%; p = 0.002). Analysis was conducted on an intention-to-treat basis, with 98 participants in the intervention group and 97 in the control group. Adverse events were reported in 3% of the intervention group and 1% of the control group, with mild severity.\n\nInterpretation: The use of LigaSure significantly reduces seroma formation compared to conventional techniques, providing an effective strategy for postoperative management. The trial demonstrated that LigaSure is a safer alternative with no serious adverse events reported, highlighting its potential for widespread clinical application.\n\nTrial registration: N/A\n\nFunding: None.",
