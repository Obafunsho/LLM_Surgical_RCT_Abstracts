A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Highly Porous Metal Tibia in Total Knee Arthroplasty\n\nBackground: This randomised controlled trial aimed to compare the effectiveness of a highly porous metal tibia with a traditional modular cemented tibia in total knee arthroplasty (TKA) regarding survivorship, Knee Society scores, range of motion (ROM), and complications.\n\nMethods: From 2003 to 2006, 397 patients (age 67.8 ± 8.7 years; 54% female) were randomised into three groups: (1) traditional modular cemented tibia; (2) cemented highly porous metal tibia; and (3) uncemented highly porous metal tibia. Stratified randomisation was performed based on surgeon, patient’s age, sex, and body mass index. The primary outcome was survivorship at 5 years. Secondary outcomes included Knee Society scores, ROM, and complications. Radiographic assessments were conducted for alignment, radiolucency, and implant migration/loosening. Patients were followed until death, revision, or for a minimum of 2 years (mean, 5 years; range, 2–9 years). Four patients were lost to follow-up before 2 years.\n\nResults: Survivorship at 5 years was similar across groups (96.8% [1]; 97.6% [2]; 96.7% [3]; p = 0.59). No highly porous metal tibia was revised for aseptic loosening. Knee Society scores, ROM, and complication rates were comparable between groups.\n\nInterpretation: At 5 years, highly porous metal tibias provided comparable fixation durability and functional outcomes to traditional cemented tibias in TKA. Trial registration and funding details were not provided.",
