A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Total Arterial Revascularization vs. Single Internal Thoracic Artery with Saphenous Vein Graft in Elderly Patients Undergoing Off-Pump Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting\n\nBackground: This study aimed to evaluate whether total arterial revascularization (TAR) offers survival and freedom from major adverse cardiac or cerebrovascular events (MACCE) benefits in elderly patients with multivessel coronary artery disease undergoing off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting (OPCAB), compared to using a single internal thoracic artery (ITA) with additional saphenous vein graft (SVG).\n\nMethods: This single-center retrospective study included 598 patients aged >70 years who underwent coronary revascularization from August 2017 to July 2023. After excluding high-risk patients and those with SVG plus more than two arterial grafts, 428 patients remained. Propensity score matching was used to create TAR and single ITA + SVG groups with 1:1 ratio (100 patients in each group). The primary outcome was survival and MACCE-free rates over 5 years.\n\nResults: After matching, both groups had similar demographics. The survival (p = 0.410) and MACCE-free rates (p = 0.494) over 5 years were not significantly different between the two groups. Univariable analysis showed that TAR (HR = 0.74, 95% CI = 0.44–1.22, p = 0.233) and complete revascularization (HR = 0.61, 95% CI = 0.34–1.09, p = 0.094) were not significant risk factors for long-term mortality.\n\nInterpretation: Elderly patients who underwent OPCAB with total arterial grafting did not show survival or free-MACCE benefits over 5 years. Trial registration and funding details were not provided.",
