A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Simulated Altitude Exposure for Preoperative Optimisation\n\nBackground: Postoperative complications are linked to poor preoperative fitness and anaemia. Simulated altitude exposure may enhance cardiorespiratory and metabolic fitness and alleviate anaemia. This study aimed to evaluate the physiological effects of one week of simulated altitude in older sedentary volunteers.\n\nMethods: This randomised, double-blind, sham-controlled crossover trial was conducted at the National Altitude Training Centre, University of Limerick. Eight participants aged 50-70 years, with a sedentary lifestyle, were randomised to experience one week each of normoxic and hypoxic conditions (FIO2 15%, equivalent to 2438 m). The primary outcome was the change in anaerobic threshold, measured via cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) before and after each exposure. Randomisation was block-based, and participants, outcome assessors, and clinicians were blinded.\n\nResults: All eight participants completed the study. Hypoxia was mild (mean SpO2 93%) and well-tolerated. There was no significant effect on anaerobic threshold or peak VO2. However, hypoxia induced a significant increase in haemoglobin (mean increase 1.5 g/dl, 13%, p=0.028). No adverse events were reported.\n\nInterpretation: This study demonstrates the feasibility of 'altitude prehabilitation' and suggests potential for improving haematological fitness. Further research is needed to explore its role in preoperative optimisation.\n\nTrial registration: Not provided.\n\nFunding: Not specified.",
