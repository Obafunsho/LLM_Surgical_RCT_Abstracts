A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Tacrolimus Plus Prednisone in CIDP Management\n\nBackground: Chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP) is a chronic autoimmune disorder. This study evaluated the efficacy and safety of tacrolimus plus prednisone (T&P) versus prednisone monotherapy (PM) in CIDP maintenance treatment.\n\nMethods: This retrospective cohort study was conducted at Xuanwu Hospital, Capital Medical University, from April 2019 to June 2023. Participants were adults diagnosed with CIDP per 2021 EAN/PNS guidelines, with an INCAT disability score ≥2. The primary outcome was the response rate, defined as a ≥1-point improvement in INCAT score at 3, 6, and 12 months. Secondary outcomes included I-RODS score changes, monthly median daily prednisone dose, and relapse rate over 12 months. Safety was assessed by adverse event profiles.\n\nResults: Of 74 screened patients, 34 were included (16 T&P, 18 PM). The T&P group showed higher response rates at 3 and 6 months, with significant I-RODS improvements at all time points. The relapse rate was lower in the T&P group (12.5% vs 33.3%). T&P maintained lower prednisone doses from month 2, with higher discontinuation rates at 12 months (43.8% vs 11.1%). Both groups had comparable safety profiles, with no serious adverse events.\n\nInterpretation: Tacrolimus plus prednisone demonstrated superior clinical outcomes, including accelerated improvement, reduced relapse risk, and facilitated corticosteroid tapering, with an acceptable safety profile.
