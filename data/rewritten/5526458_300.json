METHODS: Conducted at 12 level-1 trauma centers, patients predicted to require MT were randomised to two transfusion ratios (1:1:1 vs. 1:1:2) as per the PROPPR trial. Eligibility was determined using the ABC score or clinician gestalt prediction of MT. The primary outcome was mortality, assessed at 24 hours and 30 days post-intervention. Randomisation was executed via a centralised system with concealed allocation. Blinding was not applicable to outcome assessors, patients, or clinicians. RESULTS: A total of 680 patients were randomised, with a median time from patient arrival to MT protocol activation of 9 minutes and a median time from MT activation to first cooler delivery of 8 minutes. Delays in MT activation and cooler delivery were significantly associated with prolonged time to hemostasis (coef 1.09, p=0.001 and coef 1.16, p<0.001) and increased mortality (OR 1.02, p=0.009 and OR 1.02, p=0.012). After adjusting for injury severity, physiology, resuscitation intensity, and treatment arm, increased time to cooler delivery was associated with higher mortality at 24 hours (OR 1.05, p=0.035) and 30 days (OR 1.05, p=0.016). No adverse events were reported in either group. INTERPRETATION: Delays in MT protocol activation and initial cooler delivery are linked to increased mortality and prolonged hemostasis. Each minute delay in cooler delivery increases mortality odds by 5%. Trial registration: [Trial registration number]. Funding: [Source of funding].",
