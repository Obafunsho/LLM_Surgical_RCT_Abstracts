A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Intrathecal Morphine Doses in Total Knee Arthroplasty\n\nBackground: Intrathecal morphine (ITM) is effective for postoperative analgesia in total knee arthroplasty (TKA) under spinal anesthesia. This study aims to compare two ITM doses to identify the optimal dose for analgesic efficacy and minimal side effects.\n\nMethods: Conducted at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, this retrospective, single-center study involved 75 patients undergoing primary TKA. Participants were randomized into three groups: a control group receiving continuous adductor canal block (CCACB) and two experimental groups receiving single-dose adductor canal block (SSACB) with either 100 mcg or 150 mcg of ITM. The primary outcome was oral morphine equivalents (OME) consumption within 24 hours post-surgery. Randomization was performed using a random numbers generator, and outcome assessors were blinded.\n\nResults: In the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU), both ITM groups experienced significantly lower OME consumption and pain scores compared to the control group (p<0.001). Cumulative OME at 24 hours was significantly lower in ITM groups (p=0.004). No significant differences in antiemetic use or ambulation distance were observed. No adverse events, including respiratory depression, were reported.\n\nInterpretation: ITM doses of 100 mcg and 150 mcg provide effective analgesia with a similar safety profile in TKA. The findings suggest that both doses are comparable in efficacy, and further research should explore higher ITM doses and broader patient populations to better understand the benefits and potential drawbacks of ITM in TKA surgery.\n\nTrial registration: Not provided.\n\nFunding: Not specified.",
