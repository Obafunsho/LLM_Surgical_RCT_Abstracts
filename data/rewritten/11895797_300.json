A 300-word version\n\nTitle: A Randomised Controlled Trial Comparing Dexmedetomidine and Ketorolac for Postoperative Pain Management in Appendectomy\n\nBackground: This study aimed to evaluate the preemptive/preventive effects of dexmedetomidine versus ketorolac on postoperative pain in appendectomy patients.\n\nMethods: Conducted at Shahid Mohammadi Hospital, Iran, 60 patients aged 18-65 years undergoing appendectomy were randomised into three groups: dexmedetomidine (n=20), ketorolac (n=20), and control (n=20). Eligibility criteria included ASA class I and II, excluding those with allergies, drug use, or complicated appendicitis. Randomisation was computer-generated with allocation concealment via sealed envelopes. Blinding included patients, outcome assessors, and clinicians. The primary outcome was VAS pain scores at 1, 3, 6, 12, and 24 hours postoperatively. Secondary outcomes included 24-hour cumulative fentanyl PCA dose. Sample size was calculated based on VAS scores from a pilot study.\n\nResults: Dexmedetomidine group showed significantly lower VAS scores at 12 and 24 hours (1.15 ± 1.98 and 0.95 ± 1.76, P=0.004 and P=0.003) compared to ketorolac and control. Cumulative fentanyl PCA was lower in the dexmedetomidine group (21.35 ± 11.77 mL) than control (40.35 ± 12.90 mL, P=0.003). No significant adverse events were reported. The ketorolac group required more fentanyl (28.35 ± 9.82 mL, P=0.629) than dexmedetomidine but less than control. Secondary outcomes such as changes in blood pressure, heart rate, and body temperature showed no significant differences among groups. Postoperative nausea and vomiting were comparable across groups.\n\nInterpretation: Dexmedetomidine demonstrated superior preemptive/preventive analgesic effects compared to ketorolac and control, reducing pain scores and fentanyl use postoperatively. The findings suggest dexmedetomidine as a more effective option for managing postoperative pain in appendectomy patients.\n\nTrial registration: IRCT20140615018091N9\n\nFunding: Not specified.",
