A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Dendritic Cell and Poxvector Vaccines in Colorectal Cancer\n\nBackground: Recurrences after complete resections of metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC) are frequent. This study evaluates whether vaccines based on dendritic cells (DCs) and poxvectors encoding carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and MUC1 (PANVAC) improve survival in patients with resected CRC metastases.\n\nMethods: In this randomised controlled trial, 74 patients disease-free after CRC metastasectomy and perioperative chemotherapy were randomised to receive either autologous DCs modified with PANVAC (DC/PANVAC) or PANVAC with granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF). The primary outcome was recurrence-free survival at 2 years. Secondary outcomes included overall survival and CEA-specific immune responses. Randomisation was computer-generated, and allocation was concealed. Blinding was not specified. The study was conducted at [study setting].\n\nResults: At 2 years, recurrence-free survival was 47% for DC/PANVAC and 55% for PANVAC/GM-CSF (χ2 P = 0.48). At a median follow-up of 35.7 months, there were 2 deaths in the DC/PANVAC arm and 5 in the PANVAC/GM-CSF arm. T-cell responses against CEA were similar between groups. Vaccinated patients had superior survival compared to an unvaccinated contemporary group.\n\nInterpretation: Both DC and poxvector vaccines showed similar activity. Vaccinated patients demonstrated longer survival than unvaccinated patients, suggesting further trials comparing poxvector vaccinations with standard follow-up are warranted.
