Patients received preoperative ICG–TC injections, followed by lymphoscintigraphy and SPECT-CT imaging. Intraoperative SLN detection was performed using fluorescence and a gamma probe. Postoperative analysis included fluorescence quantification and surgeon evaluation via a standardized questionnaire. The primary outcome was the detection rate of SLNs, measured intraoperatively.\n\nResults: SLNs were transcutaneously visible in 10/15 (67%) patients. Intraoperatively, 35/37 (95%) SLNs were fluorescent, and 37/37 (100%) were radioactive. ICG–TC identified six additional SLNs compared to preoperative imaging. The median in vivo tumor-to-background ratio (TBR) was 6.5 (IQR 5.3). No adverse events were reported.\n\nInterpretation: ICG–TC is a feasible and effective method for SLN detection in pediatric patients, demonstrating high detection rates and ease of use without adverse events.\n\nTrial registration: NL71166.041.20\n\nFunding: Not specified.",
