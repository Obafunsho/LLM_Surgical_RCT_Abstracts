A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Virtual Reality vs. Noninteractive Visual Distraction in Pediatric Orthopaedic Procedures\n\nBackground: This randomised controlled trial assessed the effectiveness of virtual reality (VR) gaming simulation versus noninteractive visual distraction (VR goggles or tablet video) in reducing pain and anxiety in pediatric patients undergoing in-office orthopaedic procedures.\n\nMethods: Conducted at a single urban tertiary institution, the study included children scheduled for cast or percutaneous pin removal. Participants were randomly assigned to one of three groups: VR gaming simulation, VR goggles with a noninteractive video, or a tablet computer with the same video. The primary outcomes were preprocedure-to-maximum heart rate increase and preprocedure to postprocedure visual analog scale (VAS) scores for pain and anxiety. Randomisation was performed using a computer-generated sequence, and allocation was concealed. Blinding was not specified. The study enrolled 235 patients, with 210 included in the final analysis (mean age 9 ± 3 years; 48% girls).\n\nResults: In the cast removal cohort, no significant differences were found between groups in heart rate increase (18 ± 21 bpm vs. 14 ± 11 bpm vs. 20 ± 16 bpm; largest mean difference -6 bpm [95% CI -16 to 3]; p = 0.36) or VAS pain (1 ± 1 vs. 1 ± 2 vs. 0 ± 2; largest mean difference 0 points [95% CI 0 to 1]; p = 0.89). Similar results were observed in the pin removal cohort. No adverse events were reported.\n\nInterpretation: Simple distraction techniques like tablet video viewing are as effective as VR in minimizing procedural pain and anxiety. The findings suggest that widespread use of VR in pediatric orthopaedic outpatient settings is unnecessary due to costs and logistics. Trial registration and funding details were not provided.",
