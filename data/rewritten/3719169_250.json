This study evaluates whether EVD laterality affects blood clearance from the ventricular system, with and without thrombolytic agents.\n\nMethods: In this randomised controlled trial, 100 patients from two CLEAR Phase II trials were assessed. Participants were randomised to receive either thrombolytic agents or placebo through the EVD. The primary outcome was the rate of IVH clearance over the first 3 days, measured by CT scans. Randomisation was computer-generated, with allocation concealment ensured by sealed envelopes. Blinding was applied to outcome assessors.\n\nResults: Thrombolytic administration significantly enhanced IVH clearance compared to placebo, irrespective of EVD laterality (p < 0.005, CI −14.0, −4.14 for contralateral and CI −24.7, −5.44 for ipsilateral EVD). A trend suggested faster clearance with EVD on the side of dominant blood when thrombolytics were used (P = 0.09; CI −9.62, 0.69). No significant difference was observed with placebo. EVD laterality did not affect 3rd and 4th ventricular blood clearance.\n\nInterpretation: EVD placement may be optimized for total IVH clearance with thrombolytics. Both sides clear the 3rd and 4th ventricles equally. No adverse events were reported. Trial registration: [Trial registration number]. Funding: [Source of funding].",
