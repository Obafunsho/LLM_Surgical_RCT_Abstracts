Randomisation was computer-generated with allocation concealment using sealed envelopes. Blinding included patients, clinicians, and outcome assessors. The primary outcome was the duration of analgesia, measured until the first rescue analgesic was required.\n\nResults: The median duration of analgesia was 380 minutes for Group D, 360 minutes for Group C, and 405 minutes for Group M, with no statistically significant difference (P = 0.843). Adverse events included intraoperative hypotension in 43.5% of Group D, 27.8% of Group C, and 22.7% of Group M (P = 0.299). No significant differences in postoperative nausea, vomiting, or sedation were observed.\n\nInterpretation: Morphine, dexmedetomidine, and clonidine provide similar analgesic duration and side-effect profiles in pediatric infraumbilical surgeries.
