This study aimed to evaluate radiographic progression of degenerative joint disease, changes in pseudarthrosis height, and the association of degenerative changes with clinical outcomes.\n\nMethods: In this randomised controlled trial, 54 participants with painful trapeziometacarpal joint osteoarthritis were randomised to receive either simple trapeziectomy (n=25) or trapeziectomy with ligament reconstruction and tendon interposition (LRTI) (n=29). Randomisation was performed using a computer-generated sequence with allocation concealment. Blinding was applied to outcome assessors. Radiographic changes were assessed using the Kellgren and Lawrence system, and clinical outcomes were measured using the Patient Evaluation Measure (PEM), Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) questionnaires, and thumb key pinch strength at 1-year and 6-year follow-ups.\n\nResults: Increased degenerative changes were observed in 7/25 simple trapeziectomy cases and 1/29 LRTI cases. Pseudarthrosis space was preserved in 22/25 simple trapeziectomies and 28/29 LRTI cases. No significant differences in PEM, DASH, or pinch strength were found between groups. No adverse events were reported.\n\nInterpretation: Simple trapeziectomy showed more degenerative changes, but these did not impact clinical outcomes. The study was registered under trial number [insert number] and funded by [insert source].",
