A 250-word version\n\nTitle: The Effect of Popliteus Tendon Resection on Knee Stability in Total Knee Arthroplasty: A Randomised Controlled Trial\n\nBackground: The role of the popliteus tendon in total knee arthroplasty (TKA) remains unclear. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of popliteus tendon resection on knee ligament balancing and load distribution during TKA.\n\nMethods: This randomised controlled trial included 18 patients scheduled for posterior stabilized TKA, conducted at a single surgical center. Participants were randomly assigned to two groups: Group A (n=9) underwent popliteus tendon resection, while Group B (n=9) did not. Randomisation was achieved using a computer-generated sequence, and allocation was concealed. The primary outcome was knee stability, assessed intraoperatively by a blinded senior surgeon. A parallel cadaveric study evaluated load distribution using an instrumented tibial plateau sensor. The analysis was per-protocol.\n\nResults: The senior surgeon detected no difference in knee stability between the groups. In vitro studies showed no change in load distribution on the tibial plateau after popliteus tendon resection. No adverse events were reported in either group.\n\nInterpretation: Popliteus tendon resection does not affect static knee balance or load distribution during TKA. These findings suggest that the popliteus tendon may not be critical for knee stability in TKA.\n\nTrial registration: [Trial registration number]\n\nFunding: [Source of funding]",
