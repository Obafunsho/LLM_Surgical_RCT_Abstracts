This study evaluates the effectiveness of endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) compared to open surgical repair (OSR) in patients fit for surgery and EVAR versus best medical care in those unfit for surgery.\n\nMethods: This multicenter randomised controlled trial included participants based on surgical fitness. Randomisation was conducted using a computer-generated sequence with allocation concealment. Due to the nature of the interventions, blinding was not feasible. The primary outcome was short-term mortality, assessed within 30 days post-intervention. Secondary outcomes included intermediate and long-term mortality, reintervention rates, and complications.\n\nResults: A total of 2790 participants were randomised: 1362 to EVAR and 1361 to OSR. Short-term mortality was significantly lower in the EVAR group (1.4% vs. 4.2%, OR 0.33, 95% CI 0.20 to 0.55; P < 0.0001). No significant differences were observed in intermediate (15.8% vs. 17%, OR 0.92, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.12; P = 0.40) or long-term mortality (37.3% vs. 37.8%, OR 0.98, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.15; P = 0.78). Reintervention rates were higher in the EVAR group (OR 1.98, 95% CI 1.12 to 3.51; P = 0.02). Pulmonary complications were more frequent in the OSR group (OR 0.36, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.75; P = 0.006).\n\nInterpretation: EVAR is associated with lower short-term mortality compared to OSR in fit individuals, but this benefit does not persist long-term. The higher reintervention rate in EVAR requires consideration. Trial registration: Not provided. Funding: Not disclosed.",
