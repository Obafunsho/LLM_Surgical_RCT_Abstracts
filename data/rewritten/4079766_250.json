A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Bypass Angioplasty Revascularization Investigation 2 Diabetes (BARI 2D): A Randomised Controlled Trial\n\nBackground: BARI 2D evaluated management strategies for diabetic patients with myocardial ischemia and coronary artery disease. The study aimed to compare early revascularization with medical management and insulin sensitization with insulin provision.\n\nMethods: This randomised controlled trial used a 2 × 2 factorial design. Participants were diabetic patients with myocardial ischemia and multivessel coronary artery disease. They were recruited from multiple centers. Randomisation was performed using a computer-generated sequence, and allocation was concealed. Blinding was not applicable due to the nature of the interventions. The primary outcome was the rate of subsequent myocardial infarction, measured over a follow-up period. A total of 347 patients were randomised to early coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) or medical management. Analysis was conducted on an intention-to-treat basis.\n\nResults: Of the 347 patients, 173 were randomised to early CABG and 174 to medical management. Early CABG resulted in a significant reduction in myocardial infarction rates compared to medical management (hazard ratio = 0.70, 95% CI 0.50 to 0.98; p = 0.04). Perioperative morbidity and mortality were low, with no significant differences in adverse events between groups.\n\nInterpretation: Early CABG in diabetic patients with myocardial ischemia and multivessel disease significantly reduced myocardial infarction rates. The findings support the use of early surgical intervention in this population. Trial registration: NCT00006305. Funding: National Institutes of Health.",
