A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Long-term Impact of Mesh Type on Chronic Pain in Open Anterior Inguinal Hernia Repair: A Randomised Controlled Trial\n\nBackground: This randomised controlled trial evaluated the long-term impact of heavyweight versus lightweight mesh on chronic pain following open anterior inguinal hernia repair.\n\nMethods: Conducted between 2007 and 2009 at Umeå University Hospital and Östersund Hospital, Sweden, the trial included men aged 25 years or older with symptomatic unilateral inguinal hernia. Participants were randomised (1:1) to receive either heavyweight (90 g/m²) or lightweight (28 g/m²) mesh. The primary outcome was chronic pain affecting daily activities, measured by the Short-Form Inguinal Pain Questionnaire 9–12 years post-surgery. Randomisation was computer-generated, and allocation was concealed via a web-based server. Blinding was not achieved.\n\nResults: Of 412 randomised patients, 363 were analysed, with 271 completing the follow-up (121 heavyweight, 150 lightweight). Pain affecting daily activities was significantly less in the lightweight group (generalized odds 1.33, 95% CI 1.10 to 1.61; p = 0.004), translating to a number needed to treat of 7.06 (95% CI 4.28 to 21.44). Reoperations for recurrence were two in the heavyweight group and one in the lightweight group. No significant adverse events were reported.\n\nInterpretation: Lightweight mesh significantly reduces chronic pain affecting daily activities a decade after surgery. Trial registration: NCT00451893.\n\nFunding: The study was funded by Umeå University.",
