The trial was conducted across multiple institutions, with eligibility criteria including patients with suspected lung adenocarcinomas. IMI was performed during lung inspection, tumor resection, and margin check. The primary outcome was the occurrence of clinically significant events (CSE) that led to surgical modification or cancer up-staging. Safety was assessed for a single intravenous dose of OTL38.\n\nResults: Of 110 patients recruited, 92 were eligible for analysis. IMI identified 24 additional nodules during lung inspection, 9 of which were occult cancers. During tumor resection, IMI located 11 lesions not found by the surgeon. Margin check revealed 8 positive margins initially thought negative. No serious adverse events were reported. The benefits were notable in sublobar resections and ground-glass opacities. All surgeons were comfortable with the procedure after 10 cases.\n\nInterpretation: IMI improved surgical outcomes in 26% of patients, demonstrating its potential utility in pulmonary resections. A Phase 3 trial is underway to further evaluate its efficacy.\n\nTrial registration: NCT02872701\n\nFunding: Not specified.",
