A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Ultrasound-Guided Greater Occipital Nerve Block with Botulinum Toxin for Chronic Occipital Headache\n\nBackground: This randomised controlled trial assessed the efficacy of ultrasound-guided greater occipital nerve (GON) block using botulinum toxin for chronic occipital headache.\n\nMethods: Conducted at Hanyang University Guri Hospital, 54 patients aged 18-85 with chronic occipital headache were randomised into two groups: bupivacaine (BUP, n=27) and botulinum toxin (BTX, n=27). The primary outcome was pain reduction measured by the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) over 24 weeks. Secondary outcomes included patient satisfaction and anatomical parameters. Randomisation was performed using a closed-envelope technique, and allocation was concealed. Blinding was maintained for patients, clinicians, and outcome assessors. The sample size was calculated to detect a 20 mm difference in VAS scores with 80% power and a 0.05 significance level.\n\nResults: The VAS scores at 4, 8, and 24 weeks were significantly lower in the BTX group compared to the BUP group (p<0.05). Patient satisfaction scores were also higher in the BTX group at these time points. No adverse events were reported in either group. The analysis was conducted on an intention-to-treat basis, with 48 patients completing the study.\n\nInterpretation: Ultrasound-guided GON block with botulinum toxin is effective for long-term pain reduction and patient satisfaction in chronic occipital headache. The trial was registered under number 20110021167 and funded by Hanyang University Guri Hospital. The findings support the use of botulinum toxin as a superior alternative to bupivacaine for this condition.",
