This study aims to evaluate the incidence, management, and impact of graft delamination on the long-term patency of ecAVGs.\n\nMethods: A retrospective cohort study was conducted at the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, China, from April 2017 to December 2021. Participants included 141 end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients requiring ecAVG for HD. A total of 144 ecAVGs were analyzed, comprising 124 Acuseal and 20 Flixene grafts. The primary outcome was the incidence of graft delamination, measured over a median follow-up of 24.5 months. The study also assessed the effectiveness of different treatment modalities, including percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA), stenting, and partial graft replacement (PGR).\n\nResults: Thirteen (9.0%) ecAVGs experienced graft delamination, with an incidence of 0.04 per patient-year. The primary patency in the delamination group was significantly lower than in the non-delamination group (p < 0.05). Post-procedure primary patency was 1.3 months for PTA, 5.3 months for stenting, and 8.45 months for PGR (p = 0.029). Adverse events included thrombosis and venous hypertension, with seven delaminations observed shortly after endovascular procedures.\n\nInterpretation: Graft delamination is not a rare complication in ecAVGs and significantly reduces long-term patency. Partial graft replacement may offer better outcomes than endovascular treatments. The study highlights the need for careful monitoring and management of ecAVG delamination to improve patient outcomes. Further research is warranted to develop optimized treatment strategies.",
