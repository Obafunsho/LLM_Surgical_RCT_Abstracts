Participants were patients undergoing mastectomy without reconstruction. The intervention was the quilt technique, compared to conventional closure. The primary outcome was textbook outcome, defined as the absence of wound complications, readmissions, reoperations, unscheduled outpatient visits, and no increase in pain medication use 6 months post-surgery. Randomisation was by cluster, with allocation concealment ensured. Blinding was not feasible for patients or clinicians.\n\nResults: A total of 251 patients were included, with 179 in the quilted cohort and 72 in the non-quilted cohort. The quilted cohort had a higher incidence of textbook outcome (65.7% vs. 41.3%, odds ratio: 2.95, 95% CI: 1.45, 6.24, P = 0.003). Clinically significant seroma was less frequent in the quilted group (24.0% vs. 55.6%, P < 0.001). No significant differences were observed in postoperative pain, shoulder function, satisfaction, or cosmetic outcomes. No adverse events were reported.\n\nTrial Registration: NCT05272904, ClinicalTrials.gov.\n\nFunding: Not specified.",
