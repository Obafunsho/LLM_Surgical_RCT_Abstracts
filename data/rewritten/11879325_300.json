A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Suture UMbilical MEsh Repair (SUMMER) Trial: A Randomised Controlled Trial\n\nBackground: This trial evaluates surgical-site occurrences (SSOs) in suture versus mesh repair for umbilical hernias (UHs) ≤2 cm.\n\nMethods: A randomised, controlled, parallel-group, double-blind, multicentre trial was conducted across six Swedish surgical units. Participants were randomised 1:1 to either 4 × 4 cm macroporous lightweight onlay mesh repair or conventional suture repair. The primary outcome is recurrence at 3 years, with secondary outcomes including SSOs and pain intensity at 30 days. Intraoperative web-based randomisation ensured allocation concealment. Blinding included patients and outcome assessors.\n\nParticipants: Adults with primary elective UHs ≤2 cm were eligible. From February 2020 to January 2024, 290 participants were randomised: 146 to suture repair and 144 to mesh repair.\n\nResults: After exclusions, 144 suture and 135 mesh participants were analysed. SSOs (Clavien–Dindo grade ≥I) affected 32 mesh (23.7%) and 26 suture (18.1%) participants, with no significant increase for mesh (OR 1.39, 95% CI 0.78 to 2.51). Clinically relevant SSOs (Clavien–Dindo grade ≥II) were less common in mesh (1.5%) than suture (2.8%). Median surgery duration was 32 min for suture and 45 min for mesh (P < 0.001). Pain intensity showed 82.0% of suture and 73.0% of mesh participants reported no pain (P = 0.061). Adverse events were similar between groups, with no severe complications reported.\n\nInterpretation: Onlay mesh repair is comparable to suture repair regarding early SSOs and is safe for smaller UHs. The trial provides high-level evidence supporting mesh repair for UHs ≤2 cm, with implications for future surgical practice.\n\nTrial registration: NCT04231071.\n\nFunding: Not specified.",
