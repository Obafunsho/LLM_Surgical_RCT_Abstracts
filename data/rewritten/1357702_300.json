A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial Comparing Surgical Resection and Percutaneous Ethanol Injection for Small Hepatocellular Carcinoma\n\nBackground: This study aimed to evaluate disease recurrence and survival in patients with small hepatocellular carcinoma treated with surgical resection or percutaneous ethanol injection therapy.\n\nMethods: In this randomised controlled trial, 76 patients with one or two tumors ≤3 cm, hepatitis without cirrhosis, or Child class A or B cirrhosis without ascites or bleeding tendency were enrolled. Participants were randomly assigned to surgical resection or percutaneous ethanol injection groups. The primary outcome was disease recurrence and survival, assessed over a follow-up period of 12 to 59 months. Randomisation was conducted using a computer-generated sequence, and allocation was concealed. Blinding was not applicable due to the nature of the interventions.\n\nResults: A total of 38 patients were randomised to each group. In the percutaneous injection group, 18 patients experienced recurrence, and 3 died of cancer at 25, 37, and 57 months post-treatment. In the surgical resection group, 15 patients had recurrence, and 5 died of cancer at 11, 20, 23, 26, and 52 months. Cox regression and Kaplan-Meier analysis indicated no significant difference in recurrence and survival between groups. Tumor size >2 cm and alpha-fetoprotein >200 ng/mL were associated with higher recurrence, while Child class B cirrhosis correlated with shorter survival. No significant adverse events were reported in either group.\n\nInterpretation: Percutaneous ethanol injection therapy is as safe and effective as surgical resection for small hepatocellular carcinoma, providing a viable first-line treatment option. Trial registration and funding details were not provided, limiting the assessment of trial transparency and potential biases. Further research is needed to confirm these findings in larger, multicenter trials.",
