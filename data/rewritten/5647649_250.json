A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Preoperative and Postoperative Imatinib in Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumor (GIST) Patients\n\nBackground: Gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) is a common sarcoma in the gastrointestinal tract. This study evaluates the safety and efficacy of preoperative and postoperative imatinib in GIST patients undergoing surgical resection.\n\nMethods: This randomised, phase II trial was conducted at MDACC, TX, USA, from August 2003 to March 2007. Eligible patients had histologically confirmed kit-expressing GIST ≥ 1 cm, untreated with chemotherapy. Nineteen patients were randomised to receive 3, 5, or 7 days of preoperative imatinib (300 mg twice daily) and 2 years of postoperative imatinib (600 mg daily). The primary outcome was tumor cell apoptosis, measured postoperatively. Randomisation was performed by the institutional department of biostatistics, with allocation concealment. Blinding was applied to outcome assessors.\n\nResults: Nineteen patients were randomised, and 17 were analysed. Tumor cell apoptosis increased by an average of 12% (p = 0.04). Median disease-free survival (DFS) was 46 months. Tumor size predicted recurrence (p = 0.02). Adverse events were similar to an imatinib-naïve cohort (p ≥ 0.1). No deaths occurred.\n\nInterpretation: Imatinib is safe and effective for GIST patients undergoing resection, with radiographic response and apoptosis occurring within the first week. Trial registration: Not provided. Funding: No funding source influenced the study.",
