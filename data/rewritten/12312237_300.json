This study aimed to determine the maximum effective volume (MEV90) of 0.25% ropivacaine to prevent HDP in 90% of patients.\n\nMethods: This prospective, randomised controlled trial was conducted at Changzheng Hospital. Participants were adults aged 46-80 years, ASA I-III, scheduled for shoulder arthroscopy. Exclusion criteria included respiratory comorbidities. A biased coin design was used for volume assignment, with randomisation and allocation concealment achieved through sealed envelopes. The primary outcome was HDP occurrence, assessed 3 hours post-block. Blinding was maintained for outcome assessors, patients, and clinicians.\n\nResults: Fifty-two patients were randomised and analysed. The MEV90 of 0.25% ropivacaine for ultrasound-guided STB was estimated at 7.6 mL (95% CI: 6.5–8.5 mL) using isotonic regression. Sensory block duration varied with volume, with no adverse events reported.\n\nInterpretation: The study identified 7.6 mL as the MEV90 of 0.25% ropivacaine for STB, providing a diaphragm-sparing alternative for patients undergoing shoulder arthroscopy. This volume threshold is particularly advantageous for high-risk respiratory patients, offering optimal pulmonary function preservation.\n\nTrial registration: Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (ChiCTR2200059042); first registered 23/04/2022.\n\nFunding: Not specified.",
