A 300-word version\n\nTitle: A Randomised Controlled Trial Comparing Pressure-Controlled and Volume-Controlled Ventilation in Rhinoplasty\n\nBackground: Intraoperative bleeding poses a major challenge in rhinoplasty, impacting surgical visibility and patient outcomes.\n\nMethods: This double-blind, randomised controlled trial was conducted at Hazrat-e Fatemeh Hospital, Iran University of Medical Sciences, between 2021 and 2022. Sixty patients, aged 18-50 years and classified as ASA I or II, were randomised to receive either pressure-controlled ventilation (PCV) or volume-controlled ventilation (VCV) during rhinoplasty. Randomisation was performed using a table of random numbers, with allocation concealed in sealed envelopes. Both patients and surgeons were blinded to the intervention. The primary outcome, intraoperative bleeding, was assessed by weighing blood-soaked gauze and measuring suctioned fluid during the surgery.\n\nResults: Fifty-eight patients completed the study, with 31 in the PCV group and 27 in the VCV group. The mean intraoperative bleeding volume was 30 ± 45 mL in the PCV group and 100 ± 120 mL in the VCV group (P < 0.001). Logistic regression analysis indicated that the odds of experiencing moderately severe or severe bleeding were 5.4 times higher in the VCV group, increasing to 26.8 (95% CI = 1.2, 59.3) after adjusting for confounders. No adverse events were reported in either group.\n\nInterpretation: The study demonstrates that PCV mode significantly reduces intraoperative bleeding compared to VCV mode, likely due to decreased peak airway pressure. These findings suggest that PCV should be considered in rhinoplasty to enhance surgical outcomes and patient safety. Trial registration: IRCT20101026005026N13. Funding: Not specified. Further research with larger sample sizes and multi-center trials is recommended to validate these findings and explore the broader applicability of PCV in surgical settings.",
