A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial Comparing Partial and Circumferential Stapled Hemorrhoidopexy\n\nBackground: The long-term efficacy and safety of partial stapled hemorrhoidopexy (PSH) compared to circumferential stapled hemorrhoidopexy (CSH) for grade III/IV hemorrhoids are not well established.\n\nMethods: This single-center, parallel-group, randomised, noninferiority trial was conducted at The Sixth Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-Sen University. A total of 300 patients with grade III/IV hemorrhoids were recruited between August 2011 and November 2013. Participants were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either PSH (n = 150) or CSH (n = 150) using blocked randomisation with a fixed block size of 4. Allocation was concealed using sealed envelopes. Patients and outcome assessors were blinded to the intervention. The primary outcome was the rate of recurrent prolapse at a median follow-up of 5 years, with a noninferiority margin of 3.75%. Secondary outcomes included postoperative pain, fecal urgency, anal continence, and complications.\n\nResults: The 5-year cumulative recurrence rate was 9% (95% CI, 4%–13%) for PSH and 12% (95% CI, 7%–17%) for CSH (p = 0.137). PSH was associated with less postoperative pain (p < 0.001) and urgency (p = 0.001), and no rectal stenosis, compared to 5% in CSH (p = 0.004). Adverse events were minimal in both groups.\n\nInterpretation: PSH is noninferior to CSH for grade III/IV hemorrhoids, with advantages in postoperative outcomes.
