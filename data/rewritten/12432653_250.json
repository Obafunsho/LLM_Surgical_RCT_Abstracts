A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial on Thoracic Drainage Strategies in Lung Cancer Surgery\n\nBackground: This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of different thoracic drainage strategies following lung cancer surgery, focusing on digital versus analogue drainage systems and suction versus water seal.\n\nMethods: This randomised controlled trial was conducted at a tertiary care hospital. Participants were patients undergoing lung cancer surgery, with eligibility criteria including age 18-75 and no prior thoracic surgery. A total of 200 participants were randomised: 100 to the digital drainage system group and 100 to the analogue drainage system group. Randomisation was computer-generated, and allocation was concealed using sealed envelopes. Blinding was not feasible due to the nature of the intervention.\n\nIntervention: The intervention group received digital drainage systems, while the control group received analogue systems. The primary outcome was drainage duration, measured over a 30-day postoperative period.\n\nResults: In the intention-to-treat analysis, 98 participants in the digital group and 97 in the analogue group were analysed. The digital group had a significantly shorter drainage duration (mean difference = 1.5 days, 95% CI 0.8 to 2.2; p = 0.001). Adverse events were reported in 3% of the digital group and 1% of the analogue group, with mild severity.\n\nInterpretation: Digital drainage systems reduced drainage duration compared to analogue systems, suggesting a potential benefit in postoperative care. Further research is needed to confirm these findings and explore patient-specific strategies.\n\nTrial registration: NCT12345678\n\nFunding: This trial was funded by the National Institutes of Health.",
