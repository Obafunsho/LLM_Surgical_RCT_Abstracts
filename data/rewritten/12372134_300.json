A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of AI-Enhanced VR Training in Vascular Surgery\n\nBackground: The shift from open to endovascular techniques in vascular surgery has decreased trainee exposure to open procedures. This study assesses AI-enhanced VR training as a potential solution.\n\nMethods: This randomised controlled trial was conducted at a tertiary vascular surgery training center. Eligible participants were vascular surgery trainees. The intervention group received AI-enhanced VR training, while the control group underwent traditional training. The primary outcome was technical skill proficiency, measured over a 6-month period. Randomisation was computer-generated, with allocation concealment via sealed envelopes. Outcome assessors were blinded to group allocation.\n\nResults: A total of 200 participants were randomised: 100 to the intervention and 100 to the control group, between January 2020 and June 2021. Analysis included 98 in the intervention group and 97 in the control group, using an intention-to-treat approach. The intervention group demonstrated a significant improvement in technical skills (mean difference = 5.2, 95% CI 3.1 to 7.3; p = 0.01). Adverse events were mild, with 3% in the intervention group and 1% in the control group experiencing minor side effects.\n\nInterpretation: AI-enhanced VR training significantly enhances technical skills in vascular surgery trainees compared to traditional methods. The integration of these technologies into training curricula should focus on ethical use, thorough validation, and alignment with cognitive learning frameworks. This approach may offer a safer and more effective pathway for training the next generation of vascular surgeons.\n\nTrial registration: NCT12345678\n\nFunding: Supported by the National Institute of Health.",
