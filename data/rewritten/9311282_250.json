This study evaluates the effect of different immunosuppressive regimens on vaccine response.\n\nMethods: In the OPTIMIZE trial, elderly KTRs (≥65 years) were randomised to receive either a standard regimen of calcineurin inhibitor (CNI), mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), and prednisolone, or a regimen with low-dose CNI, everolimus, and prednisolone. The primary outcome was seroconversion rate, measured after 2 and 3 COVID-19 mRNA vaccinations. The trial was conducted at the University Medical Center Groningen, with 32 participants analysed for humoral response and 15 for cellular response. Randomisation was open-label, and outcome assessors were not blinded.\n\nResults: Seroconversion rates were 13% and 38% in the MMF group after 2 and 3 vaccinations, respectively, compared to 56% (p = 0.009) and 100% (p = 0.006) in the everolimus group. IgG antibody levels were significantly higher in the everolimus group (p = 0.004 and p < 0.001). No significant differences were observed in cellular response. No adverse events were reported.\n\nInterpretation: An immunosuppressive regimen with everolimus and reduced CNI dose significantly improves humoral response to COVID-19 vaccination in elderly KTRs. Further research in larger cohorts is warranted.\n\nTrial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03797196\n\nFunding: Not specified.",
