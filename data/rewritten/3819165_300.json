A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Laser Range Scanner for Intraoperative Neurosurgical Navigation\n\nBackground: This study investigates a novel laser range scanner (LRS) methodology for generating textured cortical surface descriptions to enhance image-to-patient registration and cortical feature recognition during neurosurgery.\n\nMethods: A randomised controlled trial was conducted with eight patients undergoing neurosurgery at a single institution. Participants were eligible if they required neurosurgery for various clinical presentations. The intervention involved using an LRS to acquire intraoperative cortical surface descriptions, which were then registered with preoperative magnetic resonance tomograms. The primary outcome was the mean feature alignment error between LRS and magnetic resonance surfaces, measured intraoperatively. Randomisation and allocation concealment methods were not specified. Blinding was not applicable.\n\nResults: Successful textured LRS surface acquisition was achieved for all eight patients. The mean feature alignment error was 1.7 ± 0.8 mm, indicating accurate registration between intraoperative and preoperative data. No adverse events were reported during the study.\n\nInterpretation: The LRS methodology demonstrated effective registration of intraoperative and preoperative data, enhancing cortical feature recognition and potentially improving neurosurgical navigation. The results suggest that LRS scanning could be a valuable tool for measuring deformation during surgery and improving the fidelity of image-to-patient registration.\n\nTrial registration: Not provided.\n\nFunding: Not specified.",
