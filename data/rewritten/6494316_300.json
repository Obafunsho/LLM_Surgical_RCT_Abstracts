A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Augmented Reality Headset for Training in Acetabular Component Positioning\n\nBackground: Accurate implant orientation is essential in arthroplasty to reduce wear and increase stability. This study assesses the effectiveness of an augmented reality (AR) headset as a training tool for acetabular component positioning in simulated total hip arthroplasty (THA).\n\nMethods: A randomised controlled trial was conducted with 24 final-year medical students applying to surgery residency programs, with no prior arthroplasty experience. Participants were randomised into two groups: one trained using an AR headset with live holographic feedback, and the other received hands-on training from an expert hip arthroplasty surgeon. The primary outcome was the orientation error in degrees between planned and achieved orientations, measured over four weekly sessions. Randomisation was computer-generated, and allocation was concealed. Blinding was not applicable.\n\nResults: All 24 participants completed the study. The AR group had a mean orientation error of 6° ± 4°, while the surgeon group had 1° ± 1° (p < 0.001). Both groups showed significant improvement over the sessions, with no significant difference in final accuracy (mean difference 1.2°, 95% CI, -1.8 to 4.2°; p = 0.281). In post-training evaluations, 11 of 12 participants expressed willingness to use the AR platform for developing visuospatial skills, and 10 of 12 for procedure-specific rehearsals. No adverse events were reported.\n\nInterpretation: The AR headset provided comparable accuracy to expert training in acetabular component positioning. Participants found the AR platform valuable for developing visuospatial skills and procedure-specific rehearsals. The study supports the feasibility of AR as an adjunct to traditional training. Further research is needed to evaluate its application in other arthroplasty skills and real surgery.\n\nTrial registration: [Trial registration number]\n\nFunding: [Source of funding]",
