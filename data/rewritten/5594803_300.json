  "abstract": "Background: Proper head and neck positioning is crucial for optimal laryngeal visualization during direct laryngoscopy. This study compares the sniffing position (SP) with simple head extension to evaluate laryngoscopic view and intubation difficulty.\n\nMethods: This prospective, randomised controlled trial was conducted at a tertiary care hospital in northern India. Five hundred adult patients (ASA Physical Status I–III) scheduled for elective surgery under general anesthesia were randomised into two groups: SP (n=250) and simple head extension (n=250). The primary outcome was the Intubation Difficulty Scale (IDS) score, measured during intubation. Randomisation was computer-generated, and allocation was concealed. The anesthesiologist performing the intubation was not blinded.\n\nResults: The IDS score was significantly lower in the SP group compared to the simple head extension group (p=0.000), indicating easier intubation. Patients in the simple head extension group required more lifting force, external laryngeal manipulation, and alternate techniques. No significant difference was observed in Cormack grades between the groups. No adverse events were reported.\n\nInterpretation: The SP provides a distinct advantage for tracheal intubation, as evidenced by lower IDS scores. It should be considered the standard head position for intubation under general anesthesia.\n\nTrial registration: Not provided.\n\nFunding: None.\n\n---\n\nTitle: A Randomised Controlled Trial Comparing Sniffing Position and Simple Head Extension for Laryngoscopic Intubation\n\n---\n\nBackground: Optimal head and neck positioning is essential for effective laryngeal visualization during direct laryngoscopy. This study evaluates the effectiveness of the sniffing position (SP) versus simple head extension in improving laryngoscopic view and reducing intubation difficulty.\n\nMethods: Conducted at a tertiary care hospital in northern India, this prospective, randomised controlled trial included 500 adult patients (ASA Physical Status I–III) undergoing elective surgery under general anesthesia. Participants were randomised into SP (n=250) and simple head extension (n=250) groups. The primary outcome was the Intubation Difficulty Scale (IDS) score, assessed during intubation. Randomisation was computer-generated, with allocation concealment. The anesthesiologist performing the intubation was not blinded.\n\nResults: The SP group demonstrated significantly lower IDS scores compared to the simple head extension group (p=0.000), indicating easier intubation. Patients in the simple head extension group required more lifting force, external laryngeal manipulation, and alternate techniques. No significant difference was found in Cormack grades between the groups. No adverse events were reported.\n\nInterpretation: The SP offers a significant advantage for tracheal intubation, as reflected by lower IDS scores. It should be adopted as the standard head position for intubation under general anesthesia until further large-scale trials are conducted.\n\nTrial registration: Not provided.\n\nFunding: None.",
