This study evaluated the effect of remote ischaemic preconditioning (RIPC) on perioperative high-sensitive cardiac troponin T (hs-cTnT) and interleukin 6 (IL-6) concentrations.\n\nMethods: In this single-centre, double-blind, randomised controlled trial, adult patients scheduled for elective pancreatic surgery at St. Antonius Hospital, Nieuwegein, Netherlands, between March 2017 and February 2019 were randomised to RIPC or a sham procedure. The primary endpoint was the maximum postoperative hs-cTnT concentration within 48 hours. Secondary endpoints included postoperative myocardial injury (PMI), defined as an increase of hs-cTnT of at least 14 ng/l above baseline, maximum IL-6 concentration within 48 hours, and postoperative complications within 30 days. Randomisation was performed using a web-based system with allocation concealment, and both patients and outcome assessors were blinded.\n\nResults: Ninety-two patients were randomised (46 RIPC, 46 control), and 90 were analysed using an intention-to-treat approach. RIPC did not significantly reduce the maximum hs-cTnT concentration (12.6 ng/l RIPC, 16.6 ng/l controls, P = 0.225) or the incidence of PMI (13/45 RIPC, 18/45 controls, P = 0.375). Maximum IL-6 concentrations were 265 pg/ml in RIPC and 385 pg/ml in controls (P = 0.108). Postoperative complications occurred in 23 RIPC and 24 control patients. No RIPC-related adverse events were reported.\n\nTrial registration: Clinicaltrials.gov identifier NCT03460938.\n\nFunding: Biomarker analysis was funded by Roche Diagnostics, which had no role in the study design, conduct, or manuscript preparation.",
