Systematic genetic screening at diagnosis is recommended to facilitate early genetic therapy.\n\nMethods: This multicenter, prospective cohort study enrolled 1000 incident ALS patients from 22 ALS centers in France between April 2021 and April 2022. Participants met ALS diagnostic criteria and were followed for 12 months. Genetic analysis focused on SOD1 and C9orf72 genes. The primary outcome was the frequency of SOD1 variants and C9orf72 G4C2 repeats, assessed at baseline.\n\nResults: C9orf72 G4C2 repeats were found in 7.6% of patients, while SOD1 variants were present in 1.6%. Among SOD1 patients, 50% had sporadic ALS, and 51% of C9orf72 patients had sporadic ALS. Fifteen distinct SOD1 variants were identified. C9orf72 patients had a younger age at onset and faster disease progression compared to non-expanded C9orf72 patients. In the non-SOD1 non-C9orf72 group, patients with at least one C9orf72 copy with two G4C2 repeats had shorter disease duration. No adverse events related to genetic testing were reported.\n\nInterpretation: The study confirms the low frequency of SOD1 variants in the French ALS population and highlights the rapid disease progression in C9orf72 expansion carriers. These findings support systematic genetic screening at diagnosis to enable targeted therapies. The absence of adverse events suggests the safety of genetic testing in this context.\n\nTrial registration: NCT04819555\n\nFunding: Not specified.",
