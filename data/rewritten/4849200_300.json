We recruited 76 men scheduled for open retropubic radical prostatectomy, randomising them to receive either lidocaine 2% or saline 0.9%: a pre-operative 0.075 ml.kg−1 intravenous bolus, an intra-operative intravenous infusion at 0.075 ml.kg−1.h−1, and a 24-hour postoperative subcutaneous infusion at 0.075 ml.kg−1.h−1. The primary outcome was postoperative hospital stay. Randomisation was computer-generated, and allocation was concealed using sequentially numbered opaque envelopes. Blinding included participants, clinicians, and outcome assessors.\n\nResults: 75 participants were analysed (37 lidocaine, 38 saline) using an intention-to-treat approach. Lidocaine reduced the postoperative hospital stay by a mean (95% CI) of 1.3 (0.3–2.4) days, p = 0.017. Pain at rest during the first 24 postoperative hours was reduced by a mean (95% CI) of 1.8 (0.7–2.9) mm.h−1, p = 0.001. Morphine consumption was reduced by a mean (95% CI) of 13.9 (2.2–25.7) mg, p = 0.021. No significant differences in adverse events were reported between groups. Plasma lidocaine concentrations were within therapeutic ranges, and no correlation with morphine consumption was observed.\n\nInterpretation: Peri-operative lidocaine infusion significantly reduced postoperative pain, morphine consumption, and hospital stay. These findings suggest that subcutaneous lidocaine may be a viable alternative to intravenous infusion, warranting further investigation.\n\nTrial registration: [Trial registration number]\n\nFunding: [Source of funding]",
