This study aimed to assess the quality of life in patients undergoing revascularization treatment.\n\nMethods: This single-center study was conducted at the General and Vascular Surgery Outpatient Clinic and the Department of General and Vascular Surgery Clinic in Poznan, Poland. Participants included 122 patients aged 41 to 88 years with chronic lower limb ischemia, excluding those with previous lower limb amputation, lack of independence in movement, diabetes, acute ischemia, and stage IV disease. The Polish version of the Vascular Quality of Life Questionnaire (VascuQoL) was used. Phase I included all patients, Phase II included 88 patients qualified for revascularization, and Phase III assessed outcomes six months post-procedure. Randomisation and blinding details were not applicable as this was not a randomised trial.\n\nResults: The primary outcome was quality of life, measured using VascuQoL. Significant improvements were observed post-revascularization in all domains. Pain and limited physical activity were major issues. Age negatively impacted the \"symptoms\" subscale. Gender, marital status, education, and residence did not significantly affect outcomes.\n\nInterpretation: The study highlights the need for patient education on modifiable risk factors and a multidisciplinary approach to management. No adverse events were reported. The study was approved by the Clinical Research Department of the Poznan University of Medical Sciences (reference number 37/2021).
