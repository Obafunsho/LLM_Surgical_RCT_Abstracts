A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Antimicrobial Drapes in Primary Knee Arthroplasty\n\nBackground: Periprosthetic joint infection (PJI) remains a significant complication post-arthroplasty. This study evaluates the efficacy of antimicrobial drapes in reducing intraoperative microbial contamination during primary knee arthroplasty.\n\nMethods: This investigator-initiated, two-arm, non-blinded, multicenter, randomised controlled trial was conducted in five hospitals in Denmark. Participants were patients over 18 years undergoing primary knee arthroplasty, excluding those with iodine allergy, prior knee surgery, septic arthritis, recent antibiotics, or inability to consent. Randomisation was performed using a computer-generated sequence, with 1659 patients allocated to either the intervention (antimicrobial drape) or control group. The primary outcome was the proportion of contaminated patients, measured intraoperatively. Analysis was per-protocol.\n\nResults: Of 1659 randomised, 603 in the intervention and 584 in the control group were analysed. Contamination occurred in 10% of the intervention group versus 15% in the control group (odds ratio 0.61 [95% CI 0.43 to 0.87]; p = 0.005). No adverse events were reported.\n\nInterpretation: Antimicrobial drapes significantly reduced contamination risk, suggesting their potential in infection prevention. Further research is needed to assess their impact on infection rates.\n\nTrial registration: [Trial registration number]\n\nFunding: [Source of funding]",
