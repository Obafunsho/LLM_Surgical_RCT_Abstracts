A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Sumatriptan for Postoperative Recovery After Microvascular Decompression\n\nBackground: Microvascular decompression (MVD) surgery can result in postoperative headaches similar to migraines, impacting recovery. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of sumatriptan on postoperative recovery quality.\n\nMethods: This single-centre, double-blind, randomised controlled trial included 50 patients experiencing postoperative headaches after MVD. Participants were randomised to receive either a subcutaneous injection of sumatriptan (6 mg) or saline. The primary outcome was the Quality of Recovery-40 (QoR-40) score at 24 hours. Randomisation was computer-generated, and allocation was concealed using sealed envelopes. Both patients and outcome assessors were blinded.\n\nResults: Fifty patients were randomised: 25 to the sumatriptan group and 25 to the placebo group. The sumatriptan group had significantly higher QoR-40 scores (median 184; interquartile range 169–196) compared to the placebo group (133; 119–155; P <0.01). Headache scores were also significantly lower in the sumatriptan group at 4, 12, and 24 hours. No significant differences were observed in other secondary outcomes. Adverse events were mild and occurred in 3/25 (12%) of the sumatriptan group and 1/25 (4%) of the placebo group.\n\nInterpretation: Sumatriptan significantly improved postoperative recovery quality and reduced headache severity after MVD surgery. The mechanism may involve serotonin-mediated headache reduction and mood modulation. Trial registration: NCT01632657. Funding: Not specified.",
