A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial on Preoperative Preparation and Anesthesia for Trabeculectomy\n\nBackground: This study evaluates the impact of preoperative preparation and anesthesia choice on trabeculectomy outcomes.\n\nMethods: A randomised controlled trial was conducted with participants eligible for trabeculectomy. The study was set in a tertiary ophthalmic center. Participants were randomly assigned to receive either subconjunctival-intracameral anesthesia without sedation or a comparator anesthesia technique. The primary outcome was the success rate of trabeculectomy, measured over a 12-month period. Randomisation was performed using a computer-generated sequence, with allocation concealment ensured by sealed envelopes. Outcome assessors were blinded to group allocation.\n\nResults: A total of 200 participants were randomised: 100 to the intervention group and 100 to the control group, between January 2020 and June 2021. Analysis was conducted on 98 participants in the intervention group and 97 in the control group using an intention-to-treat approach. The intervention group showed a higher success rate (mean difference = 5.2%, 95% CI 3.1 to 7.3; p = 0.01). Adverse events were reported in 3/100 (3%) of the intervention group and 1/98 (1%) of the control group, with mild complications.\n\nTrial registration: NCT12345678\n\nFunding: This trial was funded by the National Eye Institute.",
