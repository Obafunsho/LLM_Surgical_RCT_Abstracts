A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial on the Effects of Neuromuscular Blocking Agents in Neurosurgical Procedures\n\nBackground: Neuromuscular blocking agents are used in anesthesia to manage intracranial pressure during neurosurgical procedures. This study aims to evaluate the effects of different muscle relaxants on intracranial pressure.\n\nMethods: This randomised controlled trial was conducted in a tertiary care hospital. Participants were adult patients undergoing neurosurgery, with eligibility criteria including age 18-65 and no history of neuromuscular disorders. Participants were randomly assigned to receive either succinylcholine or atracurium. Randomisation was computer-generated, and allocation was concealed using sealed envelopes. Blinding was applied to outcome assessors and patients.\n\nObjective: To compare the effects of succinylcholine and atracurium on intracranial pressure.\n\nOutcome: The primary outcome was the change in intracranial pressure measured intraoperatively.\n\nResults: A total of 200 participants were randomised, with 100 in each group. Analysis was conducted on 98 participants in the succinylcholine group and 97 in the atracurium group using an intention-to-treat approach. The mean difference in intracranial pressure was 2.5 mm Hg (95% CI 1.0 to 4.0; p = 0.03) favoring atracurium. Adverse events were reported in 5% of the succinylcholine group and 3% of the atracurium group, with no severe events.\n\nTrial registration: NCT12345678\n\nFunding: This study was funded by the National Institute of Health.",
