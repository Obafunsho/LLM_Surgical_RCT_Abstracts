A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Tobramycin-Impregnated Bone Cement in Total Knee Arthroplasty\n\nBackground: This randomised controlled trial assessed the effectiveness of tobramycin-impregnated bone cement in achieving therapeutic antibiotic levels in patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty (TKA).\n\nMethods: Conducted at a single center, 15 patients undergoing primary TKA were randomly assigned to either the intervention group (n=10) receiving tobramycin-impregnated bone cement or the control group (n=5) receiving standard intravenous tobramycin. Randomisation was performed using a blinded envelope method, and allocation was concealed. Serum and intraarticular tobramycin levels were measured at 6, 24, and 48 hours postoperatively using an immunoassay technique. The primary outcome was intraarticular tobramycin concentration. The analysis was conducted per-protocol.\n\nResults: The intervention group demonstrated significantly higher intraarticular tobramycin levels at 6 hours (median=31.8 μg/mL, p=0.002), 24 hours (median=17.1 μg/mL, p=0.002), and 48 hours (median=6.8 μg/mL, p=0.02) compared to the control group. Serum tobramycin levels in the intervention group were ≤0.3 μg/mL, significantly lower than the control group at all time points (p<0.001). No adverse events were reported in either group.\n\nInterpretation: Tobramycin-impregnated bone cement achieves supratherapeutic local antibiotic concentrations with minimal systemic absorption, offering a potential advantage over intravenous administration alone. The study supports its use in TKA to reduce infection risk. Further research is needed to confirm these findings and assess long-term outcomes.\n\nTrial registration: Not provided.\n\nFunding: Not disclosed.",
