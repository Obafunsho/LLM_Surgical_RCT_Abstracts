Participants undergoing surgery were included based on eligibility criteria, and the study was conducted in a hospital setting. Participants were randomised to receive either a high fraction of inspired oxygen or a low fraction. The primary outcome was the incidence of surgical site infection, measured within 30 days post-surgery. Randomisation was computer-generated, and allocation was concealed using sealed envelopes. Blinding was applied to outcome assessors, patients, and clinicians.\n\nResults: A total of 200 participants were randomised: 100 to the high oxygen group and 100 to the low oxygen group, between April 2018 and March 2022. Analysis included 98 participants in the high oxygen group and 97 in the low oxygen group, using an intention-to-treat approach. The high oxygen group showed a slight reduction in surgical site infection (risk ratio 0.91, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.05). Adverse events included increased atelectasis in the high oxygen group (risk ratio 1.47, 95% CI 1.20 to 1.79) and a slight increase in postoperative pulmonary complications (risk ratio 1.06, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.46). No significant differences were observed in mortality, nausea, vomiting, or length of hospital stay.\n\nInterpretation: High inspired oxygen may slightly reduce surgical site infections but increases atelectasis and possibly pulmonary complications. Evidence is insufficient to recommend routine use of high oxygen. Further trials are needed to establish conclusive evidence.\n\nTrial registration: PROSPERO CRD42021272361.\n\nFunding: National Institute for Health and Care Research (NIHR) Health Technology Assessment programme (NIHR award ref: NIHR132987).",
