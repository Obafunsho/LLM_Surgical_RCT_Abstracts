This study aimed to evaluate the safety of neoadjuvant 177 Lu-DOTATATE followed by surgery in high-risk NF-PanNETs.\n\nMethods: NEOLUPANET was a multicentre, open-label, single-arm phase II trial conducted at eight Italian institutions. Eligible participants were adults with sporadic, resectable or potentially resectable NF-PanNETs, positive 68 Ga-DOTA PET, and at least one high-risk feature. The primary endpoint was safety, assessed by postoperative morbidity and mortality within 90 days. Secondary endpoints included objective radiological response and quality of life. A sample size of 30 was calculated to test postoperative complication rates against predefined cut-offs.\n\nResults: From March 2020 to February 2023, 31 patients were enrolled, and 26 completed four cycles of 177 Lu-DOTATATE. Partial radiological response was observed in 18 patients, with stable disease in 13. No disease progression occurred. Among 29 patients who underwent surgery, 24 R0 and 4 R1 resections were performed; one tumour was unresectable due to vascular involvement. No postoperative deaths occurred, but complications were noted in 21 patients, with severe complications in seven. Quality of life remained stable post-treatment but decreased after surgery.\n\nInterpretation: Neoadjuvant 177 Lu-DOTATATE is safe and effective for high-risk NF-PanNETs.
