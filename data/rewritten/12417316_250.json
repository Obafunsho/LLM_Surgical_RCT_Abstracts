A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Carotid Endarterectomy and Carotid Artery Stenting on Dementia Risk in Asymptomatic Extracranial Carotid Artery Disease\n\nBackground: Asymptomatic extracranial carotid artery disease (aECAD) is linked to increased Alzheimer's disease (AD) and non-AD dementia risk. This study evaluates the impact of carotid endarterectomy (CEA) and carotid artery stenting (CAS) on dementia incidence.\n\nMethods: In this retrospective cohort study, 487,676 patients with aECAD were identified from United States-based insurance claims (2010–2022). Propensity score matching was used to balance demographic and comorbidity characteristics between patients undergoing CEA or CAS and those untreated. The primary outcome was the incidence of AD, measured over a mean follow-up of 8.34 years.\n\nResults: After matching, 37,317 patients underwent CEA or CAS. CEA was associated with a significantly lower AD risk (relative risk = 0.93; 95% confidence interval, 0.86–0.99; P = 0.04), whereas CAS was associated with a slight but non-significant increase in AD risk (relative risk = 1.05; 95% confidence interval, 0.88–1.26; P = 0.56). Similar trends were observed for non-AD dementia.\n\nInterpretation: CEA, but not CAS, may confer a protective effect against AD and non-AD dementia in patients with aECAD. No adverse events were reported. The study was not registered as a clinical trial. Funding sources were not disclosed.",
