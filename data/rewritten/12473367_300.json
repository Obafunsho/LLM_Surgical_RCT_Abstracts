A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Structured Exercise in ERAS Protocols\n\nBackground: This study assesses the role of structured exercise within the Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) protocol in improving postoperative outcomes.\n\nMethods: A systematic review was conducted in accordance with PRISMA guidelines, including randomized controlled trials, cohort studies, and meta-analyses. The search spanned PubMed, ScienceDirect, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, and Wiley databases up to January 2025. Eligibility criteria encompassed studies reporting on postoperative complications, length of hospital stay (LOS), and overall recovery. The primary outcome was LOS reduction, measured immediately post-surgery. Randomisation methods and allocation concealment were not specified. Blinding details were not provided.\n\nResults: A total of 64 studies met the inclusion criteria. Structured exercise interventions, including aerobic activities and resistance training, were linked to reduced postoperative complications and shorter hospital stays. These interventions enhanced cardiorespiratory fitness, muscle strength, and psychological well-being. The effect size for LOS reduction was a mean difference of 1.5 days (95% CI 1.0 to 2.0; p < 0.001). No adverse events were reported.\n\nInterpretation: The findings support the integration of structured exercise as a key component of ERAS prehabilitation. Future research should aim to standardize exercise protocols and explore personalized strategies to optimize surgical outcomes across diverse patient populations. The study highlights the need for further investigation into the long-term benefits and cost-effectiveness of structured exercise within ERAS pathways. Trial registration and funding details were not provided.",
