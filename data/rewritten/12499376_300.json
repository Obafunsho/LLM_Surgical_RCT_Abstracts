A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Long-term Outcomes of Invasive vs. Noninvasive Treatments for Intermittent Claudication: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Randomised Controlled Trials\n\nBackground: Intermittent claudication (IC) impairs mobility and quality of life. This study evaluates the long-term outcomes of invasive versus noninvasive treatments for IC.\n\nMethods: A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) was conducted. Databases searched included PubMed, MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, Embase, and Scopus. Participants were adults diagnosed with IC. Interventions included invasive treatments (angioplasty, revascularization) and noninvasive treatments (supervised exercise therapy, best medical therapy). The primary outcomes were quality of life (QoL), ankle-brachial pressure index (ABPI), and maximum walking distance (MWD) over 2 to 7 years. Randomisation and allocation concealment methods were not specified. Blinding details were not provided. A total of 1379 patients from 11 RCTs were included.\n\nResults: Invasive treatments significantly improved MWD (pooled MD = 64.94, 95% CI [10.77, 115.12], p = .02) and ABPI (pooled MD = 0.15, 95% CI [0.04, 0.26], p = .006). However, they were associated with a higher rate of complications, including increased amputation risk (pooled OR = 2.46, 95% CI [0.44, 13.94], p = .31). Noninvasive treatments had higher long-term re-intervention rates (pooled OR = 0.56, 95% CI [0.33, 0.97], p = .04). Adverse events were more frequent in the invasive group, though not statistically significant.\n\nInterpretation: Both invasive and noninvasive treatments are effective for managing IC. Invasive treatments provide greater improvements in blood flow and walking distance but carry higher risks of complications. Noninvasive treatments, while safer, may require re-intervention in the long term. Further research with larger sample sizes and long-term assessment is needed to evaluate cost-effectiveness and outcomes. Trial registration: PROSPERO CRD42023494962. Funding: Not specified.",
