Randomisation occurred after each center achieved 85% accuracy in SN identification during a 30-case learning phase. The primary outcome was the accuracy of LM/SNB, assessed by SN identification rates and nodal metastases incidence, over a recruitment period ending March 31, 2002, with 2001 patients enrolled. Blinding details were not specified.\n\nResults: The overall SN identification rate was 95.3%, with specific rates of 99.3% for the groin, 95.3% for the axilla, and 84.5% for the neck basins. False-negative LM/SNB rates decreased with increasing case volume: 10.3% for the first 25 cases versus 5.2% after 25 cases. Complication rates were 10.1% for LM/SNB, increasing to 37.2% with CLND. No operative mortalities were reported.\n\nInterpretation: LM/SNB is a safe, low-morbidity procedure for staging regional nodal basins in early melanoma. Its accuracy improves with experience, supporting its adoption as standard care. Trial registration and funding details were not provided.",
