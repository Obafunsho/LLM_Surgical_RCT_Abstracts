A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial on Biologic Mesh Remodeling in Abdominal Tissue Repair\n\nBackground: This study aimed to evaluate the associations between patient characteristics or surgical site classifications and the histologic remodeling scores of biologic meshes used in abdominal soft tissue repair.\n\nMethods: In this randomised controlled trial, biologic meshes were biopsied from the abdominal tissue repair sites of 40 patients during an abdominal re-exploration. The study was conducted at a tertiary care center. Eligibility criteria included patients undergoing abdominal re-exploration with prior biologic mesh implantation. Biopsies were stained with hematoxylin and eosin and evaluated using a semi-quantitative scoring system for remodeling characteristics. The primary outcome was the composite remodeling score (CR), measured at the time of re-exploration. Randomisation was performed using a computer-generated sequence, and allocation was concealed using sealed envelopes. Outcome assessors were blinded to patient allocation.\n\nResults: The model selection process for the cell infiltration (CI) score yielded two variables: age at mesh implantation and mesh classification (c-statistic=0.989). For the CR score, the model selection process yielded two variables: age at mesh implantation and mesh classification (r²=0.449). No adverse events were reported.\n\nInterpretation: These preliminary results are the first steps in generating a risk prediction model for non-constructive remodeling of abdominal tissue repair sites with biologic mesh reinforcement.
