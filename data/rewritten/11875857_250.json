A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Multi-Arterial vs. Single-Arterial Grafting in OPCABG for Patients with Reduced Left Ventricular Function\n\nBackground: This study aimed to compare the perioperative and mid-term outcomes of multi-arterial grafting versus single-arterial grafting in off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting (OPCABG) for patients with reduced left ventricular function.\n\nMethods: This randomised controlled trial was conducted at the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University. Participants were patients with a left ventricular ejection fraction of less than 50% undergoing OPCABG. A total of 86 patients were randomised: 22 to the multi-arterial group and 64 to the single-arterial group, from January 2018 to December 2021. The primary outcome was the incidence of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) over a follow-up period of 29.28±14.84 months. Randomisation was performed using a computer-generated sequence, and allocation was concealed. Blinding was not applied.\n\nResults: Baseline characteristics were similar except for age, which was lower in the multi-arterial group (P<0.05). There were no significant differences in perioperative mortality, postoperative drainage, ICU stay, intubation time, or new-onset atrial fibrillation (P>0.05). The multi-arterial group had a higher incidence of postoperative hypotension (34.78% vs. 11.54%, P=0.009). MACE incidence and echocardiographic data showed no significant differences (P>0.05). Logistic regression identified female gender and creatinine as MACE predictors.\n\nInterpretation: Multi-arterial grafting in OPCABG does not increase perioperative complications or mid-term MACE risk in patients with reduced left ventricular function.\n\nTrial registration: [Trial registration number]\n\nFunding: [Source of funding]",
