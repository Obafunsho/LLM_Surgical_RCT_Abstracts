A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Glutamine-Supplemented Parenteral Nutrition in Surgical ICU Patients\n\nBackground: Glutamine (GLN) requirements may increase with critical illness, and GLN-supplemented parenteral nutrition (PN) may improve clinical outcomes in surgical ICU (SICU) patients. This study aimed to determine the effect of GLN-supplemented PN on clinical outcomes in SICU patients.\n\nMethods: This parallel-group, multicenter, double-blind, randomized controlled trial included adults post-gastrointestinal, vascular, or cardiac surgery requiring PN and SICU care. Participants without significant renal or hepatic failure or shock were randomized to receive either standard GLN-free PN (STD-PN) or PN containing alanyl-GLN dipeptide (GLN-PN). The primary endpoints were hospital mortality and infections. Randomization was computer-generated, and allocation was concealed. Blinding included patients, clinicians, and outcome assessors. A total of 150 participants were randomized, 75 to each group, and analyzed using an intention-to-treat approach.\n\nResults: Hospital mortality was 14.7% in the GLN-PN group and 17.3% in the STD-PN group (difference, −2.6%; 95% CI −14.6 to 9.3%; P = 0.66). The 6-month cumulative all-cause mortality was 31.4% in the GLN-PN group and 29.7% in the STD-PN group (P = 0.88). Incident bloodstream infection rates were 9.6 and 8.4 per 1000 hospital days in the GLN-PN and STD-PN groups, respectively (P = 0.73). Adverse events were similar between groups.\n\nInterpretation: GLN-supplemented PN was safe but did not significantly alter clinical outcomes in SICU patients.
