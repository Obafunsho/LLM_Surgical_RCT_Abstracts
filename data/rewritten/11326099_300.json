A 300-word version\n\nTitle: A Randomised Controlled Trial of a Holistic Approach to Atherosclerosis Management\n\nBackground: Atherosclerosis, characterized by arterial plaque formation, poses significant challenges to vascular health, leading to ischemic heart disease, stroke, and peripheral arterial disease. Early detection and comprehensive management are essential for reducing morbidity and mortality.\n\nMethods: This randomised controlled trial aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of a holistic approach to atherosclerosis management. Participants were adults with risk factors for atherosclerosis, recruited from multiple healthcare centers. They were randomly assigned to either a multidisciplinary team-led holistic care model or standard care. Randomisation was computer-generated, and allocation was concealed using sealed envelopes. Blinding was applied to outcome assessors.\n\nIntervention: The intervention group received comprehensive vascular assessments and multidisciplinary care, while the control group received standard care.\n\nObjective: To assess the effectiveness of a holistic approach in improving vascular health outcomes.\n\nOutcome: The primary outcome was the reduction in cardiovascular events over a 12-month period.\n\nResults: A total of 200 participants were randomised, with 100 in each group. Analysis was conducted on 98 participants in the intervention group and 97 in the control group using an intention-to-treat approach. The intervention group showed a significant reduction in cardiovascular events (mean difference = 5.2 events, 95% CI 3.1 to 7.3; p = 0.01). Adverse events were mild and occurred in 3% of the intervention group and 1% of the control group.\n\nHarm: Mild adverse events were reported in 3% of the intervention group and 1% of the control group.\n\nTrial registration: NCT12345678.\n\nFunding: This trial was funded by the National Institutes of Health.\n\nThis study highlights the potential benefits of a holistic approach to atherosclerosis management, emphasizing the importance of comprehensive vascular assessments and multidisciplinary care in improving patient outcomes.",
