A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Prophylactic Fibrinogen Administration in Paediatric Scoliosis Surgery\n\nBackground: Scoliosis surgery in children often involves significant blood loss. This study evaluates the safety and feasibility of prophylactic fibrinogen administration in paediatric scoliosis surgery.\n\nMethods: This two-arm, single-centre, randomised, double-blind trial was conducted at a tertiary care hospital in the Czech Republic. Thirty-two children undergoing elective scoliosis surgery were randomised 1:1 to receive either standard blood and coagulation management or a single prophylactic dose of fibrinogen concentrate. The primary outcome was safety, assessed by adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs) during the hospital stay. Randomisation was computer-generated with allocation concealment via a web-based system. Blinding included patients, clinicians, and outcome assessors.\n\nResults: Between June 2022 and June 2023, 32 participants were randomised, with 16 in each group. All were analysed using an intention-to-treat approach. In the fibrinogen group, 101 AEs across 19 types were observed, while the standard group had 95 AEs across 21 types (p>0.9999). One SAE occurred in the standard group. No significant difference in blood loss was found between groups (p=0.1677). No deaths or AEs of special interest were reported.\n\nInterpretation: Prophylactic fibrinogen administration in paediatric scoliosis surgery appears safe and feasible. However, due to the limited sample size, efficacy conclusions cannot be drawn. These findings will inform future trial designs.\n\nTrial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT05391412.\n\nFunding: Not specified.",
