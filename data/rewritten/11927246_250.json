A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Transcutaneous Electrical Acupoint Stimulation for PONV Prevention in Gynecological Laparoscopy\n\nBackground: Postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) is prevalent in gynecological laparoscopy. This study evaluates the efficacy of single-period versus multiple-period transcutaneous electrical acupoint stimulation (TEAS) for PONV prevention.\n\nMethods: This prospective, randomized, double-blind trial was conducted at an academic medical center specializing in women's and children's care. A total of 120 women, aged 18-65, undergoing gynecological laparoscopy were randomized into three groups: single-period TEAS (Group S, n=40), multiple-period TEAS (Group M, n=40), and non-stimulation control (Group C, n=40). Randomization was computer-generated with allocation concealment using sealed envelopes. Blinding included patients and outcome assessors. The primary outcome was PONV incidence and severity within 48 hours post-surgery.\n\nResults: Group M showed significantly reduced PONV incidence compared to Group C (10% vs. 50%, p<0.05) and Group S (10% vs. 17.5%, p<0.05). Group M also had lower pain scores and reduced rescue antiemetic use. No adverse events related to TEAS were reported.\n\nInterpretation: Multiple-period TEAS is more effective than single-period TEAS in reducing PONV and postoperative pain in gynecological laparoscopy. This approach could enhance multimodal prophylactic antiemetic regimens.\n\nTrial registration: Chinese Clinical Trials Registry, No. ChiCTR2200065802.\n\nFunding: Not specified.",
