A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Neoadjuvant PD-1 Blockade Plus Chemoradiotherapy in Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma\n\nBackground: This study aimed to assess the impact of neoadjuvant PD-1 blockade plus chemoradiotherapy on pathological response (PR) and survival in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC).\n\nMethods: Conducted at Nanjing Drum Tower Hospital, China, this retrospective cohort study included PDAC patients undergoing resection after neoadjuvant treatment (NAT). Participants were divided into a combined group receiving PD-1 blockade plus chemoradiotherapy and a non-combined group receiving PD-1 blockade plus chemotherapy. The primary outcome was complete pathological response (CPR), assessed using the CAP and MDACC systems. The study period spanned from April 2019 to December 2023.\n\nResults: A total of 47 patients were enrolled, with 26 in the combined group and 21 in the non-combined group. CPR was achieved in 6 patients (23.1%) in the combined group and none in the non-combined group. Age and tumor size decrease were independently associated with PR (p < 0.05). The 2-year overall survival (OS) rate, median OS, and median disease-free survival (DFS) were higher in the combined group, with OS rates of 75.2% versus 42.6% and median OS of 30.5 versus 23.3 months. Significant prognostic factors for OS included portal vein/superior mesenteric vein invasion (p = 0.034), resectability status (p = 0.019), and preoperative CA19-9 levels (p = 0.002). Preoperative CA19-9 levels were also an independent prognostic factor for DFS (p = 0.001).\n\nInterpretation: Neoadjuvant PD-1 blockade plus chemoradiotherapy was associated with a higher CPR rate in resected PDAC. Age and tumor size decrease were predictive factors for PR. The study was not registered, and funding details were not provided. Further research is needed to confirm these findings in larger, prospective trials.",
