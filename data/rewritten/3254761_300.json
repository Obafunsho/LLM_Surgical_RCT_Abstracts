A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Ceramic-on-Ceramic vs. Metal-on-Polyethylene Bearings in Total Hip Arthroplasty\n\nBackground: This study investigates the long-term outcomes of ceramic-on-ceramic bearings compared to metal-on-polyethylene bearings in total hip arthroplasty, focusing on survivorship and osteolysis.\n\nMethods: A multicenter randomised controlled trial was conducted involving 189 patients (216 hips) who were randomised to receive either alumina ceramic bearings (144 hips) or cobalt chrome-on-polyethylene bearings (72 hips). The study was performed at five sites by five surgeons. Eligibility criteria included patients undergoing total hip arthroplasty. The primary outcome was the survivorship of the bearing surface and implant systems over a minimum of 10 years, with an average follow-up of 10.3 years. Randomisation was achieved using a computer-generated sequence, and allocation was concealed. Blinding details were not specified.\n\nResults: Kaplan-Meier survivorship analysis revealed no significant difference in bearing-related failures between the ceramic (99.1%) and control groups (98.9%). Revisions for any reason were significantly lower in the ceramic group (3.1%) compared to the control group (10.5%). Osteolysis was present in 26% of the control group and absent in the ceramic group. Squeaking was reported in 1.4% of the ceramic group. All femoral implants remained well fixed, with one acetabular component unstable in the control group.\n\nInterpretation: The ceramic-on-ceramic bearings showed superior outcomes in terms of revision rates and osteolysis compared to metal-on-polyethylene bearings at 10 years. These results suggest that ceramic bearings are a viable option for younger, more active patients. Trial registration and funding information were not provided. Further research is needed to compare ceramic bearings with other new alternative bearings.",
