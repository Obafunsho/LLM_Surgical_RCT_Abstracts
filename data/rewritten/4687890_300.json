A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Mitral Valve Repair vs. Replacement for Severe Ischemic Mitral Regurgitation\n\nBackground: The Cardiothoracic Surgical Trials Network conducted a randomised controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy of mitral valve repair versus replacement in patients with severe ischemic mitral regurgitation, with a primary focus on the left ventricular end-systolic volume index at 1 year post-surgery.\n\nMethods: A total of 251 patients were randomised to either repair (n = 126) or replacement (n = 125) across multiple cardiothoracic centers. Eligibility criteria included severe ischemic mitral regurgitation. Randomisation was computer-generated, with allocation concealment ensured. Due to the nature of the interventions, blinding was not feasible. The primary outcome was the recurrence of moderate/severe mitral regurgitation or death within 2 years. Logistic regression was used to estimate recurrence or death probability from baseline factors, and receiver operating characteristic curves determined classification cut-points.\n\nResults: Among the 116 patients who received repair, 76 experienced moderate/severe mitral regurgitation or died. The model, which included factors such as age, body mass index, sex, race, effective regurgitant orifice area, and history of coronary interventions, demonstrated an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.82. The mechanism for recurrent mitral regurgitation was primarily mitral valve leaflet tethering. Adverse events were not detailed in the abstract.\n\nInterpretation: The model showed good discrimination in predicting patients at risk of recurrence or death post-repair, suggesting a clinically relevant risk score for surgical candidate selection. Validation in further studies is necessary.\n\nTrial registration: [Trial registration number]\n\nFunding: [Source of funding]",
