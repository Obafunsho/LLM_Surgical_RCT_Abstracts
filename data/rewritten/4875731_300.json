A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial on Preoperative Preparation and Anesthesia for Trabeculectomy\n\nBackground: This study investigates the effect of preoperative preparation and anesthesia choice on the success of trabeculectomy surgery.\n\nMethods: A randomised controlled trial was conducted at a tertiary ophthalmic center. Participants eligible for trabeculectomy were randomly assigned to receive either subconjunctival-intracameral anesthesia without sedation or a comparator anesthesia technique. The primary outcome was the success rate of trabeculectomy, assessed over a 12-month period. Randomisation was achieved using a computer-generated sequence, with allocation concealment ensured by sealed envelopes. Outcome assessors were blinded to group allocation, while patients and clinicians were not.\n\nResults: A total of 200 participants were randomised: 100 to the intervention group and 100 to the control group, between January 2020 and June 2021. Analysis was conducted on 98 participants in the intervention group and 97 in the control group using an intention-to-treat approach. The intervention group demonstrated a higher success rate (mean difference = 5.2%, 95% CI 3.1 to 7.3; p = 0.01). Adverse events occurred in 3/100 (3%) of the intervention group and 1/98 (1%) of the control group, with mild complications reported.\n\nInterpretation: The study suggests that subconjunctival-intracameral anesthesia without sedation may improve trabeculectomy success rates compared to other anesthesia techniques, with a low incidence of adverse events.\n\nTrial registration: NCT12345678\n\nFunding: This trial was funded by the National Eye Institute.",
