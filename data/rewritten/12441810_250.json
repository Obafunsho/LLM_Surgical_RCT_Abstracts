A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial Comparing Proximal Gastrectomy with Double-Tract Reconstruction to Total Gastrectomy in Early-Stage Proximal Gastric Cancer\n\nBackground: Total gastrectomy (TG) is commonly used for proximal gastric cancer but often results in nutritional and metabolic disorders. This study compares proximal gastrectomy with double-tract reconstruction (PG-DTR) to TG with Roux-en-Y reconstruction (TG-RY) in early-stage proximal gastric cancer.\n\nMethods: This randomised controlled trial enrolled patients with cT1 to cT2 proximal gastric cancer at Fujian Cancer Hospital. Participants were randomised to PG-DTR or TG-RY. The primary outcome was postoperative nutritional status at 3 months, assessed by body weight, hemoglobin, and albumin levels. Secondary outcomes included surgical outcomes, reflux esophagitis, and quality of life (QOL) measured at 3, 6, and 12 months using the PGSAS-45. Randomisation was computer-generated, with allocation concealed. Blinding was not applied.\n\nResults: 186 patients were randomised: 93 to PG-DTR and 93 to TG-RY. Analysis was per-protocol. PG-DTR showed improved nutritional status at 3 months (mean difference in hemoglobin = 1.2 g/dL, 95% CI 0.8 to 1.6; p < 0.01). No significant differences were found in surgical outcomes, reflux esophagitis, or QOL. Adverse events were similar between groups.\n\nTrial registration: Not provided.\n\nFunding: Supported by institutional funding.",
