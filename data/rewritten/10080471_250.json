A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Transcutaneous Auricular Nerve Stimulation for Pain Reduction After Orthopaedic Trauma Surgery\n\nBackground: This study evaluated whether transcutaneous auricular nerve stimulation (TAN) reduces pain after orthopaedic trauma surgery through autonomic modulation.\n\nMethods: In a randomised controlled trial, 86 participants aged over 18 years undergoing orthopaedic trauma surgery were randomly assigned to receive either active or sham bilateral TAN. The intervention was administered for 50 minutes before and 24 hours after surgery. The primary outcome was the absolute change in pain 24 hours postoperatively, measured using a 100 mm visual analogue scale (VAS). Randomisation was computer-generated, and allocation was concealed. Outcome assessors were blinded to group allocation.\n\nResults: Between June 22, 2021, and July 7, 2022, 79 participants completed the study. The mean reduction in VAS was 19 mm (95% CI: 12–26) in the active TAN group (n=40) compared to 10 mm (95% CI: 3–17) in the sham group (n=39; P=0.023). A minimally clinically important reduction in pain occurred in 78% of the active TAN group versus 38% in the sham group (odds ratio 5.51, 95% CI: 2.06–14.73; P=0.001). Active TAN increased heart rate variability. Adverse events included auricular skin irritation in six participants in the active group and two in the sham group.\n\nInterpretation: Bilateral TAN effectively reduces perioperative pain through autonomic modulation, offering a non-pharmacological approach to improve perioperative analgesia.\n\nTrial registration: [Trial registration number]\n\nFunding: [Source of funding]",
