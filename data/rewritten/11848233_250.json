A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Plasma Expansion on Renal Perfusion in Critically Ill COVID-19 Patients\n\nBackground: This study aimed to evaluate the effects of plasma expansion with a standardized fluid bolus on renal perfusion in critically ill COVID-19 patients with and without acute kidney injury (AKI).\n\nMethods: This case-control study was conducted at Uppsala University Hospital, Sweden. Participants were ICU-treated COVID-19 patients without underlying kidney disease, assigned to AKI or NO AKI groups based on KDIGO Creatinine criteria. Renal perfusion was assessed using magnetic resonance imaging before and after plasma expansion with 7.5 mL/kg Ringer's Acetate. The primary outcome was the change in renal perfusion, measured immediately post-intervention. A mixed model repeated measures ANOVA was used for analysis.\n\nResults: Seventeen patients were enrolled between June 4, 2020, and May 10, 2021, with nine in the AKI group and eight in the NO AKI group. Plasma expansion increased mean arterial pressure by 9 mmHg (95% CI 0.5–18) in the AKI group and 15 mmHg (95% CI 5–24) in the NO AKI group. Total renal and cortical perfusion did not significantly change in either group. Medullary perfusion decreased in the NO AKI group from 55 to 34 mL/min/100 g (p = 0.0027). No adverse events were reported.\n\nInterpretation: Plasma expansion did not enhance renal perfusion in critically ill COVID-19 patients, regardless of AKI status. Trial registration: ClinicalTrials ID: NCT02765191. Funding: Supported by Uppsala University Hospital and other grants.",
