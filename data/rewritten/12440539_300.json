A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Retrospective Observational Cohort Study on Fluid Responsiveness in Pediatric Intensive Care\n\nBackground: Cardiac mechanical efficiency, measured by dynamic arterial elastance (Ea dyn), is a predictor of fluid responsiveness (FR) in adults. This study assesses the association between Ea dyn and mean arterial pressure (MAP) after fluid bolus in children with MAP ≤50th percentile for age.\n\nMethods: This retrospective observational cohort study analyzed IV crystalloid fluid boluses ≥10 mL/kg given to patients ≤18 years old within the first 72 hours of admission to a PICU. Ea dyn was calculated in 10-second intervals during the 20 minutes pre-bolus. FR was defined as an increase of ≥10% in MAP from pre-bolus to the average MAP over 20 minutes post-bolus. The Kruskal-Wallis test assessed associations.\n\nResults: We analyzed 490 fluid boluses given to children with MAP ≤50th percentile for age across 365 PICU encounters. Pre-bolus Ea dyn was not associated with FR (p > 0.1). This lack of association persisted in subgroup analysis among those mechanically ventilated or on vasoactive medication, and in stratification by MAP percentile for age and duration of time in MAP percentile. Mechanical efficiency was high (Ea dyn > 0.7) for most children, even in the lowest MAP percentile for age cohorts. The study found no adverse events related to the fluid boluses.\n\nInterpretation: Pre-bolus Ea dyn is not associated with FR in critically ill children. The findings suggest that Ea dyn may not be a useful tool for predicting fluid responsiveness in pediatric patients. Further research is needed to understand the changing cardiac physiology of children as blood pressure decreases to develop more targeted, age-based shock management strategies. The study was conducted at an academic PICU, and no trial registration or specific funding source was reported.",
