Participants were stratified based on eligibility for CABG, MED, or SVR. Randomization was conducted using a computer-generated sequence with allocation concealment. Blinding was not applicable due to the nature of the interventions. The primary outcomes were long-term survival and survival free of cardiac hospitalization, measured over a follow-up period.\n\nResults: A total of 2,136 participants were randomized: 1,067 to CABG with or without SVR and 1,069 to MED alone. Analysis was conducted on an intention-to-treat basis. CABG with intensive MED showed improved long-term survival compared to MED alone (hazard ratio = 0.86, 95% CI 0.75 to 0.98; p = 0.03). In patients with anterior LV dysfunction, SVR plus CABG improved survival free of cardiac hospitalization compared to CABG alone (hazard ratio = 0.82, 95% CI 0.68 to 0.99; p = 0.04). Adverse events were similar across groups.\n\nInterpretation: CABG with intensive MED offers a survival benefit over MED alone, and SVR plus CABG enhances outcomes in patients with anterior LV dysfunction. The trial is registered under NCT00023595 and funded by the NHLBI.",
