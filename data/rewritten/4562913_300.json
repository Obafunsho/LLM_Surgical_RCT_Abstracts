  "abstract": "300-word version:\n\nBackground: This study aimed to assess the effectiveness of joint-preserving tumor resection for juxtaarticular osteosarcoma after microwave ablation of the tumor edge under navigation, hypothesizing that this approach could prevent local recurrences while preserving joint function.\n\nMethods: Conducted as a prospective cohort study from 2009 to 2011, 11 patients with juxtaarticular osteosarcoma of the proximal tibia (mean age, 12 years; range, 9–16 years) were included. Eligibility criteria were a tumor edge to articular surface distance of 10 to 15 mm, good chemotherapy response, absence of pathologic fracture, and no major neurovascular involvement. The intervention involved transepiphysis tumor resection with navigation-assisted microwave ablation, followed by reconstruction using allograft and a vascularized fibula flap. Patients were followed for a minimum of 37 months (mean, 48 months; range 37–62 months). The primary outcome was local tumor control, assessed over the follow-up period. \n\nResults: No local recurrences were observed. Major complications included osteonecrosis of part of the epiphysis in two patients and deep infection in one. Functional outcomes, measured by the Musculoskeletal Tumor Society score, ranged from 26 to 30, with a mean of 29. \n\nInterpretation: The findings suggest that navigated resection with adjuvant microwave ablation provides adequate local tumor control in selected patients, enabling joint-sparing surgery. Although the results are promising, further research with larger sample sizes and extended follow-up is necessary to validate these outcomes. \n\nTrial registration: Not applicable. \n\nFunding: Not specified.",
