A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Infrapatellar Fat Pad Excision in Minimally Invasive Total Knee Arthroplasty: A Randomised Controlled Trial\n\nBackground: The effect of infrapatellar fat pad excision during minimally invasive total knee arthroplasty (MIS TKA) on patella baja, anterior knee pain, and function is debated.\n\nMethods: This randomised controlled trial was conducted at a single institution, involving 90 patients undergoing MIS TKA. Participants were randomised into two groups: 45 patients with complete infrapatellar fat pad excision and 45 without. Randomisation was achieved using a computer-generated sequence with allocation concealment. The primary outcome was anterior knee pain, assessed at 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, and 1 year postoperatively. Secondary outcomes included patellar tendon shortening, Knee Society Score (KSS), functional subscore, and patellar complications. Outcome assessors were blinded to group allocation.\n\nResults: At the final follow-up, no significant differences were found in patellar tendon shortening, KSS, functional subscore, or knee flexion between the groups. However, the excision group experienced more anterior knee pain (8.3% versus 0%; p = 0.03; 95% CI, −0.007 to 0.174). No patellar complications were observed in either group. Complete follow-up data were available for 77 of 90 patients (86%). The analysis was conducted on an intention-to-treat basis.\n\nInterpretation: Infrapatellar fat pad excision in MIS TKA is linked to increased anterior knee pain. Surgeons should preserve the fat pad if sufficient exposure can be achieved without excision.\n\nTrial registration: [Trial registration number]\n\nFunding: [Source of funding]",
