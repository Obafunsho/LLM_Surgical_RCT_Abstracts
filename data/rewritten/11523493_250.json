A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Reinforced Tension-Line Suture in Colorectal Cancer Surgery\n\nBackground: This study aimed to evaluate whether adding a reinforced tension-line (RTL) suture to the standard 4:1 small-bite closure reduces incisional hernia incidence after colorectal cancer surgery.\n\nMethods: This open parallel randomised controlled trial was conducted at two Swedish hospitals from 2017 to 2021. Patients aged 18 years or older, scheduled for elective colorectal cancer surgery through a midline incision, were randomised in a 1:1 ratio to either RTL and 4:1 small-bite closure with polypropylene sutures (RTL group) or 4:1 small-bite closure with polydioxanone suture alone (PDS group). The primary outcome was CT-detected incisional hernia at 1 year. Randomisation was stratified by study centre, and allocation was concealed using sequentially numbered sealed opaque envelopes. CT interpreters were blinded to treatment groups.\n\nResults: A total of 160 patients were randomised, 80 in each group. At 1 year, 134 patients were analysed: 63 in the RTL group and 71 in the PDS group, using an intention-to-treat approach. Incisional hernia was found in 4 (6%) patients in the RTL group and 15 (21%) in the PDS group (OR 3.95, 95% CI 1.24 to 12.60; P = 0.014). No unintended effects were reported in either group.\n\nInterpretation: Adding an RTL suture at fascial closure significantly reduced the incidence of incisional hernia in colorectal cancer surgery.
