A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial on Timing of Surgery Post-Chemoradiotherapy in Locally Advanced Rectal Cancer\n\nBackground: The optimal timing of surgery following chemoradiotherapy (CRT) for locally advanced rectal adenocarcinoma (LARC) remains controversial. This trial aimed to compare disease recurrence and survival rates between patients undergoing total mesorectal excision (TME) after a waiting interval of 8 weeks or less (classic interval; CI) versus more than 8 weeks (long interval; LI) following preoperative CRT.\n\nMethods: This phase III, single-centre, randomised clinical trial was conducted at Ege University Faculty of Medicine Hospital, Izmir, Turkey. Patients with LARC within 12 cm of the anal verge (T3–T4 or N+ disease) were randomised using an adaptive biased coin technique to undergo TME within or after 8 weeks post-CRT. The primary outcome was pathological complete response (pCR) rate, measured at the time of surgery.\n\nResults: Between January 2006 and January 2017, 350 patients were randomised (175 to each group). Of these, 322 were analysed (CI, 159; LI, 163) using an intention-to-treat approach. The cumulative incidence of locoregional recurrence at 5 years was 10.1% in the CI group and 6.9% in the LI group (P = 0.143). The cumulative incidence of distant metastasis at 5 years was 30.8% in the CI group and 18.6% in the LI group (sub-HR = 1.78; 95% CI 1.14 to 2.78, P = 0.010). No significant differences in disease-free survival (DFS) or overall survival (OS) were observed.\n\nTrial registration: NCT03287843.\n\nFunding: Not specified.",
