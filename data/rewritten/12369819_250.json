Participants were identified from the SWEDEHEART registry. The primary outcome was the incidence of all-cause mortality, stroke, new myocardial infarction, new coronary angiography, and new revascularization, measured over a median follow-up of 3.6 years. The study was observational, and no randomisation or blinding was performed.\n\nResults: Of the total cohort, 2,869 patients (15.8%) underwent preoperative flow assessment. Patients with flow assessment were younger and had a lower EuroSCORE II. There were no significant differences in mortality, post-discharge myocardial infarction, or stroke between groups. However, preoperative flow assessment was associated with a higher risk of new angiography (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 1.32, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.08–1.62, P = .008) and new revascularization (aHR 1.55, 95% CI 1.18–2.04, P = .002) more than two years after CABG.\n\nInterpretation: Preoperative flow assessment did not improve clinical outcomes and was associated with increased risk for new angiography and revascularization after two years. Further studies are needed to evaluate the applicability of flow assessment in CABG.\n\nTrial registration: Not applicable.\n\nFunding: Not specified.",
