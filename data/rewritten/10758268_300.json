A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Sclerotherapy for Chronic Venous Insufficiency\n\nBackground: Chronic venous insufficiency (CVI) in the lower limbs leads to discomfort and other complications. Sclerotherapy, involving the injection of a sclerosing agent, is a potential treatment for CVI grades 1-6.\n\nMethods: This systematic review and meta-analysis included randomised controlled trials and clinical trials from 2000 to 2023. Participants were patients with lower limb CVI grades C1-C6. The intervention was sclerotherapy, compared to placebo, deferred ablation, and ligation therapy. The primary outcome was quality of life (QoL), measured using the VEINES-QOL scale over 12 months. Randomisation and allocation concealment methods were not specified. Blinding details were not provided.\n\nResults: A total of 9,670 participants were included, with 5,450 in the intervention group and 4,220 in the control group. Sclerotherapy significantly improved QoL (pooled MD = 10.34, 95% CI 8.78 to 11.90, p < 0.00001) and closure rates (pooled RR = 0.72, 95% CI 0.55 to 0.94, p = 0.001). Sclerotherapy was more effective than placebo (pooled MD = -1.64, 95% CI -2.60 to -0.67, p = 0.002) and deferred ablation (pooled MD = -0.22, 95% CI -0.40 to -0.03, p = 0.02). High heterogeneity was observed. Adverse events were not reported.\n\nInterpretation: Sclerotherapy is an effective treatment for improving QoL and closure rates in CVI patients. It outperforms placebo and deferred ablation. Further research is needed to address heterogeneity and optimize treatment protocols.\n\nTrial registration: Not provided.\n\nFunding: Not specified.",
