This study investigates the mechanisms underlying propofol's immunomodulatory activity.\n\nMethods: This randomised controlled trial involved macrophages from Rab5a−/− and WT mice treated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) in vitro and in vivo. Peripheral blood monocytes from septic patients and healthy volunteers were also studied. The primary outcome was the change in membrane TLR4 expression, measured over 24 hours. Randomisation was computer-generated, and allocation was concealed using sealed envelopes. Blinding was applied to outcome assessors.\n\nResults: Propofol significantly reduced membrane TLR4 expression on macrophages in vitro and in vivo. Rab5a was involved in TLR4 intracellular trafficking, and propofol inhibited both Rab5a expression and its interaction with TLR4. In septic patients, Rab5a and TLR4 expression were elevated, but propofol downregulated these expressions. No adverse events were reported.\n\nInterpretation: Propofol reduces membrane TLR4 expression by targeting Rab5a, revealing a novel mechanism for its immunomodulatory effect. Rab5a may serve as a therapeutic target in sepsis.\n\nTrial registration: Not provided.\n\nFunding: Not specified.",
