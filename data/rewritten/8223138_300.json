A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Neoadjuvant Chemoradiotherapy Plus Surgery vs. Surgery Alone for Locally Advanced Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma: A Randomised Controlled Trial\n\nBackground: The prognosis for patients with locally advanced esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) remains poor after surgery. This study aimed to compare the efficacy of neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (NCRT) plus surgery versus surgery alone for long-term survival.\n\nMethods: This multicenter, open-label, phase 3 randomised controlled trial enrolled 451 patients with stage T1-4N1M0/T4N0M0 thoracic ESCC from eight centers in China between June 1, 2007, and December 31, 2014. Patients were randomised 1:1 to receive NCRT plus surgery or surgery alone using computer-generated random numbers with allocation concealment. The primary outcome was overall survival (OS), and the secondary outcome was disease-free survival (DFS). Blinding was not applied.\n\nResults: A total of 224 patients were randomised to the NCRT group and 227 to the surgery group. The intention-to-treat analysis included all participants. By December 31, 2019, 224 deaths occurred. The NCRT group showed improved OS (hazard ratio [HR], 0.74; 95% CI, 0.57-0.97; P = 0.03) and DFS (HR, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.45-0.80; P < 0.001) compared to the surgery group. The 5-year OS rates were 59.9% for the NCRT group and 49.1% for the surgery group. Adverse events were more frequent in the NCRT group, with 54.3% experiencing grade 3 or 4 hematologic toxic effects, and 7.2% experiencing nonhematologic toxic effects.\n\nInterpretation: NCRT plus surgery significantly improved long-term OS and DFS, suggesting it as a standard of care for locally advanced ESCC. The study highlights the importance of this combined treatment modality in improving survival outcomes. Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01216527. Funding: Not specified.",
