A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Neuroprotective Strategies in Coronary Artery Interventions: A Randomised Controlled Trial\n\nBackground: Neurological complications in coronary artery interventions, such as CABG, TECAB, and hybrid revascularization, necessitate effective neuroprotective strategies.\n\nMethods: This randomised controlled trial was conducted to evaluate neuroprotective strategies in coronary interventions. Participants were high-risk patients undergoing CABG, TECAB, or hybrid revascularization. The intervention group received pharmacological neuroprotection, including barbiturates, volatile anesthetics, lidocaine, NMDA receptor antagonists, magnesium, nimodipine, corticosteroids, and aprotinin, while the control group received standard care. Randomisation was computer-generated, with allocation concealment via sealed envelopes. Blinding was applied to outcome assessors.\n\nResults: A total of 200 participants were randomised: 100 to the intervention group and 100 to the control group, between January 2020 and June 2021. The primary outcome was the incidence of neurological complications within 30 days post-surgery. The intervention group showed a significant reduction in complications (mean difference = 5.2%, 95% CI 3.1 to 7.3; p = 0.01). Adverse events were mild, with 3% in the intervention group and 1% in the control group experiencing gastrointestinal side-effects.\n\nInterpretation: Pharmacological neuroprotection significantly reduces neurological complications in coronary interventions. Trial registration: NCT12345678. Funding: Supported by the National Institutes of Health.",
