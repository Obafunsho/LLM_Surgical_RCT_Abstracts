This study evaluates the efficacy of remote ischemic preconditioning (RIPC) in reducing neurocognitive dysfunction in patients undergoing CPB surgery.\n\nMethods: A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) was conducted. Eligible participants were adults undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) with RIPC. The primary outcome was the incidence of POCD, assessed up to 12 months postoperatively. Randomisation and allocation concealment were adequately reported in all studies. Blinding was maintained for participants and personnel. Five RCTs with a total of 1,843 participants were included. Meta-analysis was performed using a fixed-effect model due to low heterogeneity.\n\nResults: RIPC was not associated with a significant reduction in the incidence of POCD (OR = 0.79, 95% CI = 0.56–1.11) or improvement in cognitive function (OR = 0.80, 95% CI = 0.50–1.27). Analysis of specific cognitive function tests, such as RAVLT and VFT, showed no significant improvement with RIPC. No adverse events were reported in either group. The analysis was conducted using an intention-to-treat approach.\n\nInterpretation: The findings indicate that RIPC does not significantly impact cognitive performance in CABG patients. The current evidence is insufficient to recommend RIPC as a neuroprotective intervention in this setting. Further high-quality RCTs with larger sample sizes and standardized protocols are necessary to clarify these findings.\n\nTrial registration: PROSPERO CRD42023430880.\n\nFunding: The study received no financial support.",
