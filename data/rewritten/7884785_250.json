Eligibility criteria included age 20-45 years and BMI 22-27 kg/m². Participants were randomized to receive either a control diet or a diet supplemented with polyphenols, omega-3, vitamin E, and selenium. The primary outcome was endogenous carbon monoxide (CO) elimination, measured by gas chromatography over 60 days. Randomization was computer-generated, and allocation was concealed. Blinding was applied to outcome assessors.\n\nResults: CO elimination increased significantly after 5, 11, 30, and 57 days of bed rest compared to baseline. Bilirubin and iron levels also increased during bed rest. The nutritional intervention did not affect CO elimination. Total hemoglobin mass decreased by 10% after 60 days of bed rest. No adverse events were reported.\n\nInterpretation: Bed rest enhanced hemolysis, contributing to a decrease in total hemoglobin mass. The nutritional intervention had no effect on hemolysis. These findings suggest increased hemolysis as a mechanism for anemia in astronauts.\n\nTrial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT03594799.\n\nFunding: The study was funded by the Center National d’Etudes Spatiales and the European Space Agency.",
