Eligibility criteria included age 18-65 years, radiological confirmation of SAH, and presentation within 96 hours of ictus. Patients were randomised to receive either simvastatin or placebo. Baseline biochemical profiles were taken between ictus and day 4 post-ictus. The primary outcome was the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) at discharge and 6 months. Randomisation was computer-generated, and allocation was concealed. Outcome assessors were blinded.\n\nResults: A total of 803 patients were randomised, with 91% providing baseline biochemical data. Analysis was conducted on an intention-to-treat basis. On admission, 73% of patients were good grade (World Federation of Neurological Surgeons grades 1 or 2), but 84% had a Fisher grade 3 or 4 on CT scan. Higher baseline levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), glucose, and white blood cells, and lower levels of hematocrit, albumin, and hemoglobin were associated with poor outcomes at discharge. CRP was an independent predictor of outcome in good-grade patients. No significant adverse events related to the intervention were reported.\n\nInterpretation: Early recording of CRP may be useful in detecting good-grade patients at greater risk of clinical deterioration and poor outcome.\n\nTrial registration: Not provided.\n\nFunding: Supported by the British Heart Foundation and Wellcome Trust.",
