This study aimed to compare the effects of intravenous and intra-cuff magnesium sulphate on the incidence and severity of these morbidities.\n\nMethods: This single-blind, randomised controlled trial was conducted at Korle-Bu Teaching Hospital, Ghana, involving 90 surgical patients requiring endotracheal intubation. Participants were randomised into three groups: A (control, ETTc inflated with air), B (intra-cuff magnesium sulphate), and C (intravenous magnesium sulphate). The primary outcome was the incidence of PEST during the first 24 postoperative hours. Randomisation was done by balloting, and patients were blinded to the treatment.\n\nResults: Ninety-six patients were enrolled, with 29 in Group A, 29 in Group B, and 32 in Group C completing the study. Intravenous magnesium sulphate significantly reduced the incidence of PEST on swallowing at 4, 8, and 12 hours post-operatively compared to intra-cuff magnesium sulphate. No significant differences were observed in the incidence and severity of cough and hoarseness between groups. No adverse events were reported.\n\nInterpretation: Intravenous magnesium sulphate administered at induction is more effective than intra-cuff magnesium sulphate in reducing the incidence and severity of PEST on swallowing but not at rest. It does not significantly affect post-extubation cough or hoarseness.\n\nTrial registration: PACTR202211634990263.\n\nFunding: Not specified.",
