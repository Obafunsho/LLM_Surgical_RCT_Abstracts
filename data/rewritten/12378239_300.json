A 300-word version\n\nBackground: This study aimed to determine the incidence of postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) in older adults using the Auto-MoCA application and to identify associated risk factors.\n\nMethods: This prospective cohort study was conducted at a university hospital in Bangkok, Thailand, from March to October 2024. Participants were Thai-speaking patients aged 60 years or older scheduled for major elective surgery. Cognitive performance was assessed using the Auto-MoCA application preoperatively, and at 1 week and 3 months postoperatively. \n\nResults: A total of 113 patients were enrolled, with 45 (39.8%) developing POCD at 1 week post-surgery. Of these, 35 completed the 3-month follow-up, and 15 (42.9%) showed cognitive improvement. POCD was associated with declines in visuospatial, attention, language, abstraction, and orientation domains. Cardiovascular comorbidities were a significant risk factor for POCD. The mean MoCA scores showed a slight decline at 1 week, with recovery close to preoperative levels by 3 months. Patients with cardiovascular disease experienced a sharper 1-week decline but improved by 3 months. Male patients showed higher baseline MoCA scores with a smaller initial drop and more robust recovery at 3 months.\n\nInterpretation: POCD affected approximately 40% of older patients undergoing major elective surgery, with cardiovascular conditions being a strong risk factor. Over 40% of patients with early POCD showed cognitive improvement by 3 months. These findings highlight the need for cognitive monitoring and targeted interventions in this population. Future research should focus on enhancing cognitive outcomes in older surgical patients.",
