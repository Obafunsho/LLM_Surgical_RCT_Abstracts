A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Laser Range Scanner for Intraoperative Neurosurgical Navigation\n\nBackground: This study evaluates a novel laser range scanner (LRS) methodology for generating textured cortical surface descriptions to improve image-to-patient registration and cortical feature recognition during neurosurgery.\n\nMethods: A randomised controlled trial was conducted with eight patients undergoing neurosurgery at a single institution. Participants were eligible if they required neurosurgery for various clinical presentations. The intervention involved using an LRS to acquire intraoperative cortical surface descriptions, which were then registered with preoperative magnetic resonance tomograms. The primary outcome was the mean feature alignment error between LRS and magnetic resonance surfaces, measured intraoperatively. Randomisation and allocation concealment methods were not specified. Blinding was not applicable.\n\nResults: All eight patients successfully underwent LRS surface acquisition. The mean feature alignment error was 1.7 ± 0.8 mm. No adverse events were reported.\n\nInterpretation: The LRS methodology demonstrated accurate registration of intraoperative and preoperative data, enhancing cortical feature recognition. This approach shows promise for improving neurosurgical navigation.\n\nTrial registration: Not provided.\n\nFunding: Not specified.",
