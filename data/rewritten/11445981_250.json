This study compares the accuracy of a digital vernier caliper and a digital thickness gauge.\n\nMethods: This randomised controlled trial used 12 porcine vena cava specimens from pigs aged 18-24 weeks. Measurements were performed using a digital vernier caliper (four protocols) and a digital thickness gauge (one protocol). The primary outcome was the consistency and accuracy of thickness measurements over three consecutive trials. Randomisation and allocation concealment methods were not applicable. Blinding was not implemented.\n\nResults: In the first protocol, lower values were observed during the first measurement compared to the second (0.409 ± 0.063 vs. 0.536 ± 0.064, p < 0.0001) and third (0.409 ± 0.063 vs. 0.528 ± 0.055, p = 0.0001). The second protocol showed lower values in the first two measurements compared to the third (p = 0.0279 and p = 0.0054). Protocols three and four recorded higher values for the second and third measurements than the first. The fifth protocol showed no significant differences between measurements (p = 0.953, p = 0.742, p = 0.897).\n\nInterpretation: The digital thickness gauge Mitutoyo 547-500S provided superior accuracy with no differences between three successive measurements, regardless of examiner experience. No adverse events were reported. Trial registration and funding details are not applicable.",
