A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Virtual Reality for Postoperative Pain Management: A Randomised Controlled Trial\n\nBackground: This randomised controlled trial aimed to assess whether a virtual reality (VR) program could decrease acute postoperative pain and opioid requirements in patients recovering from hip arthroplasty.\n\nMethods: We conducted a parallel-group trial involving 106 adults undergoing elective primary total hip arthroplasty at a single hospital. Participants were randomised to receive either 2–8-minute-long three-dimensional immersive VR presentations or two-dimensional nature films with neutral music. The primary outcome was pain after VR or sham video presentations, adjusted for pre-treatment scores, measured on a 0–10 scale. Secondary outcomes included total opioid consumption, pain scores obtained per routine by nursing staff, and pain one week after discharge. Randomisation was computer-generated, and allocation was concealed. Patients and outcome assessors were blinded to group assignments.\n\nResults: 52 patients were randomised to VR and 54 to sham presentations. The mean difference in pain scores was −0.1 points [95% CI: −0.5, 0.2, P=0.391]. The mean after-intervention pain score was 3.4 in the VR group and 3.5 in the control group. The ratio of geometric means for opioid consumption was 1.2 [95% CI: 0.6, 2.1, P=0.608]. Pain scores collected every 4 hours by nursing staff showed a difference in means of 0.1 points [95% CI: −0.9, 0.7, P=0.768]. No adverse events were reported.\n\nInterpretation: VR did not significantly reduce pain scores or opioid consumption. The trial was registered under [Trial Registration Number]. Funding was provided by [Source of Funding]. Further research is needed to explore alternative methods for postoperative pain management.",
