Eligibility criteria included children requiring anesthesia for surgical procedures. Participants were randomly assigned to receive either propofol or a comparator anesthetic. Randomisation was performed using a computer-generated sequence, and allocation was concealed using sealed envelopes. Blinding was applied to outcome assessors, patients, and clinicians.\n\nIntervention: The intervention group received propofol, while the control group received an alternative anesthetic. The primary outcome was the depth of anesthesia, measured using EEG signals over a 24-hour period.\n\nResults: A total of 200 participants were randomised, with 100 in each group. Analysis was conducted on 98 participants in the intervention group and 97 in the control group using an intention-to-treat approach. The mean difference in depth of anesthesia was 5.2 units (95% CI 3.1 to 7.3; p = 0.01). Adverse events were reported in 3% of the intervention group and 1% of the control group, with mild gastrointestinal side-effects.\n\nInterpretation: Propofol significantly improved the depth of anesthesia compared to the control, with a favorable safety profile. The study supports the use of propofol in pediatric anesthesia and highlights its role in advancing infusion pump technology.\n\nTrial registration: NCT12345678\n\nFunding: This trial was funded by the National Institute of Health.",
