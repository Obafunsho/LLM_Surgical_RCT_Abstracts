Participants were consecutively enrolled and randomly assigned to either the intervention or control group. The intervention group received a standard preoperative class plus a joint-specific module addressing recovery during the first 12 months. The control group received only the standard class. The primary outcome was the change in expectation scores, measured preoperatively before and after the class using validated hip-specific or knee-specific surveys. Randomisation was performed using a computer-generated sequence, and allocation was concealed. Blinding was not specified.\n\nResults: In the THA trial, mean changes in expectation scores were +3.3 ± 8 for the intervention group and +4.9 ± 8 for the control group. In the TKA trial, mean changes were −3.4 ± 10 for the intervention group and +2.4 ± 10 for the control group. No adverse events were reported.\n\nInterpretation: Preoperative educational classes can modify patients' expectations of recovery from THA or TKA. The study was registered under trial number [insert number], and funding was provided by [insert source].",
