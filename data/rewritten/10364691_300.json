A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Hughes Closure vs. Standard Mass Closure in Colorectal Cancer Surgery\n\nBackground: Incisional hernias are a frequent complication after abdominal surgery, often necessitating further surgical intervention. This study evaluated the impact of Hughes closure on the incidence of incisional hernia following colorectal cancer surgery.\n\nMethods: Conducted in 28 UK hospitals, this pragmatic multicentre single-blind RCT included patients undergoing midline incision for colorectal cancer. Participants were randomised to Hughes closure (double far–near–near–far sutures with conventional mass closure) or standard closure. The primary outcome was the incidence of incisional hernia at 1 year, assessed by clinical examination. Randomisation occurred in the operating theatre using a 1:1 computerized adaptive system, with allocation concealment by Sealed Envelope. Patients and outcome assessors were blinded. The sample size calculation aimed for 800 patients, anticipating a 20% loss to follow-up.\n\nResults: Between August 2014 and February 2018, 802 patients were randomised (401 per group). At 1 year, 672 patients were analysed (339 Hughes, 333 standard) using intention-to-treat. Incisional hernia was observed in 14.8% of the Hughes group and 17.1% of the standard group (OR 0.84, 95% CI 0.55 to 1.27; P = 0.402). At 2 years, the rates were 28.7% and 31.8%, respectively (OR 0.86, 0.59 to 1.25; P = 0.429). Adverse events were similar between groups, except for a higher rate of surgical-site infections in the Hughes group (13.2% vs. 7.7%; OR 1.82, 1.14 to 2.91; P = 0.011).\n\nInterpretation: The study found no significant difference in the incidence of incisional hernia between Hughes and standard closure techniques. The trial is registered under ISRCTN25616490. Funding was provided by the National Institute for Health Research.",
