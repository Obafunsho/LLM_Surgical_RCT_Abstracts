A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Drug-Eluting Balloon Angioplasty in Preventing In-Stent Restenosis in Postirradiated Carotid Stenosis\n\nBackground: Postirradiated carotid stenosis (PIRCS) is associated with a high risk of in-stent restenosis (ISR) following percutaneous transluminal angioplasty and stenting (PTAS). This study investigates the efficacy and safety of drug-eluting balloon (DEB) angioplasty in preventing ISR in PIRCS.\n\nMethods: This open-label, randomised controlled trial was conducted at a single hospital from July 2017 to July 2021. Sixty-six patients with severe PIRCS were randomly assigned to DEB-PTAS (n=30) or conventional PTAS (n=36) based on the last digit of their chart number. The primary outcome was the degree of ISR at 12 months, assessed by CT/MR angiography. Secondary outcomes included periprocedural neurological complications and recent embolic ischemic lesions (REIL) on early postprocedural MRI. Randomisation was not concealed, and blinding was not applied.\n\nResults: Sixty-five patients were analysed (DEB: 29, conventional: 36). The DEB group demonstrated significantly lower ISR (26.58±8.75% vs 45.93±20.86%; P<0.001) and fewer cases of significant ISR (≥50%) (3.4% vs 38.9%; P=0.029). No significant differences were observed in neurological symptoms (3.4% vs 0%; P=0.197) or REIL numbers (1.0±2.1 vs 1.3±1.5; P=0.592). Peak systolic velocity on short-term ultrasonography was significantly lower in the DEB group (81.95±31.35 vs 104.13±42.76; P=0.023). Adverse events were similar between groups.\n\nInterpretation: DEB-PTAS is associated with a lower degree of ISR and fewer cases of significant ISR compared to conventional PTAS in patients with PIRCS, with similar safety profiles.\n\nTrial registration: Not provided.\n\nFunding: Not disclosed.",
