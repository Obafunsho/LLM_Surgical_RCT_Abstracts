A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Cannulation Strategies in Aortic Arch Surgery\n\nBackground: Aortic arch surgery, particularly in acute type A aortic dissection (ATAAD), is associated with significant mortality and morbidity. This study evaluates the efficacy of different cannulation strategies for cerebral protection.\n\nMethods: This randomised controlled trial was conducted across six Canadian centers. Participants were patients undergoing proximal aortic arch surgery. Eligibility criteria included patients with ATAAD. Participants were randomised to either right axillary or innominate artery cannulation. Randomisation was computer-generated, and allocation was concealed using sealed envelopes. Blinding was not applicable due to the nature of the intervention.\n\nIntervention: The intervention group received right axillary artery cannulation, while the control group received innominate artery cannulation. The primary outcome was the incidence of new severe ischemic lesions, assessed by diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging postoperatively.\n\nResults: A total of 222 participants were randomised, with 111 in each group. The analysis was conducted on an intention-to-treat basis. The incidence of new severe ischemic lesions was similar between the axillary group (34%) and the innominate group (38.8%). Thirty-day mortality and adverse events, including seizures and delirium, were comparable between groups.\n\nInterpretation: Both right axillary and innominate artery cannulation strategies provide similar neuroprotection in aortic arch surgery, although the burden of new neurological lesions remains high. Further research is needed to optimize cannulation strategies.\n\nTrial registration: Not provided.\n\nFunding: Not specified.",
