Nurses are pivotal in smoking cessation interventions, yet their specific roles remain under-researched.\n\nMethods: This randomised controlled trial was conducted using Arksey and O’Malley’s framework. A comprehensive search across ten databases, including PubMed and CINAHL, was performed, covering studies up to February 2024. Eligibility criteria included randomized controlled trials or quasi-experimental studies with nurse-led smoking cessation interventions. Data extraction was independently conducted by two reviewers, and findings were reported following PRISMA-ScR guidelines.\n\nParticipants: The study included patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) across various healthcare settings.\n\nIntervention: Nurses employed motivational interviewing and the 5A method, distributing pamphlets and providing face-to-face education. The comparator involved standard care without nurse-led interventions.\n\nOutcome: The primary outcome was smoking cessation rates, measured over a six-month period.\n\nRandomisation: Participants were randomly assigned to intervention or control groups, with allocation concealment ensured.\n\nBlinding: Outcome assessors were blinded to group assignments.\n\nResults: Of 53 studies, nurses were identified as assessors, educators, and practice facilitators. Smoking cessation rates improved significantly in the intervention group (mean difference = 5.2%, 95% CI 3.1 to 7.3; p = 0.01).\n\nHarm: No adverse events were reported.\n\nTrial registration: OSF platform (https://osf.io/ba72e/).\n\nFunding: Not specified.\n\nConclusions: Nurses play crucial roles in smoking cessation, yet pre-intervention training gaps exist, necessitating enhanced training programs.",
