This study evaluates whether continuous monitoring of vital signs improves patient outcomes compared to usual care.\n\nMethods: We performed a meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) involving non-critical care patients. Participants were randomised to receive either continuous monitoring of vital signs or usual care with intermittent measurements. The primary outcome was hospital mortality, assessed during the hospital stay. Secondary outcomes included major events/complications, HDU/ICU admissions, and length of stay. Searches were conducted in Medline, Embase, and Web of Science, with risk of bias assessed using the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool. Randomisation and allocation concealment methods varied across studies, and blinding was not consistently reported.\n\nResults: Seven RCTs with 1284 participants were included, with 664 randomised to continuous monitoring and 620 to usual care. No statistically significant differences were observed in hospital mortality (OR 0.95, 95% CI 0.59–1.53, p = 0.84), major events/complications (OR 0.71, 95% CI 0.38–1.31, p = 0.27), HDU/ICU admissions (OR 0.82, 95% CI 0.25–2.67, p = 0.74), or length of stay (mean difference = -2.12 days, 95% CI -5.56 to 1.32, p = 0.23). Adverse events were not consistently reported across studies.\n\nInterpretation: Continuous monitoring of vital signs did not significantly improve patient outcomes compared to usual care. The findings suggest the need for further research to explore the impact of different monitoring modalities and the potential benefits of telepresence services and multi-parameter scoring systems.\n\nTrial registration: PROSPERO CRD42023458656.\n\nFunding: Not specified.",
