A 300-word version\n\nTitle: A Randomised Controlled Trial Comparing Robotic-Assisted and Hand-Rasped Techniques in Total Hip Arthroplasty\n\nBackground: This randomised controlled trial evaluated the long-term clinical and radiographic outcomes of robotic-assisted versus hand-rasped femoral component insertion in total hip arthroplasty (THA).\n\nMethods: Conducted at two institutions with five experienced surgeons, the trial included 130 patients eligible for primary cementless THA. Participants were randomized to robotic-assisted (75 hips, 69 patients) or hand-rasped (71 hips, 61 patients) groups using a computer-generated sequence with allocation concealment. The primary outcome was the Japanese Orthopaedic Association (JOA) score, assessed at a minimum follow-up of 10 years. Secondary outcomes included revision surgery, aseptic loosening, and heterotopic ossification, evaluated by blinded assessors. The study followed an intention-to-treat analysis.\n\nResults: At a mean follow-up of 135 months, 115 patients (88%) were available for analysis, with no differential loss to follow-up. JOA scores were similar between groups (robotic: 97 ± 5, hand-rasped: 96 ± 7; mean difference 1.4; p = 0.159). No aseptic loosening or revisions were reported in either group. Heterotopic ossification occurred in 30% of the robotic group and 19% of the hand-rasped group (p = 0.186), with no Grade 4 cases. Adverse events were not reported.\n\nInterpretation: Over a 10-year follow-up, robotic-assisted THA did not yield superior clinical or radiographic outcomes compared to hand-rasped techniques. These results do not support the widespread adoption of robotic milling for stem implantation in primary cementless THAs.\n\nTrial registration: [Trial registration number]\n\nFunding: [Source of funding]",
