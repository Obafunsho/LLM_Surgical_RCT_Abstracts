A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial on the Uptake of Oral Tranexamic Acid During Active Labor\n\nBackground: Postpartum hemorrhage is a leading cause of maternal mortality. While intravenous tranexamic acid (TA) is effective in treating postpartum hemorrhage, its prophylactic effect, particularly via oral administration during active labor, is not well understood. This study aims to evaluate the uptake of oral TA during active labor.\n\nMethods: In this open-label, single-center pilot study, 51 women ≥36 gestational weeks with planned vaginal delivery at Södersjukhuset, Stockholm, were randomized 1:1:1:1 to receive 2 g of TA as an oral solution, tablets, effervescent tablets, or 1 g of intravenous TA. Randomization was computer-generated, and allocation was concealed. Blood samples were collected before and at intervals up to 480 minutes post-administration. Plasma TA concentration was measured using liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry. The primary outcomes were time to therapeutic level, duration in the therapeutic interval, and maximum plasma concentration.\n\nResults: Therapeutic levels were reached at 2 hours for oral (7.11 ± 3.31 mg/L) and 30 minutes for intravenous forms (30.6 ± 15.0 mg/L). Duration in therapeutic intervals was 6 hours for oral and 3.5 hours for intravenous forms (p < 0.007). Peak plasma concentrations were 10.2 ± 3.9 mg/L for oral and 30.6 ± 15.0 mg/L for intravenous forms (p < 0.001). No significant adverse events were reported, with 12% of participants experiencing mild side effects such as nausea and vomiting.\n\nInterpretation: Oral TA shows adequate uptake during labor, with slower and lower uptake compared to intravenous administration but longer duration in the therapeutic interval. The study indicates high feasibility and acceptability of oral TA during labor. Further research is needed to assess its prophylactic efficacy.\n\nTrial registration: EudraCT-2020-002015-22\n\nFunding: Swedish Research Council 2019-06121",
