A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Panitumumab Addition to Hepatic Arterial Infusion and Systemic Chemotherapy in RAS Wild-Type Colorectal Cancer\n\nBackground: This phase II randomised controlled trial assessed whether adding panitumumab (Pmab) to an adjuvant regimen of hepatic arterial infusion (HAI) of floxuridine (FUDR) plus systemic leucovorin, fluorouracil, and irinotecan (FOLFIRI) improves 15-month recurrence-free survival (RFS) in patients with RAS wild-type colorectal cancer.\n\nMethods: Eligible patients with resected colorectal liver metastases (CRLM) and K RAS wild-type were randomised to receive HAI FUDR + SYS FOLFIRI with or without Pmab. Randomisation was stratified by clinical risk score and previous chemotherapy. The primary outcome was 15-month RFS. The trial was registered under NCT01312857. Randomisation and allocation concealment methods were not specified. Blinding details were not provided.\n\nResults: Seventy-five patients were randomised, with 38 in the Pmab arm and 37 in the control arm. At 15 months, 25 patients (69%; 95% CI, 53 to 82) in the Pmab arm and 18 patients (47%; 95% CI, 32 to 63) in the control arm were alive and recurrence-free. The Pmab arm met the decision rule for further investigation. Rash was more frequent in the Pmab arm, but grade 3/4 elevations in bilirubin or alkaline phosphatase were similar between groups. After a median follow-up of 56.6 months, 3-year RFS was 57% (95% CI, 43 to 76) and 42% (95% CI, 29 to 61), and 3-year OS was 97% (95% CI, 90 to 99) and 91% (95% CI, 83 to 99), +/− Pmab, respectively.\n\nInterpretation: The addition of Pmab to HAI FUDR + SYS FOLFIRI showed promising activity in improving 15-month RFS without increased biliary toxicity. Further investigation in a larger trial is warranted. The study was funded by [source of funding].",
