Pulmonary endarterectomy (PEA) is the only potentially curative therapy.\n\nMethods: This randomised controlled trial was conducted at four high-volume CTEPH centers. Participants were adults diagnosed with operable CTEPH. The intervention group underwent PEA, while the control group received standard medical therapy. The primary outcome was the change in pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) measured at 6 months post-intervention. Randomisation was computer-generated, with allocation concealment using sealed envelopes. Outcome assessors were blinded to group allocation.\n\nResults: A total of 200 participants were randomised: 100 to the PEA group and 100 to the control group, between January 2020 and June 2021. In the intention-to-treat analysis, 98 participants in the PEA group and 97 in the control group were analysed. The PEA group showed a significant reduction in PVR compared to the control group (mean difference = 5.2 mm Hg, 95% CI 3.1 to 7.3; p = 0.01). Adverse events were reported in 3/100 (3%) of the PEA group and 1/98 (1%) of the control group, with mild gastrointestinal side-effects.\n\nInterpretation: PEA significantly reduces PVR in operable CTEPH patients compared to standard medical therapy, with a low incidence of adverse events.\n\nTrial registration: [Trial registration number]\n\nFunding: This research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public, commercial, or not-for-profit sectors.",
