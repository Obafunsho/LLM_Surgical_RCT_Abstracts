A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Pain Education and Exercise Training in Primary Dysmenorrhea\n\nBackground: This randomised controlled trial aimed to evaluate the effects of pain neuroscience education (PNE) versus biomedical pain education (BPE), both combined with exercise training (ET), on primary dysmenorrhea (PD).\n\nMethods: The study included nulligravid volunteers aged 18 years and older diagnosed with PD, conducted at a physiotherapy and rehabilitation department. Participants were randomly assigned to PNE+ET or BPE+ET groups. The primary outcome was menstrual pain intensity, assessed over two menstrual cycles. Secondary outcomes included menstrual stress, central sensitization symptoms, and pain catastrophizing. Randomisation was performed using an online tool with a block size of six, and allocation was concealed. Outcome assessors were blinded. A total of 38 participants were randomised: 19 to PNE+ET and 19 to BPE+ET, between January 2022 and June 2022. All participants were analysed using an intention-to-treat approach.\n\nResults: PNE+ET resulted in greater reductions in menstrual pain, central sensitization symptoms, and pain catastrophizing compared to BPE+ET (p < 0.05, Cohen’s d = 0.683–1.174). Menstrual stress decreased similarly in both groups (p > 0.05). No adverse events were reported.\n\nInterpretation: The combination of PNE and ET is more effective than BPE and ET in reducing menstrual pain, central sensitization symptoms, and pain catastrophizing in individuals with PD. These findings suggest that PNE could be a valuable component of PD management. Further studies should investigate the combination of PNE with different education parameters and physiotherapy methods. Trial registration: NCT06040866. Funding: Not specified.",
