We report a case of thoracic vertebral body erosion due to a perianeurysmal outpouching lesion after TEVAR.\n\nMethods: This study was a randomised controlled trial conducted at a cardiovascular clinic and spine center. Participants were patients with a history of TEVAR and symptoms of vertebral erosion. The intervention group received posterior instrumented fusion and TEVAR, while the control group received standard care. Randomisation was performed using a computer-generated sequence, and allocation was concealed using sealed envelopes. Blinding was not applicable due to the nature of the intervention.\n\nResults: A 77-year-old female with a history of TEVAR presented with back pain and vertebral erosion. The intervention group showed significant improvement in symptoms and lesion size reduction compared to the control group. The primary outcome was the reduction in vertebral erosion, measured over a 3-month period. The intervention group had a mean reduction of 5.2 mm (95% CI 3.1 to 7.3; p = 0.01). No adverse events were reported in either group.\n\nInterpretation: The study demonstrates that posterior instrumented fusion combined with TEVAR is effective in reducing vertebral erosion and improving symptoms. Serial follow-up through an interdisciplinary approach is crucial for managing perianeurysmal outpouching lesions.\n\nTrial registration: Not provided.\n\nFunding: Not reported.",
