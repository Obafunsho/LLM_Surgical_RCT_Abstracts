A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial on the Impact of a Standardized Operating Procedure and Educational Program on Adherence to Intraoperative Lung Protective Ventilation\n\nBackground: Adherence to lung-protective ventilation (LPV) reduces perioperative pulmonary complications, yet global adherence is low. This study evaluates the effect of a standardized operating procedure (SOP) with an educational program on adherence to intraoperative lung protective ventilation (IOLPV).\n\nMethods: This prospective, pre-post interventional study was conducted at Masaryk Hospital, Czech Republic, from April 20 to July 18, 2023. Participants were patients undergoing general anesthesia, with 164 patients meeting inclusion criteria. The intervention involved implementing an SOP and educational program. The primary outcome was adherence to the IOLPV bundle, measured over one month pre- and post-intervention. Randomization and blinding were not applicable.\n\nResults: A total of 164 patients were analyzed (Group A: 82 pre-intervention, Group B: 82 post-intervention). Adherence to the IOLPV bundle increased significantly in Group B (Group A: 4%, Group B: 24%; p < 0.001). Recruitment maneuvers were more frequent in Group B (Group A: 11, Group B: 35; p < 0.001). Mean PEEP was higher in Group B (Group A: 6.6 mbar, Group B: 7.8 mbar; p < 0.001). No significant differences were observed in other ventilatory parameters. No adverse events were reported.\n\nTrial registration: NCT05831683.\n\nFunding: Not specified.",
