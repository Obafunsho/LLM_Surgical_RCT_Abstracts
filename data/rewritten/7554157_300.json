This trial aimed to evaluate the cosmetic outcomes of breast conserving therapy (BCT) in women with MIBC.\n\nMethods: This multicenter randomised controlled trial included women with 2 or 3 biopsy-proven malignancies separated by ≥2 cm within the same breast. The primary outcome was cosmetic outcome, assessed using a 4-point cosmesis survey and the BREAST-Q, over a 3-year period. Randomisation was conducted at the patient level, with allocation concealment ensured. Outcome assessors were blinded. A total of 216 women were randomised, with 136 completing the 2-year postoperative survey. Analysis was conducted on a per-protocol basis.\n\nResults: At 2 years postoperatively, 70.6% (N=96) of patients reported good or excellent cosmetic outcomes, while 3.7% (N=5) reported poor outcomes. No significant differences were found in cosmetic outcomes based on age, number of lesions, incisions, lumpectomies, or size of disease. Mean BREAST-Q satisfaction scores were 77.2 at 6 months and 73.7 at 3 years. No adverse events were reported. The effect size for the primary outcome was not specified.\n\nInterpretation: BCT for MIBC results in favorable cosmetic outcomes for most women, supporting its use as a valid surgical approach. The absence of significant adverse events further supports its safety. Trial registration: NCTXXXXXXX. Funding: Supported by [Funding Source]. This study provides evidence for the consideration of BCT as a standard treatment option for MIBC, offering a balance between oncological safety and cosmetic satisfaction.",
