This study evaluates the effectiveness and safety of negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) compared to conventional wound treatment (CWT) for SAWHI.\n\nMethods: This multinational, multicenter, randomized clinical trial was conducted in 34 abdominal surgical departments in Germany, Belgium, and the Netherlands. Adult patients with SAWHI after surgery were randomly assigned to NPWT or CWT in a 1:1 ratio using a centralized web-based tool. The primary outcome was time to wound closure within 42 days. Randomization was stratified by study site and wound size, with allocation concealment ensured. Outcome assessors were blinded.\n\nResults: A total of 539 patients were randomized between August 2, 2011, and January 31, 2018, with 507 included in the modified intention-to-treat analysis (NPWT, 256; CWT, 251). Mean time to wound closure was significantly shorter in the NPWT arm (36.1 days) compared to the CWT arm (39.1 days) (difference, 3.0 days; 95% CI, 1.6-4.4; P < 0.001). Wound closure rate within 42 days was higher with NPWT (35.9%) than CWT (21.5%) (difference, 14.4%; 95% CI, 6.6%-22.2%; P < 0.001). The risk of wound-related adverse events was higher in the NPWT arm (risk ratio, 1.51; 95% CI, 0.99-2.35).\n\nInterpretation: NPWT is effective for SAWHI but associated with more wound-related adverse events.
