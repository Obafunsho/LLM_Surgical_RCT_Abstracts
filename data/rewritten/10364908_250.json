A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial Comparing 125 I Seed and Hookwire Localization in Breast-Conserving Surgery\n\nBackground: This multicentre randomised controlled trial aimed to compare re-excision and positive margin rates in breast-conserving surgery using 125 I seed versus hookwire localization in women with non-palpable breast cancer.\n\nMethods: Between September 2013 and March 2018, 690 women with non-palpable breast cancer eligible for breast-conserving surgery were randomised to preoperative localization using 125 I seeds or hookwires at eight sites. Randomization was stratified by lesion type and study site, with allocation concealed via a secure online database. The primary outcomes were re-excision and positive margin rates, measured post-surgery. Secondary outcomes included resection volumes and weights. The analysis was conducted on an intention-to-treat basis.\n\nResults: Of the 690 women randomised, 659 were analysed (327 in the 125 I seed group and 332 in the HWL group). The re-excision rate was significantly lower in the 125 I seed group compared to the HWL group (13.9% vs. 18.9%; p = 0.019). No significant differences were observed in positive margin rates or specimen weights and volumes. Adverse events included suboptimal positioning requiring corrective action in 9 cases for seeds and 13 for wires.\n\nInterpretation: 125 I seed localization significantly reduced re-excision rates compared to HWL in breast-conserving surgery.
