A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Long-term Outcomes of Immediate vs. Postponed Drainage in Infected Necrotizing Pancreatitis: A Randomised Controlled Trial\n\nBackground: The POINTER trial aimed to compare the long-term outcomes of immediate versus postponed drainage in patients with infected necrotizing pancreatitis.\n\nMethods: Conducted in 22 Dutch hospitals, this multicenter randomised controlled trial enrolled 104 patients with infected necrotizing pancreatitis between August 2015 and October 2019. Patients were randomised to immediate catheter drainage (55 patients) or postponed catheter drainage (49 patients). The primary outcome was a composite of death and major complications, assessed over a median follow-up of 51 months. Randomisation was computer-generated, and allocation was concealed. Blinding was not applied.\n\nResults: Of the 104 patients, 88 were re-evaluated after the initial 6-month follow-up. The primary outcome occurred in 7 of 47 patients (15%) in the immediate-drainage group and 7 of 41 patients (17%) in the postponed-drainage group (RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.33–2.28; P = 0.78). Additional drainage procedures were required in 7 patients (15%) versus 3 patients (7%) (RR 2.03; 95% CI 0.56–7.37; P = 0.34). The median number of interventions was higher in the immediate-drainage group than in the postponed-drainage group (4 vs. 1, P = 0.001). No significant differences in adverse events were reported between groups.\n\nInterpretation: Postponed drainage using antibiotics results in fewer interventions compared to immediate drainage, with similar long-term outcomes in pancreatic function and quality of life. This approach should be preferred in managing infected necrotizing pancreatitis, as it reduces the need for interventions without increasing the risk of adverse long-term outcomes.\n\nTrial registration: ISRCTN33682933\n\nFunding: This research did not receive any specific funding.",
