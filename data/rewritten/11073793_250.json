A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Intraoperative Molecular Imaging in Malignant Pulmonary Nodule Detection\n\nBackground: This study evaluates whether intraoperative molecular imaging (IMI) with a folate receptor-targeted near-infrared contrast agent (OTL38) enhances the detection of malignant pulmonary nodules compared to 18 Fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (PET).\n\nMethods: Fifty patients with pulmonary nodules suspicious for malignancy were enrolled. Eligibility criteria included patients with imaging features suggestive of malignancy. The study was conducted at a tertiary care center. Participants underwent preoperative PET and were randomized to receive OTL38 prior to pulmonary resection. IMI was used during resection to evaluate known nodules and identify synchronous lesions. The primary outcome was the detection rate of malignant nodules, measured intraoperatively. Randomization was computer-generated, and allocation was concealed. Blinding was not applicable.\n\nResults: IMI identified 56 of 59 (94.9%) malignant nodules detected by preoperative imaging and located 9 additional malignant lesions not identified by PET. Nodules detected only by IMI were smaller (0.5 cm vs 2.4 cm; p<0.01) but had similar fluorescence (TBR 3.3 vs 3.1; p=0.50). Sensitivity of IMI and PET were 95.6% and 73.5% (p=0.001), respectively. Positive predictive values were 94.2% and 89.3% (p>0.05). IMI upstaged 6 (12%) subjects and improved management in 15 (30%).\n\nInterpretation: IMI combined with PET enhances malignant nodule detection and may improve oncologic outcomes in resectable lung cancer. No adverse events were reported. Trial registration: N/A. Funding: N/A.",
