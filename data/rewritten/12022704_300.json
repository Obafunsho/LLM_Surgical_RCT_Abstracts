A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial on Blood Transfusion in Total Knee Replacement\n\nBackground: Total knee replacement (TKR) is a common procedure for end-stage knee osteoarthritis but involves significant perioperative blood loss, often necessitating allogenic blood transfusion (ABT). This study aimed to determine the prevalence of ABT and identify factors affecting transfusion and blood loss.\n\nMethods: Conducted at Hospital Melaka, this retrospective cross-sectional study included 296 adult patients who underwent elective primary unilateral TKR from January 2015 to December 2019. Participants were selected based on primary knee osteoarthritis and unilateral TKR, excluding those with haematological disorders or secondary osteoarthritis. Data on ABT incidence, demographics, antiplatelet/anticoagulant use, tourniquet time, anaesthesia type, and haemoglobin levels were collected. The primary outcome was the prevalence of ABT, assessed postoperatively.\n\nResults: The prevalence of ABT was 4.39% (95% CI 2.04, 6.74). Pre-operative haemoglobin was the only significant factor associated with ABT (P<0.001; OR=0.35; 95% CI 0.22, 0.54). Prolonged tourniquet time (>120 minutes) significantly increased blood loss, with participants having 2.67 times the odds of >2 g/dL blood loss compared to those with ≤120 minutes (95% CI=1.54, 4.64). No adverse events were reported.\n\nInterpretation: The prevalence of ABT in our centre was lower than in other studies. Optimising pre-operative haemoglobin levels can reduce the need for ABT. The study highlights the importance of managing pre-operative anaemia and minimizing tourniquet time to control blood loss. The study was not registered as a trial and received no specific funding. Further prospective studies are recommended to explore the impact of transfusions on clinical outcomes.",
