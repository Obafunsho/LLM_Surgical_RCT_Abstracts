A 250-word version\n\nTitle: EAGLE: A Randomised Controlled Trial to Reduce Anastomotic Leaks after Right Colectomy\n\nBackground: Anastomotic leak occurs in 8% of patients post-right colectomy, significantly increasing postoperative mortality. This study aimed to evaluate whether a standardized international quality improvement intervention could reduce anastomotic leak rates.\n\nMethods: This multicentre, batched, cluster-randomized trial involved hospital teams as the unit of randomization. The intervention included an online educational module, risk stratification, an intraoperative checklist, and harmonized surgical techniques. Clusters were randomized using a stepped-wedge design. The primary outcome was the anastomotic leak rate within 30 days post-surgery. Patients were blinded to allocation. The study was conducted in 332 hospital teams across 64 countries, with 39.2% from low- and middle-income countries.\n\nResults: A total of 355 hospital teams registered, with 332 included in the final analysis. Of 4411 surgeons, 2143 completed the modules. The primary analysis included 3039 of 3268 patients, with leak rates of 10.1% before and 9.6% after intervention (adjusted OR 0.87, 95% CI 0.59 to 1.30; P = 0.498). High-engagement centres showed a decrease from 12.2% to 5.1% (adjusted OR 0.36, 95% CI 0.20 to 0.64; P < 0.001).\n\nInterpretation: Digital training by engaged teams can reduce anastomotic leak rates. No adverse events were reported. Trial registration: NCT04270721. Funding: Euros 460,000.",
