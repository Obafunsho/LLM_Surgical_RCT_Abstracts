Eligibility criteria encompassed studies on elderly patients (aged 60 and above) undergoing surgery, with sarcopenia diagnosed using validated criteria. The primary outcome was the incidence of postoperative delirium, with secondary outcomes including other complications and recovery metrics. Subgroup analyses were based on surgery types. The Quality in Prognosis Studies (QUIPS) tool assessed risk of bias.\n\nResults: From 10,981 records, 265 studies were included in the review, and 242 in the meta-analysis. Sarcopenia was significantly associated with postoperative delirium (univariable: OR 1.81, 95% CI 1.31 to 2.50, P < 0.001; multivariable: OR 2.42, 95% CI 1.27 to 4.59, P = 0.007). Sarcopenia also correlated with increased complications, mortality, delayed recovery, and reduced overall survival. No significant associations were found for postoperative pancreatic fistula or recurrence. Subgroup analyses indicated higher risk of reduced overall survival in sarcopenic patients undergoing head and neck or heart and chest surgeries.\n\nInterpretation: Sarcopenia is a strong independent predictor of postoperative delirium and adverse outcomes in elderly surgical patients. The findings underscore the importance of preoperative sarcopenia screening to identify high-risk individuals and tailor perioperative management strategies. Future research should focus on standardizing sarcopenia diagnostic criteria and evaluating targeted interventions to improve surgical outcomes in this population.\n\nSystematic review registration: PROSPERO CRD42023424696 (18 May 2023).\n\nFunding: Not specified.",
