A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Biventricular Pacing After Cardiac Surgery: A Randomised Controlled Trial\n\nBackground: This randomised controlled trial evaluates the hemodynamic effects of temporary biventricular pacing in patients at risk of left ventricular dysfunction post-cardiac surgery. The study aims to compare the efficacy of biventricular pacing versus atrial pacing.\n\nMethods: Conducted in a cardiac surgery unit, the trial included patients eligible based on risk of left ventricular dysfunction. Participants were randomised to continuous biventricular pacing (n = 16) or standard of care (n = 18) using a computer-generated sequence with allocation concealment. Blinding details were not specified. The primary outcome was hemodynamic improvement, assessed by cardiac output and vasoactive-inotropic score, over the first 24 hours post-bypass.\n\nResults: Thirty-four patients were randomised and analysed. At 12 to 24 hours post-bypass, the paced group exhibited a lower intrinsic heart rate (76.5 ± 17.5 vs 91.7 ± 13.0 beats per minute; P = .040). Cardiac output was higher in the paced group (4.4 ± 1.2 vs 3.6 ± 1.9 L/min; P = .054), and stroke volume increased (53 ± 2 vs 42 ± 2 mL; P = .051). Vasoactive medication doses were similar between groups, but dexmedetomidine administration was extended in the paced group (793 ± 528 vs 478 ± 295 minutes; P = .013). No adverse events were reported.\n\nInterpretation: Biventricular pacing enhances hemodynamics and reduces intrinsic heart rate post-cardiac surgery, indicating a reduction in sympathetic drive. These findings suggest potential benefits of biventricular pacing, warranting further investigation. Trial registration and funding information were not provided.",
