A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial on Medium-Term Restenosis Rates in Carotid Endarterectomy with Biological vs. Synthetic Patches\n\nBackground: Carotid endarterectomy (CEA) with patch angioplasty reduces restenosis rates compared to primary closure. However, evidence on the superiority of patch materials in preventing restenosis is limited.\n\nMethods: This single-centre retrospective study identified all primary CEA with patch angioplasty performed between 2007 and 2019 at a university hospital. Participants included patients with symptomatic or asymptomatic 50–99% internal carotid artery stenosis. The primary outcome was moderate (50–69%) and critical (70–99%) restenosis, defined by duplex ultrasonography criteria. Bovine pericardium served as the biological patch, while Dacron, ePTFE, and polyester-urethane were synthetic comparators. Chi-square tests and Kaplan-Meier curves compared restenosis rates.\n\nResults: A total of 127 CEAs were analysed, with 75 using bovine pericardium. Median follow-up was 40 months. Moderate restenosis occurred in 14 CEAs (11%), and critical restenosis in 10 (7.8%). Bovine patches were significantly associated with >50% restenosis (p = 0.042) but not >70% (p = 0.197). Kaplan-Meier curves showed similar restenosis rates at five years (p = 0.081 and p = 0.080). No significant differences in peri-operative complications were observed between patch types.\n\nInterpretation: Medium-term restenosis rates after CEA are similar between biological and synthetic patches. Randomised controlled trials are needed to determine the superior patch material for carotid reconstruction.",
