Participants were randomised using a computer-generated sequence, with allocation concealed in opaque envelopes. The AR-based system was compared to the accelerometer-based system, with the primary outcome being the absolute difference in cup placement angles measured on postoperative radiographs. The outcome assessors and patients were blinded. A sample size of 60 per group was calculated to detect a 2° difference in cup placement angle, assuming a standard deviation of 3.8°.\n\nResults: Between August and December 2021, 126 patients were randomised (62 to AR group, 64 to accelerometer group). The mean absolute difference in radiographic anteversion angle was smaller in the AR group (2° ± 2°) compared to the accelerometer group (5° ± 4°; 95% CI -4.2° to -2.0°; p < 0.001). There were no significant differences in radiographic inclination angle or operative time between groups. Few complications were observed: in the AR group, one patient each experienced a surgical site infection, intraoperative fracture, distal deep vein thrombosis, and pin loosening; in the accelerometer group, one patient each had an intraoperative fracture and pin loosening.\n\nInterpretation: The AR-based system demonstrated slight improvements in radiographic anteversion accuracy. However, the clinical significance of these differences remains uncertain. Until further studies demonstrate clear clinical benefits, the widespread use of AR-based systems is not recommended due to additional costs.\n\nTrial registration: [Trial registration number]\n\nFunding: [Source of funding]",
