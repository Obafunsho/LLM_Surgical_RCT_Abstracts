A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Common-Iliac-Artery Skirt Technology in Iliac Artery Aneurysms\n\nBackground: This study evaluates the efficacy of a novel common-iliac-artery skirt technology (CST) compared to internal iliac artery embolization (IIAE) in treating iliac artery aneurysms.\n\nMethods: This retrospective study screened 524 patients who underwent endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) from 2014 to 2020. Eligible patients were those with iliac artery aneurysms treated with either CST or IIAE. The primary outcome was the technical success rate, defined as complete exclusion of aneurysms without endoleak. Secondary outcomes included surgery time, hospital stay, and major adverse events (MAEs). \n\nResults: A total of 72 patients were included, with 39 in the CST group and 26 in the IIAE group. CST demonstrated a shorter surgery time (97.42 ± 3.891 minutes vs. 141.0 ± 8.010 minutes, p < 0.001) and hospital stay (15.35 ± 0.873 days vs. 19.32 ± 1.067 days, p = 0.009). The CST group had lower in-hospital MAEs (0% vs. 11.5%, p = 0.059) and 1-year follow-up MAEs (6.7% vs. 28.6%, p = 0.052). No significant differences in mortality or long-term MAEs were observed. \n\nInterpretation: CST is a feasible and effective alternative to IIAE for iliac artery aneurysms, offering reduced surgery time and hospital stay with comparable safety outcomes.\n\nTrial registration: Not provided.\n\nFunding: Supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China and the Natural Science Foundation of Hunan Province.",
