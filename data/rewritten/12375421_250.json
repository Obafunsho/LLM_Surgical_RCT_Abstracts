This study evaluates the efficacy of concomitant mitral valve intervention during coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG).\n\nMethods: A randomised controlled trial was conducted at a single Italian center. Participants included 102 patients with moderate IMR undergoing CABG. Eligibility criteria included patients with moderate IMR and CAD. Participants were randomised into two groups: CABG alone (n=54) and CABG with mitral valve repair (n=48). Randomisation was computer-generated, with allocation concealment ensured. Blinding was applied to outcome assessors.\n\nResults: The primary outcome was quality of life improvement, measured over four years. The CABG with mitral valve repair group showed significant improvement in quality of life and reduced symptoms compared to the CABG alone group. Echocardiological assessments revealed better left ventricular function in the intervention group. Adverse events were more frequent in the CABG alone group, with 3% experiencing mild complications compared to 1% in the intervention group.\n\nInterpretation: Concomitant mitral valve repair during CABG in moderate IMR patients enhances quality of life and cardiac function. The findings support the integration of mitral interventions in surgical planning for IMR with CAD.\n\nTrial registration: Not provided.\n\nFunding: Not disclosed.",
