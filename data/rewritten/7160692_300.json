A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial Comparing Pancreaticojejunostomy and Pancreaticogastrostomy in High-Risk Postoperative Pancreatic Fistula Patients\n\nBackground: Postoperative pancreatic fistula (POPF) is a critical complication after pancreaticoduodenectomy, especially in high-risk patients. This study evaluates whether pancreaticojejunostomy (PJ) or pancreaticogastrostomy (PG), both with externalized transanastomotic stent, is superior in reducing POPF incidence.\n\nMethods: Conducted at the Department of General and Pancreatic Surgery, The Pancreas Institute, University of Verona Hospital Trust, Italy, this single-center, phase 3, randomized controlled trial spanned from July 12, 2017, to March 15, 2019. Adults undergoing elective pancreaticoduodenectomy with a high fistula risk score (7-10) were randomized to PJ or PG. Randomization used a computer-generated sequence with allocation concealment. Blinding was not implemented. The primary outcome was POPF incidence, assessed postoperatively. Secondary outcomes included Clavien-Dindo grade 3 or higher morbidity, postpancreatectomy hemorrhage, and delayed gastric emptying.\n\nResults: Of 604 screened, 72 were randomized (36 to PJ, 36 to PG). POPF incidence was not significantly different (PJ: 38.9%, PG: 50.0%; P = .48). However, PJ resulted in a lower average complication burden in POPF cases (0.25 vs 0.39; P = .04). PG was associated with higher Clavien-Dindo grade 3 or higher morbidity (47.2% vs 22.2%; P = .047). Rates of postpancreatectomy hemorrhage and delayed gastric emptying were similar between groups.\n\nInterpretation: For patients at high risk of POPF, PJ with externalized stent and octreotide omission is preferable due to reduced complication burden and morbidity. \n\nTrial Registration: NCT03212196\n\nFunding: Not specified.",
