This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of prophylactic medical therapy in reducing the incidence of postoperative AF.\n\nMethods: This randomised controlled trial was conducted at a cardiac surgery center. Eligible participants were patients undergoing cardiac surgery. Participants were randomly assigned to receive either prophylactic medical therapy or standard care. The primary outcome was the incidence of postoperative AF within 7 days post-surgery. Randomisation was computer-generated, and allocation was concealed using sealed envelopes. Blinding was applied to outcome assessors.\n\nResults: A total of 420 participants were randomised, with 210 in each group, between January 2020 and June 2021. Analysis included 205 participants in the intervention group and 203 in the control group, using an intention-to-treat approach. The incidence of postoperative AF was significantly lower in the intervention group (17%) compared to the control group (32%), with a risk reduction of 15% (95% CI 8% to 22%; p=0.007). Adverse events were reported in 3% of the intervention group and 1% of the control group, primarily mild gastrointestinal side-effects.\n\nTrial registration: NCT12345678.\n\nFunding: This study was funded by the National Heart Institute.",
