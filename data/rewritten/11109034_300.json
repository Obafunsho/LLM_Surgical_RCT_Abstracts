A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Oral PDE-5 Inhibitors in Children with VSD and Pulmonary Hypertension\n\nBackground: This study aimed to assess the impact of oral phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE-5) inhibitors on postoperative pulmonary hypertension (PH) and right ventricular (RV) function in children with ventricular septal defect (VSD).\n\nMethods: Conducted as a prospective, randomised, double-blinded, single-centre trial at a tertiary cardiac referral centre, 51 children with VSD and PH were enrolled. Participants were randomly assigned to receive either sildenafil or tadalafil (n=34) or placebo (n=17) one week before and for three months after corrective surgery. The primary outcome was the change in right ventricle systolic pressure (RVSP) and mean pulmonary artery pressure (mPAP) postoperatively and at follow-up. Randomisation was computer-generated, and allocation was concealed. Blinding included outcome assessors, patients, and clinicians.\n\nResults: No significant difference was observed in RVSP improvement between the PDE-5 inhibitor group and the placebo group postoperatively (p=0.255) and at follow-up (p=0.259). Changes in mPAP were also not significantly different postoperatively (p=0.788) and at follow-up (p=0.059). RV function decreased postoperatively in both groups but improved at follow-up, with no significant difference between groups. ICU stay length was similar (p=0.143). Two deaths occurred in the PDE-5 group: one due to brady/asystole and another due to subarachnoid hemorrhage. One patient experienced a pulmonary hypertensive crisis. No significant adverse events were reported in the placebo group.\n\nInterpretation: Perioperative administration of PDE-5 inhibitors did not significantly impact PA pressure, RV function, or ICU stay.
