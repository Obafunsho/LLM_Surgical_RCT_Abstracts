This study investigates the potential of engineered extracellular vesicles (EVs) as a novel therapeutic approach for OA.\n\nMethods: Conducted as a randomised controlled trial at a tertiary care hospital, the study included adults with clinically diagnosed knee OA. Participants were randomised into two groups: the intervention group received engineered EVs, while the control group received standard care. Randomisation was achieved using a computer-generated sequence, with allocation concealment ensured through sealed envelopes. Outcome assessors were blinded to group assignments.\n\nResults: A total of 200 participants were randomised, with 100 allocated to each group, during the recruitment period from January 2020 to June 2021. An intention-to-treat analysis was performed on 98 participants in the intervention group and 97 in the control group. The primary outcome, joint function improvement, was assessed over a 12-month period. The intervention group exhibited a significant improvement in joint function (mean difference = 5.2, 95% CI 3.1 to 7.3; p = 0.01). Adverse events were minimal, with 3% of the intervention group and 1% of the control group experiencing mild gastrointestinal side-effects.\n\nInterpretation: The study demonstrates that engineered EVs significantly enhance joint function in OA patients compared to standard care, with a favorable safety profile. These findings suggest that EVs could be a promising alternative in OA treatment, warranting further investigation in larger trials.\n\nTrial registration: NCT12345678\n\nFunding: This trial was funded by the National Institutes of Health.",
