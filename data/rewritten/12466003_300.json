This study assesses the efficacy of bilateral superficial cervical plexus block (BSCPB) with and without adjuncts in reducing postoperative pain.\n\nMethods: A systematic search of PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane Library, and Embase was conducted to identify randomized controlled trials and observational studies on BSCPB in thyroid and parathyroid surgeries. The primary outcome was the reduction in postoperative pain, measured by Visual Analog Scale scores at 6–24 hours post-surgery. Randomization and allocation concealment methods were not specified. Blinding details were not provided. A total of 1507 patients were included, with 753 in the BSCPB group. The analysis was conducted using a random-effects model.\n\nResults: The pooled analysis showed that BSCPB significantly reduced postoperative pain compared to control (pooled risk ratio = 0.390, 95% CI: 0.303–0.501, p<0.05). The most significant reduction in pain was observed in the 6–24 hours after surgery. Subgroup analysis revealed that the addition of adjuncts like dexmedetomidine or ropivacaine provided modest further pain relief. Adverse events were not reported.\n\nInterpretation: BSCPB is a highly effective method for reducing postoperative pain following thyroid and parathyroid surgeries. The addition of adjuncts offers some additional pain relief, supporting the use of BSCPB as an opioid-sparing pain management strategy. Trial registration: PROSPERO CRD420251039306.
