This study aimed to evaluate cosmetic outcomes in women with MIBC treated with breast conserving therapy (BCT).\n\nMethods: This multicenter randomised controlled trial enrolled women with 2 or 3 biopsy-proven malignancies separated by ≥2 cm within the same breast. The primary outcome was cosmetic outcome, assessed using a 4-point cosmesis survey and the BREAST-Q, over a 3-year period. Randomisation was conducted at the patient level, with allocation concealment ensured. Blinding was applied to outcome assessors. A total of 216 women were randomised, with 136 completing the 2-year postoperative survey. Analysis was conducted on a per-protocol basis.\n\nResults: At 2 years postoperatively, 70.6% (N=96) of patients reported good or excellent cosmetic outcomes, while 3.7% (N=5) reported poor outcomes. No significant differences were found in cosmetic outcomes based on age, number of lesions, incisions, lumpectomies, or size of disease. Mean BREAST-Q satisfaction scores were 77.2 at 6 months and 73.7 at 3 years. No adverse events were reported.\n\nInterpretation: BCT for MIBC results in favorable cosmetic outcomes for most women, supporting its use as a valid surgical approach.
