This study aimed to evaluate the effect of super-oxidized solution in reducing SSI risk.\n\nMethods: This multicentre, triple-blind, randomised controlled trial was conducted at Queen Elizabeth Hospital and Queen Elizabeth II Hospital, Malaysia, from September 2020 to March 2022. Patients aged 13 years and older with perforated appendicitis undergoing open appendicectomy were randomised to receive peritoneal and wound lavage with either super-oxidized solution or normal saline. The primary outcome was SSI within 30 days post-surgery. Randomisation was computer-generated with allocation concealment using opaque, sequentially numbered, sealed envelopes. Patients, surgeons, outcome assessors, and statisticians were blinded.\n\nResults: A total of 102 patients were randomised (51 per group) and included in the intention-to-treat analysis. The super-oxidized solution group showed a significant reduction in overall SSI (15.6% vs. 37.2%; RR 0.42; 95% CI 0.20 to 0.87; P = 0.014) and superficial SSI (9.8% vs. 35.3%; RR 0.28; 95% CI 0.11 to 0.69; P = 0.002), with a number-needed-to-treat of four. No adverse events were reported.\n\nInterpretation: Super-oxidized solution is superior to normal saline in preventing SSI after open appendicectomy for perforated appendicitis.\n\nTrial Registration: ClinicalTrial.gov Identifier: NCT04512196\n\nFunding: Ministry of Health Research Grant",
