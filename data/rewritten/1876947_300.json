A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Adjuvant Interferon Therapy in Hepatitis B-Related Hepatocellular Carcinoma\n\nBackground: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) recurrence is frequent post-hepatic resection. Interferon, with its antiviral, immunomodulatory, antiproliferative, and antiangiogenic properties, may enhance post-resection prognosis.\n\nMethods: In this randomised controlled trial, patients with no residual disease after hepatic resection for predominantly hepatitis B-related HCC were enrolled from February 1999 to June 2002. Participants were stratified by pTNM stage and randomly assigned to no treatment (control) or interferon alpha-2b 10 MIU/m² thrice weekly for 16 weeks (IFN-I group). A higher dose group was terminated due to adverse effects. Randomisation was performed using a computer-generated sequence with allocation concealment. Blinding was not implemented.\n\nResults: A total of 80 patients were randomised: 40 to the control group and 40 to the IFN-I group. The primary outcome was overall survival, assessed at 1 and 5 years. The 1- and 5-year survival rates were 85% and 61% for the control group, and 97% and 79% for the IFN-I group (P = 0.137). The relative risk of death for interferon treatment was 0.42 (95% CI, 0.17–1.05; P = 0.063). Exploratory analysis indicated no survival benefit for pTNM stage I/II tumors but improved 5-year survival for stage III/IVA tumors from 24% to 68% (P = 0.038). Adverse effects led to discontinuation in the higher dose group.\n\nInterpretation: Adjuvant interferon therapy demonstrated a trend for survival benefit, notably in patients with pTNM stage III/IVA tumors. Further larger trials are warranted. Trial registration and funding details were not provided.",
