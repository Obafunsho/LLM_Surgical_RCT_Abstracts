  "abstract": "Title: A Randomised Controlled Trial of Nail Bed Repair with or without Fingernail Replacement in Children\n\nBackground: Nail bed injuries are common in children, and the decision to replace the nail plate after repair is debated. This study aimed to evaluate the clinical and cost-effectiveness of nail bed repair with versus without fingernail replacement.\n\nMethods: This multicentre, two-arm, 1:1 parallel-group superiority RCT was conducted across 20 UK hospitals. Participants were children under 16 years with a nail bed injury requiring surgical repair. The intervention group had the fingernail replaced, while the control group had it discarded. The co-primary outcomes were surgical-site infection at 7–10 days and cosmetic appearance at 4–12 months. Randomisation was computer-generated with allocation concealment, and outcome assessors were blinded.\n\nResults: A total of 451 children were randomised between July 2018 and December 2019, with 224 in the nail-discarded group and 227 in the nail-replaced group. Analysis included 218 and 222 participants, respectively, using an intention-to-treat approach. No significant difference was found in infection rates (OR 2.49, 95% CI 0.58 to 10.61; p = 0.218) or cosmetic appearance (p = 0.118). The nail-discarded group had a mean cost saving of €84 (95% CI 34 to 140; p < 0.001). Two serious adverse events were reported, one in each group.\n\nInterpretation: Discarding the fingernail after nail bed repair is as effective as replacement in terms of infection and cosmetic outcomes, with significant cost savings.
