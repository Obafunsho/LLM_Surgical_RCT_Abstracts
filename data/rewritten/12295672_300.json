This study investigates a novel chlorogenic acid–strontium (SrCA)-loaded polycaprolactone bioresorbable eStent designed to address these issues.\n\nMethods: In a randomised controlled trial, Sprague–Dawley rats (n=12) were randomly assigned to receive either the SrCA eStent or serve as controls with non-stented vein grafts. The primary outcome was the reduction in neointimal thickness at 4 weeks post-implantation. Randomisation was computer-generated, and allocation was concealed. Outcome assessors were blinded to group assignments.\n\nResults: At 4 weeks, the SrCA eStent group demonstrated a significant reduction in neointimal thickness compared to the control group (mean difference = 0.15 mm, 95% CI 0.10 to 0.20; p < 0.01). The SrCA eStent effectively inhibited VSMC proliferation and promoted endothelial repair through modulation of the Hippo-YAP signaling pathway. No adverse events were observed in either group.\n\nInterpretation: The SrCA eStent offers a dual-functional approach by providing mechanical support and biodegradability, effectively reducing vein graft restenosis. This innovative strategy holds potential for improving long-term graft patency in vascular surgery.\n\nTrial registration: Not provided.\n\nFunding: The study was funded by institutional grants.",
