A 300-word version\n\nTitle: BASIL-2: A Randomised Controlled Trial of Revascularization Strategies in CLTI\n\nBackground: Chronic limb-threatening ischaemia (CLTI) presents a substantial burden on healthcare systems globally. This study aimed to assess the cost-effectiveness and cost-utility of a vein bypass (VB) first versus a best endovascular treatment (BET) first revascularization strategy in patients with CLTI requiring infra-popliteal revascularization.\n\nMethods: BASIL-2 was an open-label, multicentre, phase 3 randomised controlled trial conducted in 41 vascular surgery units across the UK, Sweden, and Denmark. Participants were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to either VB-first or BET-first strategies. The primary outcome was amputation-free survival (AFS) over a 2- to 7-year follow-up period. Randomisation was computer-generated, and allocation was concealed. The analysis was conducted on an intention-to-treat basis.\n\nResults: A total of 345 participants were randomised (172 to VB-first, 173 to BET-first) between July 2014 and November 2020. At two years, the mean hospital cost was £15,743 in the VB-first group and £13,274 in the BET-first group, with BET-first showing lower costs (–£2,524, 95% CI –£5,845 to £1,132). BET-first was more effective, yielding additional amputation-free life years (AFLYs) (0.429, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.88) and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) (0.016, 95% CI –0.08 to 0.12). No significant adverse events were reported in either group.\n\nInterpretation: The BET-first revascularization strategy was more cost-effective and efficient than the VB-first strategy, with findings consistent across various scenarios and subgroups. The trial was registered with ISRCTN27728689 and funded by the NIHR HTA. These results suggest that a BET-first strategy should be recommended for CLTI patients requiring infra-popliteal revascularization.",
