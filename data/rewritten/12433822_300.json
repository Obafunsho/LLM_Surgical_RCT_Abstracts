  "abstract": "2. A 300-word version\n\nBackground: Cyanoacrylate glue closure has been used for venous reflux treatment, but specific adverse reactions require further investigation to improve patient selection and minimize events. This study systematically reviews literature to identify reported reactions and explore their pathophysiology.\n\nMethods: A systematic review was conducted using MeSH terms related to cyanoacrylate and venous diseases, focusing on literature from 2012 to 2022. The search was limited to English reports. Covidence software facilitated full-text screening and data extraction, with two reviewers and a content expert as a tiebreaker.\n\nResults: From 102 identified reports, 55 were suitable for data extraction. Adverse reactions included phlebitis, hypersensitivity, foreign body granuloma, and endovenous glue-induced thrombosis.\n\nInterpretation: Cyanoacrylate glue is generally a safe and effective treatment for chronic venous disease, but some adverse events may be specific to the product's properties. Proposed mechanisms for these reactions are based on histologic changes, published reports, and case examples. Further research is necessary to confirm these theories and improve patient outcomes.",
