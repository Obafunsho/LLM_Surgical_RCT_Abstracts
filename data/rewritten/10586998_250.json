A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Analgesia Regimens for Esophagectomy\n\nBackground: This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of different analgesia regimens for esophagectomy, focusing on epidural analgesia (EA) and paravertebral block (PVB) as alternatives to opioid-based systemic analgesia.\n\nMethods: A randomised controlled trial was conducted with participants undergoing esophagectomy. Eligibility criteria included adult patients scheduled for minimally invasive esophagectomy. The study was conducted in a tertiary care hospital. Participants were randomised to receive either EA or PVB. Randomisation was performed using a computer-generated sequence, and allocation was concealed using sealed envelopes. Blinding was applied to outcome assessors.\n\nObjective: To compare the effectiveness of EA and PVB in reducing postoperative pain and complications.\n\nOutcome: The primary outcome was postoperative pain measured by the Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) over 48 hours.\n\nResults: A total of 200 participants were randomised: 100 to the EA group and 100 to the PVB group. Analysis was conducted on 98 participants in the EA group and 97 in the PVB group using an intention-to-treat approach. The mean difference in NRS scores was 0.89 (95% CI: −0.47 to 2.24; p = 0.21). Adverse events included hypotension and urinary retention in the EA group (3%) and none in the PVB group.\n\nTrial registration: NCT12345678\n\nFunding: This trial was funded by the National Institute of Health.",
