ANG-3777, a hepatocyte growth factor mimetic, may improve outcomes by binding to the c-MET receptor.\n\nMethods: This multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 2 trial enrolled patients with <50 cc/h urine output for 8 consecutive hours or creatinine reduction ratio <30% within 24 hours posttransplantation. Participants were randomized 2:1 to receive ANG-3777 (2 mg/kg, n=19) or placebo (n=9) via three once-daily IV infusions. The primary outcome was time to achieve ≥1200 cc urine output over 24 hours within 28 days. Randomization was computer-generated, and allocation was concealed. Patients, clinicians, and outcome assessors were blinded.\n\nResults: By day 28, 83.3% of ANG-3777 patients achieved the primary outcome versus 50% in placebo (log-rank test: χ²=2.799, P=0.09). ANG-3777 patients had greater urine output, lower serum creatinine, reduced inflammation markers, fewer dialysis sessions, shorter hospital stays, less graft failure, and higher eGFR. Adverse events were similar between groups, but events per subject were higher in placebo.\n\nInterpretation: ANG-3777 showed an efficacy signal for improved renal function with a favorable safety profile. Further trials are warranted.\n\nTrial registration: N/A\n\nFunding: Not specified",
