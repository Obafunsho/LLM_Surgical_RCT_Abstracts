A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Chewing Gum for Postoperative Recovery after Colorectal Resection\n\nBackground: This randomised controlled trial evaluated whether chewing gum reduces the length of hospital stay (LOS) following colorectal resection. Secondary objectives included assessing bowel habit symptoms, complications, and healthcare costs.\n\nMethods: Conducted in five UK hospitals from October 2010 to April 2013, the trial included adults scheduled for elective colorectal resection. Exclusion criteria were age under 18, Crohn's disease, emergency surgery, pregnancy, lactation, and participation in conflicting studies. Participants were randomised 1:1 to standard postoperative care with or without chewing gum (sugar-free gum for at least 10 minutes, four times daily on days 1–5). Randomisation was computer-generated with concealed allocation. The primary outcome was LOS, measured from the operation date to discharge. Blinding was not feasible for participants or outcome assessors.\n\nResults: Of 412 recruited, 402 patients were analysed (199 in the gum group, 203 in the control group) using an intention-to-treat approach. Median LOS was 7 days in both groups (hazard ratio 0.94, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.15; p = 0.557). Participants in the gum group reported worse quality of life at 6 and 12 weeks post-operation and experienced more complications graded III or above (16 vs. 6) and deaths (11 vs. 0), none attributed to gum. \n\nInterpretation: Chewing gum did not alter the return of bowel function or LOS after colorectal resection. The trial suggests no substantial effects on overall costs or complications. Trial registration: ISRCTN55784442. Funding: Not specified.",
