A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial on Obstructive Sleep Apnea in Atrial Fibrillation Patients\n\nBackground: Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is prevalent in atrial fibrillation (AF) patients, yet underdiagnosed. This study aims to evaluate OSA prevalence and diagnostic strategies in AF populations.\n\nMethods: This randomised controlled trial was conducted in cardiology units, enrolling adult AF patients. Participants were randomly assigned to either polysomnography (PSG) or home sleep apnea testing (HSAT) for OSA diagnosis. The primary outcome was OSA prevalence, measured over a 12-month period. Randomisation was computer-generated, with allocation concealment via sealed envelopes. Blinding was applied to outcome assessors.\n\nResults: A total of 200 participants were randomised: 100 to the PSG group and 100 to the HSAT group, between January 2020 and June 2021. Analysis included 98 participants in the PSG group and 97 in the HSAT group, using an intention-to-treat approach. OSA prevalence was 65% in the PSG group and 60% in the HSAT group (mean difference = 5%, 95% CI -5% to 15%; p = 0.30). No adverse events were reported in either group.\n\nInterpretation: The study highlights a high prevalence of OSA in AF patients, with no significant difference between diagnostic methods. Structured screening protocols and interdisciplinary collaboration are essential for improving OSA detection and management in AF care.\n\nTrial registration: NCT12345678\n\nFunding: This trial was funded by the National Heart Institute.",
