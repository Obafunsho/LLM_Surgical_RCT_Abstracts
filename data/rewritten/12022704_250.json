A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial on Blood Transfusion in Total Knee Replacement\n\nBackground: Total knee replacement (TKR) is effective for end-stage knee osteoarthritis but is associated with perioperative blood loss requiring allogenic blood transfusion (ABT). This study aimed to assess the prevalence of ABT and factors influencing transfusion and blood loss.\n\nMethods: This retrospective cross-sectional study was conducted at Hospital Melaka, involving 296 adult patients who underwent elective primary unilateral TKR from January 2015 to December 2019. Eligibility criteria included primary knee osteoarthritis and unilateral TKR. Exclusions were haematological disorders and secondary osteoarthritis. Data on ABT incidence, demographics, antiplatelet/anticoagulant use, tourniquet time, anaesthesia type, and haemoglobin levels were analyzed. The primary outcome was the prevalence of ABT, measured postoperatively.\n\nResults: The prevalence of ABT was 4.39% (95% CI 2.04, 6.74). Pre-operative haemoglobin was the only significant factor associated with ABT (P<0.001; OR=0.35; 95% CI 0.22, 0.54). Prolonged tourniquet time (>120 minutes) significantly increased blood loss, with participants having 2.67 times the odds of >2 g/dL blood loss compared to those with ≤120 minutes (95% CI=1.54, 4.64).\n\nInterpretation: The prevalence of ABT in our centre was lower than in other studies. Optimising pre-operative haemoglobin levels can reduce ABT need. No adverse events were reported. The study was not registered as a trial and received no specific funding.",
