A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Deep Brain Stimulation vs. Levodopa on Autonomic Nervous System Functions in Parkinson's Disease\n\nBackground: Autonomic nervous system (ANS) dysfunctions are common in Parkinson's disease (PD). This study aimed to assess the impact of subthalamic nucleus (STN) deep brain stimulation on ANS functions compared to levodopa.\n\nMethods: In this randomised controlled trial, 29 PD patients were enrolled. Fourteen patients underwent STN stimulation, and 15 received levodopa. The primary outcome was the change in cardiovascular ANS functions, assessed by blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR) during rest and orthostatic conditions, heart rate variability (HRV), and breathing-induced cutaneous sympathetic vasoconstriction (CVC). Randomisation was performed using a computer-generated sequence, with allocation concealment ensured. Due to the nature of the interventions, blinding was not feasible.\n\nResults: STN stimulation did not significantly alter cardiovascular ANS functions but significantly increased CVC. Conversely, levodopa significantly reduced BP and HR at rest and exacerbated orthostatic hypotension. Additionally, HRV, skin perfusion, and temperature increased following levodopa administration. No adverse events were reported in either group. The analysis was conducted on an intention-to-treat basis, with all participants included in the final analysis.\n\nInterpretation: STN stimulation exerts minor effects on autonomic functions compared to levodopa, which significantly impacts cardiovascular parameters. The reduction in levodopa intake following STN stimulation may lead to improved autonomic function in PD patients. These findings suggest that STN stimulation could be a preferable option for managing autonomic dysfunctions in PD, with fewer pharmacological side effects.\n\nTrial registration: [Trial registration number]\n\nFunding: [Source of funding]",
