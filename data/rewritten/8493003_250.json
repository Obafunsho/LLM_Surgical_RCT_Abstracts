A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Preoperative Breast MRI in Breast Cancer: A Randomised Controlled Trial\n\nBackground: The impact of preoperative breast MRI on disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) in breast cancer patients remains unclear. This study evaluates the long-term outcomes of preoperative MRI compared to conventional imaging.\n\nMethods: This randomised multicentre trial included 440 patients aged 56 years or less with newly diagnosed breast cancer, conducted at three breast cancer units. Participants were randomised to preoperative MRI (n=220) or conventional imaging (n=220) between 2007 and 2010. The primary outcome was DFS, measured over a 10-year follow-up. Randomisation was computer-generated, and allocation was concealed. Blinding was not applicable.\n\nResults: After 10 years, DFS rates were 85.5% in the MRI group and 80.0% in the control group (HR 1.46, 95% CI 0.93 to 2.29; P=0.099). OS rates were 90.9% for MRI and 88.6% for control (HR 1.27, 95% CI 0.71 to 2.29; P=0.427). Combined recurrence outcomes were higher in the control group (P=0.048). Subgroup analysis for stages I–III showed improved DFS with MRI, but not statistically significant (P=0.057). No adverse events were reported.\n\nTrial registration: NCT01859936\n\nFunding: Supported by Capio St Goran’s Hospital Research Foundation, Centre for Clinical Research, Vastmanland Hospital, Percy Falk Foundation, and Vastmanland Research Foundation against Cancer.",
