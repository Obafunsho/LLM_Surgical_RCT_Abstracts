This study evaluates neoadjuvant chemotherapy (nCT) as an alternative in lower-risk locally advanced rectal cancer (LARC) with uninvolved mesorectal fascia (MRF).\n\nMethods: In this phase III, open-label, multicenter trial, 663 patients with LARC within 12 cm from the anal verge and uninvolved MRF were randomised to nCT (4 cycles of CAPOX) or nCRT (capecitabine with 50 Gy radiation). The primary endpoint was 3-year local-regional failure-free survival. Randomisation was stratified by tumor location and nodal staging, with allocation concealment via central randomisation. Outcome assessors were blinded.\n\nResults: From June 2014 to October 2020, 589 patients received treatment (nCT: 300, nCRT: 289). Pathologic complete response (pCR) rates were 11.0% (95% CI, 7.8-15.3%) for nCT and 13.8% (95% CI, 10.1-18.5%) for nCRT (p=0.33). Downstaging rates were 40.8% for nCT and 45.6% for nCRT (p=0.27). nCT showed lower perioperative metastasis (0.7% vs. 3.1%, p=0.03) and ileostomy rates (52.2% vs. 63.6%, p=0.008). Adverse events were similar between groups.\n\nInterpretation: nCT with CAPOX offers comparable pCR and downstaging rates to nCRT, with reduced perioperative metastasis and ileostomy rates. Long-term follow-up is needed. Trial registration: NCT02288195. Funding: Not specified.",
