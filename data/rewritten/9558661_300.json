The primary outcome was oropharyngeal leak pressure (OLP) measured immediately after insertion and 30 minutes during carboperitonium. Secondary outcomes included device insertion time, ease of insertion, changes in peak airway pressure, heart rate, mean arterial pressure, and airway complications. Randomisation was achieved using closed sealed envelopes, and allocation was concealed. The study was not blinded.\n\nResults: OLP was significantly higher in the Baska mask group (31.61 ± 4.3 cmH2O) compared to the i-gel (28.27 ± 3.4 cmH2O) and LMA-S (29.42 ± 3.9 cmH2O) groups (p = 0.005). No significant differences were found in device insertion time, number of attempts, or ease of insertion. Gastric tube insertion time was significantly lower in the Baska mask group (9.59 ± 2.78 s) compared to the i-gel (12.79 ± 3.47 s) and LMA-S (10.84 ± 3.68 s) groups (p < 0.05). No significant differences in peak airway pressure, heart rate, mean arterial pressure, or complications were observed. Adverse events such as sore throat, dysphagia, and dysphonia were similar across groups.\n\nInterpretation: The Baska mask demonstrated superior OLP without significant airway morbidity, suggesting it as a preferable alternative for laparoscopic cholecystectomy.\n\nTrial registration: Not provided.\n\nFunding: None.",
