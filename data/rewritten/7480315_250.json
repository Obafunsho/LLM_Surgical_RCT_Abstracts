Randomisation was done using a computer-generated sequence with allocation concealment via sequentially numbered opaque envelopes. The primary outcome was the requirement of morphine, isoflurane, and vecuronium, measured intra-operatively. Secondary outcomes included blood glucose and serum cortisol levels measured at baseline, post-incision, and post-operatively. Blinding was not possible due to the nature of the intervention.\n\nResults: Fifteen patients were randomised to each group, with 14 in Group E and 15 in Group G completing the study. Group E showed a significant reduction in morphine (p < 0.001), isoflurane (p = 0.004), and vecuronium (p = 0.001) requirements. Post-operative blood glucose and serum cortisol levels were significantly lower in Group E (p = 0.0153 and p = 0.0074, respectively). Adverse events included bradycardia in 6.6% and hypotension in 13.3% of Group E.\n\nInterpretation: Cervical epidural analgesia combined with general anesthesia reduces opioid and anesthetic requirements and stress response compared to general anesthesia alone in head and neck cancer surgery.\n\nTrial registration: Not provided.\n\nFunding: No financial support was reported.",
