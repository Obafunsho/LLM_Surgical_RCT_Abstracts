This study aimed to determine the median effective dose (ED50) and effective dose 95% (ED95) of nalbuphine for alleviating moderate-severe CRBD.\n\nMethods: This retrospective study analyzed anesthesia records of male patients who underwent URL under general anesthesia at Jiaxing University Affiliated Hospital between August 2023 and August 2024. Patients were categorized into four groups based on nalbuphine dosage: 0.025, 0.05, 0.075, and 0.10 mg/kg. The primary outcome was the CRBD score measured 5 minutes after laryngeal mask removal. Probit regression analysis was used to calculate ED50 and ED95. Hemodynamic parameters and adverse events were also documented.\n\nResults: Data from 76 patients were analyzed. CRBD, agitation, and urinary catheter-related pain scores decreased with increasing nalbuphine doses, while Ramsay sedation scores increased. No significant differences were observed in hemodynamic parameters or adverse effects across dose groups. The ED50 of nalbuphine was 0.03 mg/kg (95% CI: 0.013–0.046), and the ED95 was 0.108 mg/kg (95% CI: 0.085–0.188). No significant adverse events were reported.\n\nInterpretation: Nalbuphine is a safe and effective agent for mitigating CRBD in male patients undergoing URL, with an ED50 of 0.03 mg/kg and ED95 of 0.108 mg/kg. The study was not registered, and funding sources were not disclosed. Future studies should include larger, more diverse populations and multicenter cohorts to enhance generalizability.",
