Participants were randomised 1:1 to either perioperative systemic therapy or CRS–HIPEC alone. Randomisation was stratified by previous systemic therapy, onset of peritoneal metastases, peritoneal cancer index, and planned HIPEC regimen. PROs were assessed using EORTC QLQ-C30, QLQ-CR29, and EQ-5D-5L questionnaires at baseline, after neoadjuvant treatment, and at 3 and 6 months postoperatively. Linear mixed modeling was used for analysis.\n\nResults: Between June 2017 and January 2019, 80 patients were randomised, with 40 in each group. In the modified intention-to-treat analysis, 37 patients received perioperative systemic therapy and 42 underwent upfront surgery. All predefined PROs were comparable between arms at all timepoints and returned to baseline at 3 or 6 months postoperatively. The experimental arm showed worsening of fatigue (MD +14, p = 0.001), loss of appetite (MD +15, p = 0.003), hair loss (MD +18, p < 0.001), and loss of taste (MD +27, p < 0.001) after neoadjuvant treatment, with most returning to baseline postoperatively.\n\nInterpretation: PROs were comparable between treatment arms, supporting the tolerability of perioperative systemic therapy.
