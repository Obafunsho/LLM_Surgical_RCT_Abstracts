A 300-word version\n\nTitle: A Randomised Controlled Trial Comparing Standard and Long Intramedullary Hip Nails for Reverse Obliquity Fractures\n\nBackground: Reverse obliquity fractures of the proximal femur are biomechanically distinct and have high implant failure rates with sliding hip screws. Intramedullary hip nailing may reduce lag screw cut-out risk, but the effect of nail length on healing remains uncertain.\n\nMethods: This pilot prospective randomised controlled trial was conducted from January 2009 to December 2009 at a single institution. Participants were patients aged 67-95 years with reverse obliquity fractures of the proximal femur. Patients were randomised to receive either standard or long (≥34 cm) intramedullary hip nails. The primary outcome was reoperation rate due to fixation failure, assessed over a minimum follow-up of 12 months. Randomisation was performed using a computer-generated sequence, with allocation concealment ensured by sealed envelopes. Blinding was not applied to patients or clinicians.\n\nResults: Thirty-three patients were randomised: 15 to standard nails and 18 to long nails. Analysis was conducted per-protocol. Reoperation rates showed no significant difference between groups. Two patients in the long-nail group required revision surgery due to implant failure and deep infection. Mortality rates were 17% for standard nails and 18% for long nails. Parker-Palmer mobility scores were five for standard nails and six for long nails, while Harris hip scores were 74 and 79, respectively. Union rates were 100% in both groups, with similar adverse events.\n\nInterpretation: Both standard and long intramedullary nails are effective for treating reverse obliquity fractures, with no significant differences in reoperation rates or functional outcomes. These findings suggest that nail length may not significantly impact healing, but further research is warranted.\n\nTrial registration: Not provided.\n\nFunding: Not disclosed.",
