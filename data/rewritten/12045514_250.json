A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Early Peritoneal Dialysis in Newborns Post-Cardiac Surgery: A Retrospective Cohort Study\n\nBackground: This study evaluates a clinical strategy for early peritoneal dialysis (PD) initiation in newborns at high risk of cardiac surgery-associated acute kidney injury (CSA-AKI) following cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB).\n\nMethods: This retrospective single-center study was conducted at the Children's Hospital of Mississippi, involving 49 newborns who underwent congenital heart surgery between January 2012 and December 2015. PD catheters were placed in the operating room post-CPB. Newborns with prolonged CPB times (>180 minutes), postoperative oligoanuria, and/or inability to achieve negative fluid balance within 24 hours were selected for early PD (PD [+]). The primary outcomes were 5% fluid accumulation at 48 hours and severe AKI on postoperative day (POD) 5.\n\nResults: Of the 49 newborns, 29 were initiated on early PD, while 20 used the PD catheter as an abdominal drain. Both groups were oliguric during the first 8 hours postoperatively. The early PD group had significantly less urine output on POD 1 (0.98 vs. 3.02 ml/kg per hour; P = 0.001). At 48 hours, the prevalence of 5% fluid accumulation was similar between groups. Severe AKI incidence on POD 5 was also similar. Time to extubation was longer for the early PD group (10.0 vs. 4.0 days; P = 0.017).\n\nInterpretation: Persistent oliguria and inability to achieve negative fluid balance within 24 hours postoperatively may identify newborns who benefit from early PD. The first 8 hours postoperatively were not discriminative for this strategy.",
