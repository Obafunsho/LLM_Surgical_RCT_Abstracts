A 250-word version\n\nTitle: A Randomised Controlled Trial of Ketamine and Nefopam for Potentiating Opioid Analgesia\n\nBackground: This study aimed to compare the efficacy and safety of ketamine and nefopam in potentiating opioid analgesia.\n\nMethods: This randomised controlled trial was conducted at [Study Setting]. Participants were adults eligible for opioid analgesia. A total of 200 participants were randomised: 100 to receive ketamine 10 mg and 100 to receive nefopam 20 mg. Randomisation was performed using a computer-generated sequence with allocation concealment via sealed envelopes. Both patients and outcome assessors were blinded. The primary outcome was the reduction in opioid requirement over 24 hours. Analysis was conducted on an intention-to-treat basis.\n\nResults: Both ketamine and nefopam reduced opioid requirements by approximately 40% (mean difference = [value], 95% CI [range]; p = [value]). Sedation was observed in the ketamine group, while tachycardia and sweating were noted in the nefopam group. Adverse events were not serious, with 5/100 (5%) in the ketamine group and 7/100 (7%) in the nefopam group experiencing mild side effects.\n\nInterpretation: Ketamine and nefopam comparably potentiate opioid analgesia, each reducing opioid need by approximately 40%. Both drugs are associated with mild adverse effects, with ketamine causing sedation and nefopam causing tachycardia and sweating. Either drug can be used to enhance opioid analgesia.\n\nTrial registration: [Trial Registration Number]\n\nFunding: This study was funded by [Funding Source].",
