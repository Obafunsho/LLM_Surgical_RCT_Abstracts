A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Bilateral Remote Ischemic Conditioning in Children: A Randomised Controlled Trial\n\nBackground: The objective was to assess whether bilateral remote ischemic preconditioning (RIPC) offers cardioprotection in children undergoing surgery for tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) or ventricular septal defect (VSD).\n\nMethods: This double-blind, randomised controlled trial was conducted at Birmingham and Leeds Children's Hospitals, UK. A total of 120 children aged 3 to 36 months were randomised 1:1 to receive RIPC or a sham procedure. The primary outcome was the area under the curve (AUC) for high-sensitivity troponin-T in the first 24 hours post-surgery, analysed by intention-to-treat. Randomisation was performed using a secure online system with allocation concealment, and blinding was maintained for patients, clinicians, and outcome assessors.\n\nResults: Between October 2016 and December 2020, 120 children were randomised: 60 to RIPC and 60 to control. The primary outcome showed a higher AUC for troponin-T in the RIPC group (mean: 70.0 ± 50.9 μg/L/h) compared to controls (mean: 55.6 ± 30.1 μg/L/h) with a mean difference of 13.2 μg/L/h (95% CI, 0.5-25.8; P = .04). Subgroup analyses indicated no differential effect by oxygen saturations but suggested potential harm in unstented TOF (p interaction = .04). Secondary outcomes and myocardial metabolism were not significantly different between groups. Adverse events were similar, with 4 serious events in the RIPC group and 5 in controls, none related to the intervention.\n\nInterpretation: Bilateral RIPC did not attenuate myocardial injury and may be harmful in unstented TOF. Routine use of RIPC is not recommended for myocardial protection in pediatric cardiac surgery.\n\nTrial registration: ISRCTN12923441\n\nFunding: The trial was funded by [source not specified].",
