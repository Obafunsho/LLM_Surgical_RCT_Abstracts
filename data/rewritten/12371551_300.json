A 300-word version\n\nBackground: Traumatic carotid-jugular fistulas (CJFs) are rare and potentially life-threatening vascular injuries that require precise intervention to prevent severe complications. This study aimed to assess the effectiveness of open surgical repair for complex CJFs in resource-limited settings.\n\nMethods: This case report involves a 23-year-old Afghan man who developed a traumatic CJF and right common carotid pseudoaneurysm following a gunshot wound. The patient presented with persistent neck pain and pulsation. Imaging confirmed an aneurysmal dilation and fistulous connection. The intervention consisted of open surgical repair, including resection of the aneurysm and reconstruction of the affected vessels.\n\nResults: The postoperative recovery was successful, with the resolution of symptoms and restoration of normal function. The patient was discharged two days after surgery with improved signs and symptoms. No adverse events were reported during the follow-up period. The case demonstrates the effectiveness of open surgery in managing complex CJFs, especially in resource-limited settings where endovascular interventions may not be feasible.\n\nInterpretation: This case underscores the importance of open surgical repair for complex CJFs, particularly in settings with limited resources. The successful management of this case highlights the need for tailored treatment strategies based on local resource availability and patient-specific factors. Open surgical intervention provides a cost-effective and definitive solution for traumatic CJFs, ensuring long-term stability and function. The study contributes to the limited existing literature on traumatic CJFs and emphasizes the viability of open surgical intervention in resource-limited settings, offering a critical option for managing these complex vascular injuries.",
