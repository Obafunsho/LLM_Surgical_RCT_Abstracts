A 300-word version\n\nTitle: EXPELLIARMUS: A Randomised Controlled Trial\n\nBackground: While early postoperative mobilization is believed to reduce complications, the effectiveness of fitness trackers (FT) alone in achieving this is uncertain.\n\nMethods: This multicenter randomized controlled trial was conducted at 11 university hospitals in Germany. Patients aged ≥18 years undergoing major abdominal surgery were randomly assigned to the experimental group (FT with visible screen and step goals) or control group (FT with blackened screen). The primary outcome was postoperative morbidity within 30 days, measured by the Comprehensive Complication Index (CCI). Randomization was performed using a centralized web-based tool with allocation concealment, and neither patients nor outcome assessors were blinded. A total of 347 patients were recruited between June 2019 and October 2021, with 174 in the experimental group and 173 in the control group. Analysis was conducted on an intention-to-treat basis.\n\nResults: The mean CCI was 23±24 in the experimental group and 22±22 in the control group (95% CI: −6.1, 3.7; P=0.628). Secondary outcomes, including quality of recovery, 6-minute walking test, length of hospital stay, and step count until postoperative day 7, were comparable between groups. Serious adverse events occurred in 20% of the experimental group and 25% of the control group (P=0.237). No imputation for the primary endpoint was necessary as data completeness was 100%.\n\nInterpretation: Daily step goals combined with FT-based feedback did not reduce postoperative morbidity. The EXPELLIARMUS trial demonstrates the feasibility of student-led randomized controlled trials in surgery, providing valuable insights into postoperative mobilization strategies.\n\nTrial registration: DRKS00016755.\n\nFunding: The trial was conducted by the Student-Initiated German Medical Audit (SIGMA) study group, supported by the German Society of Surgery's CHIR-Net.",
