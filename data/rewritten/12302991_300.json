Participants were categorized into two cohorts based on the presence or absence of postoperative AKI within 30 days. The primary outcome was the 36-month cumulative incidence of CKD. We employed univariate and multivariate analyses to evaluate the time to CKD development.\n\nResults: Out of 378 patients, 51 (13.5%) developed postoperative AKI. Over a median follow-up of 19.4 months, patients with AKI were twice as likely to develop CKD (p<0.001). The cumulative incidence of CKD at 36 months was 23.4%. Univariate analysis showed that AKI was associated with CKD (HR=2.17, 95% CI 1.22–3.84), but this association was not significant in multivariate analysis. Factors such as older age, body mass index ≥30 kg/m², hypertension, higher preoperative creatinine, and neoadjuvant chemotherapy were significantly associated with CKD.\n\nInterpretation: The study found no significant association between postoperative AKI and long-term CKD or cardiac conditions after open ERAS surgery for gynecologic malignancies. Other factors, including age and preoperative health status, appear more influential in CKD development. The study did not provide details on trial registration, randomization, blinding, or funding sources. Further research is needed to explore these associations in more detail.",
