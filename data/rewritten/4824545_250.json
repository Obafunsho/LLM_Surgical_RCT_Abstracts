This study aimed to evaluate the effects of preoperative midazolam on postoperative sleep in children undergoing tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy.\n\nMethods: This two-group randomised controlled trial was conducted at Yale-New Haven Children’s Hospital. Seventy children aged 3 to 12 years were randomly assigned to receive either preoperative acetaminophen only (control group, n = 32) or both acetaminophen and midazolam (experimental group, n = 38). Randomisation was performed using a computer-generated sequence, and allocation was concealed. Parents assessed postoperative behavioral recovery, and a subset of children wore actigraphs to measure sleep objectively. Blinding was applied to outcome assessors.\n\nResults: The primary outcome was postoperative sleep, measured using actigraphy. Children in the midazolam group were awake significantly less during the night compared to the control group (p = 0.01). No significant adverse events were reported in either group.\n\nInterpretation: Preoperative midazolam administration resulted in improved postoperative sleep in children, as evidenced by reduced nighttime awakenings. These findings suggest that midazolam may be beneficial for enhancing postoperative recovery in pediatric patients. Further research is needed to explore the broader behavioral effects of midazolam.\n\nTrial registration: [Trial registration number]\n\nFunding: [Source of funding]",
