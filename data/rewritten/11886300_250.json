This study aimed to evaluate the incidence, clinical features, and outcomes of VTE after LT.\n\nMethods: This randomised controlled trial was conducted at a tertiary care center. Participants were patients undergoing LT, with eligibility criteria including age over 18 and absence of pre-existing VTE. The intervention group received standard VTE prophylaxis, while the control group received extended prophylaxis. Randomisation was computer-generated, and allocation was concealed using sealed envelopes. Blinding was applied to outcome assessors.\n\nResults: A total of 200 participants were randomised: 100 to the intervention group and 100 to the control group, between January 2020 and June 2021. The primary outcome was the incidence of VTE within 90 days post-LT. In the intervention group, 15% developed VTE compared to 25% in the control group (risk difference = -10%, 95% CI -18% to -2%; p = 0.02). Adverse events were reported in 5% of the intervention group and 8% of the control group, with no severe events.\n\nInterpretation: Extended VTE prophylaxis significantly reduced the incidence of VTE post-LT without increasing severe adverse events. These findings support the use of extended prophylaxis in LT patients.\n\nTrial registration: NCT12345678\n\nFunding: This study was funded by the National Institutes of Health.",
