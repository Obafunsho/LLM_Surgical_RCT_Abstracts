A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Quantitative EEG in Delirium Subtypes\n\nBackground: Delirium, an acute encephalopathy with heterogeneous etiology, poses significant clinical challenges. This study aimed to determine if quantitative electroencephalography (qEEG) characteristics differ among etiology-based delirium subtypes or converge on common neurophysiological patterns.\n\nMethods: This multicenter observational study analyzed qEEG data from 377 patients (173 delirious, 204 non-delirious) across three sites. Participants were assigned to post-stroke, medical, or postoperative delirium subtypes based on DSM-IV or DSM-5 criteria. We compared peak frequency, relative power, and phase lag index (PLI) between delirious and non-delirious patients using standardized mean differences (SMDs) with 95% confidence intervals (CI).\n\nResults: Spectral qEEG measures showed no differences between subgroups. Peak frequency consistently decreased in all delirium groups compared to controls (SMD = -0.81, CI: -1.50 to -0.13), relative delta power increased (SMD = 1.44, CI: 0.61 to 2.26), and relative beta power decreased (SMD = -1.72, CI: -2.46 to -0.97). PLI differences were small and inconsistent across subtypes.\n\nInterpretation: The study demonstrates consistent spectral qEEG patterns across delirium subtypes, suggesting a common neurophysiological pathway of global EEG slowing. PLI differences did not converge across subtypes. Harmonized multicenter studies are needed to further understand shared and distinct neurophysiological changes in delirium.\n\nFunding: The study was funded by institutional resources.",
