A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Network Meta-Analysis of Randomised Controlled Trials for Endovascular Treatments in Superficial Femoral Artery Disease\n\nBackground: This study aimed to compare the safety and efficacy of various endovascular treatments for superficial femoral artery (SFA) disease through a network meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials.\n\nMethods: A systematic literature search of PubMed from January 2000 to January 2023 identified randomised trials comparing endovascular interventions for SFA disease. The primary outcomes were technical success and 12-month primary patency. The study included 57 trials with 9089 patients. Randomisation methods and allocation concealment were not specified. Blinding details were not provided.\n\nResults: Technical success was superior for covered stent graft (CSG), bare metal stent (BMS), and atherectomy plus drug-coated balloon (A+DCB) compared with percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA). All interventions except brachytherapy alone had superior primary patency compared with PTA. There were no significant differences in 12-month mortality or major amputation. Adverse events were not reported. The analysis was conducted using an intention-to-treat approach.\n\nInterpretation: PTA alone is mostly inferior to other endovascular techniques for SFA disease. This comparison will aid in endovascular device selection for treating SFA disease.\n\nTrial registration: PROSPERO CRD42022377373.\n\nFunding: Not specified.",
