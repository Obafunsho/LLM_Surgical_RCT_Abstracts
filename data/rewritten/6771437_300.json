A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial on Time to Hemostasis in Bleeding Trauma Patients\n\nBackground: Timely hemostasis is vital in managing bleeding trauma patients, yet its impact on clinical outcomes is underreported. This study investigates the association between time to hemostasis and patient outcomes.\n\nMethods: This randomised controlled trial utilized data from the PROPPR trial, conducted at multiple trauma centers. Eligible participants were those undergoing emergent procedures within 90 minutes. Hemostasis was defined as no intraoperative bleeding requiring intervention or resolution of contrast blush. The primary outcome was 30-day mortality, with secondary outcomes including acute kidney injury (AKI), acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), multiple organ failure (MOF), sepsis, and venous thromboembolism (VTE). Randomisation and allocation concealment methods were not specified. Blinding details were not provided.\n\nResults: Of 680 enrolled patients, 468 underwent emergent procedures. In 408 patients achieving hemostasis, every 15-minute reduction in time to hemostasis was linked to decreased 30-day mortality (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.94–0.99), AKI (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.96–0.98), ARDS (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.97–0.99), MOF (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.91–0.97), and sepsis (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.96–0.99), but not VTE (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.96–1.03). Analysis was conducted per-protocol.\n\nInterpretation: Reduced time to hemostasis is independently associated with improved outcomes, including lower mortality and morbidity, in bleeding trauma patients. These findings suggest that time to hemostasis should be considered a critical endpoint in trauma research. Trial registration and funding information were not provided.",
