A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial on Time to Hemostasis in Bleeding Trauma Patients\n\nBackground: Faster time to hemostasis is crucial in bleeding trauma patients, yet often underreported. This study evaluates the impact of time to hemostasis on clinical outcomes.\n\nMethods: This randomised controlled trial analyzed data from the PROPPR trial, conducted across multiple trauma centers. Participants included patients undergoing emergent procedures within 90 minutes. Hemostasis was defined as no intraoperative bleeding requiring intervention or resolution of contrast blush. The primary outcome was 30-day mortality, with secondary outcomes including acute kidney injury (AKI), acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), multiple organ failure (MOF), sepsis, and venous thromboembolism (VTE). Randomisation and allocation concealment methods were not specified. Blinding details were not provided.\n\nResults: Of 680 patients, 468 underwent emergent procedures. In 408 patients achieving hemostasis, every 15-minute decrease in time to hemostasis was associated with reduced 30-day mortality (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.94–0.99), AKI (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.96–0.98), ARDS (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.97–0.99), MOF (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.91–0.97), and sepsis (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.96–0.99), but not VTE (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.96–1.03). Analysis was per-protocol.\n\nInterpretation: Earlier hemostasis is associated with improved outcomes in bleeding trauma patients. Time to hemostasis should be a key endpoint in trauma studies. Trial registration and funding details were not provided.",
