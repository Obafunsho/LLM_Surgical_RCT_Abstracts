A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Hyperthermia as an Adjunct to Immunotherapy in Cancer Treatment\n\nBackground: Immunotherapies have transformed cancer treatment by targeting malignancies through the immune system. Hyperthermia (HT) has emerged as a promising adjunctive treatment to enhance the efficacy of radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and immunotherapy.\n\nMethods: This randomised controlled trial was conducted to evaluate the effects of HT on immune response and tumor microenvironment modulation. Participants were eligible if they had resistant tumors and were recruited from a single oncology center. The intervention group received HT combined with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), while the control group received ICIs alone. Randomisation was performed using a computer-generated sequence with allocation concealment. Blinding was applied to outcome assessors.\n\nResults: A total of 200 participants were randomised, with 100 in each group, between January 2020 and June 2021. The primary outcome was the transformation of \"cold\" tumors into \"hot\" tumors, measured over six months. In the intervention group, 98 participants were analysed using an intention-to-treat approach, showing a significant increase in immune cell infiltration and antigen presentation (mean difference = 5.2, 95% CI 3.1 to 7.3; p = 0.01). Adverse events were mild, with 3% in the intervention group and 1% in the control group experiencing gastrointestinal side-effects.\n\nInterpretation: HT significantly enhances the efficacy of ICIs by modulating the tumor microenvironment and promoting immune-mediated tumor destruction. Further research is needed to optimize treatment protocols and identify biomarkers for patient stratification.\n\nTrial registration: NCT12345678\n\nFunding: This trial was funded by the National Cancer Institute.",
