Participants were randomised to TAI or SOC. The primary outcome was the change in LARS score at 3 months. Randomisation was performed using a computer-generated sequence, and allocation was not concealed. Blinding was not applied.\n\nResults: A total of 32 patients were randomised (16 to TAI, 16 to SOC) between January 2020 and June 2021. One patient from each group was excluded, leaving 15 analysed per group. The mean LARS score decreased significantly more in the TAI group (p = 0.008). Seventeen adverse events occurred in 14 patients, with none severe. Five patients in the TAI group experienced irrigation-related pain or spasms.\n\nInterpretation: TAI with a cone catheter significantly improved LARS scores compared to SOC, with manageable adverse events. Further studies are needed to confirm long-term efficacy.\n\nTrial registration: NCT12345678\n\nFunding: Supported by Coloplast, Humlebaek, Denmark.",
