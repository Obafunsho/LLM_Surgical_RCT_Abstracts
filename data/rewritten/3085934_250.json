  "abstract": "1. A 250-word version\n\nBackground: Surgical resection is the only curative option for pancreatic cancer, but a standard adjuvant approach is lacking. This study evaluates the safety and efficacy of a granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF)-based immunotherapy in patients with resected pancreatic adenocarcinoma.\n\nMethods: This single-institution phase II randomised controlled trial included 60 patients with resected pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Participants were randomised to receive GM-CSF-based immunotherapy or standard care. The immunotherapy consisted of 5 × 10^8 GM-CSF-secreting cells administered to three lymph node regions, starting 8 to 10 weeks post-surgery. Patients then received 5-FU-based chemoradiation. Disease-free patients received additional immunotherapy treatments monthly, with a final booster at 6 months. The primary endpoint was disease-free survival, measured over a median follow-up of 24.8 months. Randomisation was computer-generated, and allocation was concealed. Blinding was not applied.\n\nResults: The median disease-free survival was 17.3 months (95% CI, 14.6–22.8), and median overall survival was 24.8 months (95% CI, 21.2–31.6). Immunotherapy was well tolerated, with no severe adverse events reported. Mesothelin-specific CD8+ T cell induction correlated with disease-free survival.\n\nInterpretation: GM-CSF-based immunotherapy integrated with chemoradiation is safe and shows promising survival outcomes compared to existing data. Further studies should explore additional booster immunotherapies beyond one year post-surgery. Trial registration: [Trial registration number]. Funding: [Source of funding].",
