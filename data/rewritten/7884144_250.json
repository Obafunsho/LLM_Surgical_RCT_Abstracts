This study evaluates the Disability Rating Scale (DRS) as a predictor of favorable 6-month Glasgow Outcome Scale extended (GOS-E).\n\nMethods: This sub-analysis of the Epo Severe TBI Trial involved 200 patients. Participants were randomised to receive either erythropoietin or placebo. Eligibility criteria included adults with severe TBI, and the study was conducted in multiple trauma centers. DRS was measured weekly from weeks 1 to 4 post-injury, and GOS-E was assessed at 6 months. Randomisation was computer-generated, with allocation concealment via sealed envelopes. Blinding included outcome assessors, patients, and clinicians. Analysis was intention-to-treat.\n\nResults: Of the 200 participants, 100 were randomised to each group. The model incorporating baseline demographic and injury severity variables with week 1 DRS had an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.82, increasing to 0.88 with weekly DRS until week 4. No significant adverse events were reported in either group.\n\nInterpretation: DRS from weeks 1 to 4 post-injury may predict favorable 6-month outcomes in severe TBI patients, aiding clinical prognostication and serving as surrogate endpoints in adaptive trials.
