Participants were eligible if they met [Eligibility Criteria]. A total of [Number] participants were randomised using [Randomisation Method] with allocation concealment via [Concealment Method]. The intervention group received [Intervention Details], while the control group received [Control Details]. The primary outcome was [Primary Outcome], measured over [Timeframe]. Blinding was maintained for [Blinded Parties].\n\nResults: [Number] participants were randomised: [Number] to the intervention group and [Number] to the control group, between [Recruitment Period]. [Number] in the intervention group and [Number] in the control group were analysed using an [Analysis Approach] approach. The intervention group showed a [Effect Size] improvement in [Primary Outcome] compared to the control group (95% CI [Confidence Interval]; p = [p-value]). Adverse events were reported in [Number/Percentage] of the intervention group and [Number/Percentage] of the control group, with [Severity and Frequency].\n\nInterpretation: [Intervention] was [Conclusion on Efficacy] compared to [Control] in improving [Primary Outcome] in patients with [Condition]. Further research is needed to [Future Research Directions].\n\nTrial registration: [Trial Registration Number]\n\nFunding: This trial was funded by [Funding Source].",
