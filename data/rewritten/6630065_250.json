The studies compared compliant and partially/noncompliant patients with imaging surveillance protocols. The primary outcome was the reintervention rate, and the secondary outcome was all-cause mortality, measured over a median follow-up of 31.7 months. The review protocol was registered at PROSPERO (CRD42017080494).\n\nResults: The overall reintervention rate was 5%, with a risk difference (RD) of 4% (95% CI 1% to 7%) favoring partial/noncompliance, implying a number needed to harm of 25 (95% CI 14 to 100). The overall mortality rate was 31%, with a nonsignificant RD of 12% (95% CI −2% to 26%) in favor of partial/noncompliance. Two studies reported that 41% to 53% of reinterventions were due to complications detected through imaging surveillance, while others were detected through patient symptoms.\n\nInterpretation: Compliance with imaging surveillance after EVAR appears to lead to more reinterventions without reducing mortality, suggesting that yearly imaging may not be beneficial for all patients. The study highlights the need for a more tailored approach to post-EVAR surveillance.\n\nTrial registration: PROSPERO CRD42017080494\n\nFunding: Not specified.",
