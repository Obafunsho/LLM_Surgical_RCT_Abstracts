A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Polyethylene Glycol-Coated Haemostatic Patch in Reducing Clinically Relevant Postoperative Pancreatic Fistula\n\nBackground: This trial evaluated the impact of a polyethylene glycol-coated haemostatic patch on the incidence of clinically relevant postoperative pancreatic fistula (CR-POPF) after pancreatoduodenectomy (PD).\n\nMethods: This single-centre, open-label, parallel, two-arm, superiority randomised controlled trial was conducted at Miguel Servet University Hospital, Zaragoza, Spain. Eligible participants were patients aged 18-80 years undergoing PD with pancreatojejunostomy for benign or malignant periampullary tumours. Patients were randomised 1:1 to receive pancreatojejunostomy reinforced with two polyethylene glycol-coated haemostatic patches (patch group) or without reinforcement (control group). The primary outcome was CR-POPF within 90 days, defined as grade B/C according to International Study Group of Pancreatic Surgery criteria. Randomisation was performed using a secure internet-based service with allocation concealment. Data analysis was masked.\n\nResults: From 15 May 2018 to 22 June 2020, 72 patients were randomised, and 64 were analysed (31 in the patch group and 33 in the control group). The risk of CR-POPF was reduced by 90% (OR 0.10, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.89, P = 0.039). The patch retained its protective effect in a multivariable regression model, reducing CR-POPF risk by 93% (OR 0.07, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.67, P = 0.021). One patient died in the patch group versus three in the control group.\n\nInterpretation: The polyethylene glycol-coated haemostatic patch significantly reduced CR-POPF incidence after PD. \n\nTrial registration: NCT03419676.\n\nFunding: Not specified.",
