This study assesses the efficacy of isolated hepatic perfusion (IHP) with melphalan in patients with isolated liver metastases from diverse primary tumors.\n\nMethods: Conducted at a single center, this trial involved 19 patients with unresectable liver metastases from uveal melanoma, neuroendocrine carcinoma, gastrointestinal stromal tumors, hepatocellular carcinoma, and high-grade sarcoma. Eligibility criteria included WHO performance status 0-1 and specific hematological and biochemical parameters. Patients received a 60-min IHP with 200 mg melphalan. The primary outcome was tumor response per RECIST criteria, evaluated over a median follow-up of 74 months. Randomisation and blinding were not applicable as this was a single-arm study.\n\nResults: One patient was excluded due to insufficient liver isolation. Among the 18 patients analyzed, reversible grade 3 or 4 hepatotoxicity occurred in 56%, and veno-occlusive disease in 22%. In the 12 uveal melanoma patients, 33% achieved a partial hepatic response, 50% had stable disease, and 17% were immediately progressive. Median disease-free survival was 6.6 months, and median overall survival was 10.0 months. Among patients with other primary tumors, 50% showed at least partial remission, including one complete remission in a high-grade sarcoma patient.\n\nInterpretation: IHP with melphalan shows promise in treating liver metastases from various primary tumors, though additional or alternative drugs may improve therapeutic outcomes. The study did not include a control group, and no trial registration or funding information was provided. Further research is needed to optimize treatment protocols and evaluate long-term benefits.",
