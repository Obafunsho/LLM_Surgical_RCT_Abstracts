A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Neuroprotective Strategies in Coronary Artery Interventions: A Randomised Controlled Trial\n\nBackground: Neurological complications are a significant concern in coronary artery interventions, including CABG, TECAB, and hybrid revascularization. This study evaluates the efficacy of neuroprotective strategies in reducing these complications.\n\nMethods: In this randomised controlled trial, high-risk patients undergoing coronary interventions were enrolled. The trial was conducted at a tertiary care center. Participants were randomly assigned to receive either pharmacological neuroprotection or standard care. The intervention included barbiturates, volatile anesthetics, lidocaine, NMDA receptor antagonists, magnesium, nimodipine, corticosteroids, and aprotinin. Randomisation was computer-generated, with allocation concealment using sealed envelopes. Outcome assessors were blinded to group assignments.\n\nResults: A total of 200 participants were randomised: 100 to the intervention group and 100 to the control group, from January 2020 to June 2021. The primary outcome was the incidence of neurological complications within 30 days post-surgery. The intervention group experienced a significant reduction in complications compared to the control group (mean difference = 5.2%, 95% CI 3.1 to 7.3; p = 0.01). Analysis was conducted on an intention-to-treat basis, with 98 participants in the intervention group and 97 in the control group. Adverse events were mild, with 3% in the intervention group and 1% in the control group reporting gastrointestinal side-effects.\n\nInterpretation: The study demonstrates that pharmacological neuroprotection effectively reduces neurological complications in coronary interventions. These findings support the integration of neuroprotective strategies in clinical practice to enhance patient outcomes. Trial registration: NCT12345678.
