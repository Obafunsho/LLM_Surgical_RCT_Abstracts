This study evaluates the mechanisms and efficacy of TEAS in this context.\n\nMethods: Conducted at a tertiary care hospital, this randomised controlled trial included adults undergoing surgery who met specific eligibility criteria. Participants were randomly assigned to either the TEAS intervention group or a control group. The primary outcome was the regulation of the neuroendocrine network system, assessed over a 24-hour period post-surgery. Randomisation was computer-generated, with allocation concealment ensured by sealed envelopes. Outcome assessors were blinded to group assignments.\n\nResults: A total of 200 participants were randomised: 100 to the TEAS group and 100 to the control group, between January 2020 and June 2021. Analysis included 98 participants in the TEAS group and 97 in the control group, using an intention-to-treat approach. TEAS significantly improved the primary outcome (mean difference = 5.2, 95% CI 3.1 to 7.3; p = 0.01). Adverse events were mild, with 3% in the TEAS group and 1% in the control group experiencing mild gastrointestinal side-effects.\n\nInterpretation: TEAS demonstrates significant efficacy in regulating the neuroendocrine network system during the perioperative period, providing a safer and more effective treatment alternative. The findings support the integration of TEAS into perioperative care protocols. Trial registration: NCT12345678. Funding: Supported by the National Institutes of Health. Future research should focus on optimizing treatment protocols and exploring additional mechanisms of TEAS to enhance its clinical application.",
