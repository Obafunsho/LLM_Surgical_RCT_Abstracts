This study aims to compare the tissue concentrations of cefazolin achieved through systemic versus regional intraosseous administration.\n\nMethods: This randomised controlled trial was conducted at a single orthopedic center, involving 22 patients undergoing primary TKA. Participants were randomly assigned to two groups: Group 1 (n=11) received 1 g cefazolin systemically 10 minutes before tourniquet inflation, while Group 2 (n=11) received 1 g cefazolin intraosseously in 200 mL of normal saline through a tibial cannula after tourniquet inflation and before skin incision. Subcutaneous fat and femoral bone samples were collected at set intervals during the procedure, and antibiotic concentrations were measured using high-performance liquid chromatography. Randomisation was computer-generated, and allocation was concealed using sealed envelopes. Blinding details were not specified.\n\nResults: The mean tissue concentration of cefazolin in subcutaneous fat was 186 ug/g in the intraosseous group and 11 ug/g in the systemic group. In bone, the mean concentration was 130 ug/g in the intraosseous group and 11 ug/g in the systemic group. These differences were consistent across all sample time points. No adverse events were reported in either group.\n\nInterpretation: Intraosseous administration of cefazolin results in significantly higher tissue concentrations compared to systemic administration, suggesting potential for improved infection prevention. Further studies are required to evaluate its clinical efficacy, particularly against resistant organisms like coagulase-negative staphylococci.
