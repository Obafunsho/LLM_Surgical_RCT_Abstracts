A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial on Risk Factors for Postoperative Chronic Opioid Use\n\nBackground: Chronic opioid use is a significant medical and socioeconomic issue. This study aimed to identify risk factors and develop prediction models for postoperative chronic opioid use (PCOU).\n\nMethods: This retrospective cohort study utilized data from the Korean National Health Insurance Service (NHIS) from January 2008 to December 2018. Participants included 1,108,119 patients aged seven years or older who underwent surgery, survived at least one year, and had no additional surgeries. Logistic regression and machine learning models were developed to identify risk factors for PCOU, defined as having filled 10 or more prescriptions or receiving more than 120 days’ supply between postoperative days 91 and 365. Randomisation was conducted by an NHIS big data system manager. The primary outcome was PCOU incidence.\n\nResults: PCOU occurred in 9308 patients (0.84%). Older age, preoperative history of opioid use, and high in-hospital opioid doses were the most significant predictors. Among the 28 most commonly performed surgical procedures in Korea, lung surgery, general spinal surgery, and total knee arthroplasty were most strongly associated with chronic opioid use.\n\nInterpretation: The gradient boosting model identified older age, longer hospital stay, high in-hospital opioid consumption, and preoperative opioid use as key risk factors for PCOU. These findings can guide personalized opioid prescribing practices to reduce PCOU risk.\n\nTrial registration: Not applicable.\n\nFunding: Not specified.",
