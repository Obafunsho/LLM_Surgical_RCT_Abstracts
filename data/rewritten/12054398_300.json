A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Intrahematomal Alteplase in Patients with Intraventricular Hemorrhage\n\nBackground: This study investigates the impact of intrahematomal alteplase on intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) volume and functional outcomes in patients with spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH).\n\nMethods: Conducted as a post-hoc secondary analysis of the MISTIE-III trial, a multicenter randomised controlled trial, this study included participants with IVH on stability CT scans. The intervention group received minimally invasive surgery plus alteplase (MIS+alteplase), while the control group received standard medical care (SMC). The primary outcome was the change in IVH volume (deltaIVH) from stability CT to end-of-treatment CT. Secondary outcomes included functional outcomes (modified Rankin scale 0–3) and mortality at 365 days. Randomisation was computer-generated, and allocation was concealed. Outcome assessors were blinded to treatment allocation.\n\nResults: Of 499 patients, 310 had IVH on stability scans; 146 received MIS+alteplase and 164 received SMC. The MIS+alteplase group showed a greater reduction in IVH volume (deltaIVH: −2.35 mL vs. −1.15 mL, p=0.02). Multivariable linear regression indicated that MIS+alteplase was associated with greater deltaIVH (beta, −0.80; 95%CI, −1.37 to −0.22; p=0.007). Secondary analysis revealed no significant associations between IVH reduction and functional outcomes (aOR for poor outcome: 1.02; 95%CI 0.96–1.08, p=0.61; aOR for mortality: 0.99; 95%CI 0.92–1.06, p=0.77). Adverse events were not reported.\n\nInterpretation: Intrahematomal alteplase was associated with a small reduction in IVH volume, but this did not result in improved functional outcomes or reduced mortality at 365 days.\n\nTrial registration: [Trial registration number]\n\nFunding: [Source of funding]",
