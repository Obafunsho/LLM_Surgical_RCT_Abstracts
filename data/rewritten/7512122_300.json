A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Early Endovenous Ablation for Venous Leg Ulcers: A Randomised Controlled Trial\n\nBackground: This randomised controlled trial assessed the clinical and cost-effectiveness of early endovenous ablation of superficial venous reflux in patients with venous leg ulceration.\n\nMethods: Conducted in 20 UK hospitals, 450 participants with venous leg ulcers of less than 6 months' duration and superficial venous reflux were randomised 1:1 to early intervention (compression therapy and endovenous ablation within 2 weeks) or deferred intervention (compression therapy with deferred ablation). Randomisation used permuted blocks, and allocation was not concealed. Blinding was not applied to surgeons, participants, or follow-up assessors. The primary outcome was time to first ulcer recurrence, measured over a median follow-up of 1286 days.\n\nResults: Of 450 participants, 224 were randomised to early intervention and 226 to deferred intervention. Analysis included 426 participants whose ulcers healed, using an intention-to-treat approach. No significant difference in time to first ulcer recurrence was observed (HR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.57-1.17; P = .28). However, ulcer recurrence rate was lower in the early-intervention group (0.11 vs. 0.16 per person-year; incidence rate ratio, 0.658; 95% CI, 0.480-0.898; P = .003). Time to ulcer healing was shorter in the early-intervention group (HR, 1.36; 95% CI, 1.12-1.64; P = .002). Early intervention was 91.6% likely to be cost-effective at £20,000 per QALY.\n\nInterpretation: Early endovenous ablation accelerated ulcer healing and reduced recurrence rates, proving cost-effective over 3 years. No significant adverse events were reported. Trial Registration: ISRCTN02335796. Funding: UK National Institute for Health Research.",
