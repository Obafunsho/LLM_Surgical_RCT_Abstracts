This study investigated the effect of remote ischaemic preconditioning (RIPC) on perioperative concentrations of high-sensitive cardiac troponin T (hs-cTnT) and interleukin 6 (IL-6).\n\nMethods: This single-centre, double-blind, randomised controlled trial was conducted at St. Antonius Hospital, Nieuwegein, Netherlands. Adult patients scheduled for elective pancreatic surgery between March 2017 and February 2019 were randomised to receive either RIPC or a sham procedure. The primary endpoint was the maximum postoperative hs-cTnT concentration within 48 hours. Secondary endpoints included postoperative myocardial injury (PMI), defined as an increase of hs-cTnT of at least 14 ng/l above baseline, maximum IL-6 concentration within 48 hours, and postoperative complications within 30 days. Randomisation was performed using a web-based system with allocation concealment, and both patients and outcome assessors were blinded.\n\nResults: Ninety-two patients were randomised (46 RIPC, 46 control), and 90 were included in the final analysis using an intention-to-treat approach. RIPC did not significantly reduce the maximum hs-cTnT concentration (12.6 ng/l RIPC, 16.6 ng/l controls, P = 0.225) or the incidence of PMI (13/45 RIPC, 18/45 controls, P = 0.375). Maximum IL-6 concentrations were 265 pg/ml in RIPC and 385 pg/ml in controls (P = 0.108). Postoperative complications occurred in 23 RIPC and 24 control patients. No RIPC-related adverse events were observed.\n\nInterpretation: RIPC did not reduce the maximum postoperative hs-cTnT concentration, PMI, IL-6 concentrations, or postoperative complications compared to controls. Future studies should focus on patients with significant cardiac disease.\n\nTrial registration: Clinicaltrials.gov identifier NCT03460938.\n\nFunding: Biomarker analysis was funded by Roche Diagnostics, which had no role in the study design, conduct, or manuscript preparation.",
