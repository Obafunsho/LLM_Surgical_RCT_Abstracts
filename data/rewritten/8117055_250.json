Participants included surgeons performing high-risk surgeries and patients aged 60 or older with at least one comorbidity and an oncological or vascular problem. Patients were randomised to receive a question prompt list brochure with 11 questions or usual care. The primary outcome was the frequency of ACP discussions and documentation, measured during audiorecorded preoperative consultations from June 1, 2016, to November 30, 2018. Randomisation was computer-generated, and allocation was concealed. Blinding was not applicable.\n\nResults: A total of 213 patients were randomised: 107 to the intervention and 106 to the control group. Analysis was intention-to-treat. Only 13 consultations included ACP discussions. 141 patients (66%) lacked an advance directive (AD) preoperatively. No significant differences were found in ACP discussions or AD documentation between the intervention (38 [35%]) and control groups (34 [33%]; P = .77). No adverse events were reported.\n\nInterpretation: Despite the perceived importance of preoperative ACP, it is infrequently addressed or documented. The intervention did not significantly increase ACP discussions or AD documentation.\n\nTrial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02623335\n\nFunding: Not specified.",
