Elderly patients (≥65 years) undergoing elective LPD with cis-atracurium were randomised to receive neostigmine reversal or no reversal. The primary outcome was the incidence of atelectasis within the first 3 postoperative days. Secondary outcomes included time to extubation, length of stay in the PACU, and oxygen index (OI) at 2 hours post-extubation. Randomisation was performed using a computer-generated sequence with allocation concealment via sealed envelopes. Outcome assessors were blinded to group allocation.\n\nResults: A total of 501 patients were randomised: 89 to the neostigmine group and 213 to the control group. Analysis was conducted on 302 patients using an intention-to-treat approach. Neostigmine reversal was associated with a lower incidence of atelectasis (OR 0.43, 95% CI 0.24–0.75, p = 0.003), shorter time to extubation (Median [IQR] 20.00 [10.00-32.50] min vs. 25.00 [15.00–41.00] min, p < 0.001), and shorter PACU stay (Median [IQR] 55.00 [45.00-67.50] min vs. 60.00 [50.00–84.00] min, p = 0.013). The OI at 2 hours post-extubation was higher in the neostigmine group (Median [IQR] 339.00 [275.76-453.03] vs. 310.00 [262.31–378.00], p < 0.001). No significant adverse events were reported.\n\nTrial registration: [2022]285.\n\nFunding: Not specified.",
