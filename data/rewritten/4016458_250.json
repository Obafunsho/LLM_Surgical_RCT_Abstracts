The study was conducted at a single orthopedic center. The primary outcome was patient satisfaction, measured at the time of followup and one year later for the web-based group. Randomisation was performed using a computer-generated sequence, and allocation was concealed. Blinding was not applicable.\n\nResults: A total of 229 patients completed the study (111 in the usual-care group, 118 in the web-based group). Satisfaction was higher in the usual-care group (82.0% extremely or very satisfied) compared to the web-based group (75.6%, p < 0.01; OR = 3.95; 95% CI, 1.79–8.76). Preference for followup method was 44% for web-based, 36% for in-person, and 16% had no preference (p = 0.01). No adverse events were reported.\n\nInterpretation: While satisfaction was higher with in-person followup, the web-based method offers cost and time-saving benefits. Further research is needed to balance satisfaction with these benefits.\n\nTrial registration: [Trial registration number]\n\nFunding: [Source of funding]",
