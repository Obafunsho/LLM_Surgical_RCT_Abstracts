A 250-word version\n\nBackground: This study investigates mortality trends and disparities among individuals in the United States affected by both cardiovascular disease (CVD) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).\n\nMethods: A retrospective analysis was conducted using death certificates from the CDC WONDER database for individuals aged 25 and older who died between 1999 and 2020 with both CVD (ICD I00-I99) and COPD (ICD J41-J44). Age-adjusted mortality rates (AAMRs) and annual percent change (APC) were calculated by year, sex, age group, race/ethnicity, geographic region, and urbanization status.\n\nResults: Between 1999 and 2020, there were 3,590,124 reported deaths due to coexisting CVD and COPD, with overall AAMR slightly changing from 82.2 to 81.2 per 100,000 population, and a notable rise from 2018 to 2020 (APC: 5.28; 95% CI: 1.83 to 7.22) coinciding with the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. A similar surge in mortality was observed across multiple demographic subgroups, particularly among older adults. Disparities across age groups, sex, race, and geographic location were also observed in the mortality rates due to CVD and COPD. When analyzed by age group, older adults exhibited the highest AAMR at 824.1. Men had higher AAMRs than women (96.5 vs. 60.7). Ethnoracial analysis showed that non-Hispanic (NH) White individuals had the highest AAMRs (82.0), followed by NH American Indian or Alaska Native (74.5), NH Black (63.6), Hispanic (38.1), and NH Asian or Pacific Islander (25.1) individuals. Additionally, non-metropolitan areas had higher AAMRs compared to metropolitan areas (96.2 vs. 70.9).\n\nInterpretation: The findings suggest that mortality rates for CVD and COPD have increased in recent years, coinciding with the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, which may have exacerbated outcomes in vulnerable populations.",
