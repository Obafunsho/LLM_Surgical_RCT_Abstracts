A 250-word version\n\nTitle: A Randomised Controlled Trial of Continuous Femoral Nerve Block Duration After Total Knee Arthroplasty\n\nBackground: This randomised controlled trial tested whether a 4-day ambulatory continuous femoral nerve block (cFNB) improves outcomes compared to an overnight cFNB following tricompartment total knee arthroplasty.\n\nMethods: Fifty patients were enrolled and received a preoperative cFNB with perineural ropivacaine 0.2% until the morning after surgery. Participants were then randomly assigned to continue ropivacaine or switch to normal saline. The primary outcomes were time to meet three discharge criteria (adequate analgesia, independence from intravenous analgesics, and ambulation of at least 30 m) and ambulatory distance in 6 minutes the afternoon after surgery. Randomisation was computer-generated, and allocation was concealed. Blinding included patients, clinicians, and outcome assessors. \n\nResults: Twenty-five patients were randomised to each group. The 4-day ropivacaine group met discharge criteria in a median of 25 hours (25th–75th percentiles: 21–47) compared to 71 hours (46–89) in the control group (estimated ratio, 0.47; 95% CI, 0.32–0.67; P < 0.001). Ambulation distance was 32 m (17–47) for the ropivacaine group versus 26 m (13–35) for the control (estimated ratio, 1.21; 95% CI, 0.71–1.85; P = 0.42). No significant adverse events were reported.\n\nInterpretation: A 4-day ambulatory cFNB significantly reduced the time to meet discharge criteria but did not increase ambulation distance.
