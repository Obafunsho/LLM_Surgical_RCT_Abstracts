A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Network Meta-Analysis of Randomised Controlled Trials for Endovascular Treatments in Superficial Femoral Artery Disease\n\nBackground: This study aimed to evaluate the relative safety and efficacy of various endovascular treatments for superficial femoral artery (SFA) disease through a network meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials.\n\nMethods: A systematic literature search of PubMed from January 2000 to January 2023 identified randomised trials comparing endovascular interventions for SFA disease. The primary outcomes were technical success and 12-month primary patency. The study included 57 trials with 9089 patients. Randomisation methods and allocation concealment were not specified. Blinding details were not provided. The analysis was conducted using an intention-to-treat approach.\n\nResults: The mean age of patients was 68 years, with 41% having diabetes and 18% having critical limb ischemia. Technical success was superior for covered stent graft (CSG), bare metal stent (BMS), and atherectomy plus drug-coated balloon (A+DCB) compared with percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA). All interventions except brachytherapy alone had superior primary patency compared with PTA. There were no significant differences in 12-month mortality or major amputation. Adverse events were not reported. The study found that all interventions except lithotripsy plus drug-coated balloon (L+DCB), PTA plus atherectomy (PTA+A), and cutting balloon angioplasty (CBA) were superior to PTA regarding target lesion revascularization, while only drug-coated balloon (DCB), drug-eluting stent (DES), and BMS were better than PTA at improving Rutherford classification.\n\nInterpretation: PTA alone is mostly inferior to other endovascular techniques for SFA disease. This comparison will aid in endovascular device selection for treating SFA disease.\n\nTrial registration: PROSPERO CRD42022377373.\n\nFunding: Not specified.",
