A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Carotid Revascularization Endarterectomy versus Stenting Trial (CREST): A Randomised Controlled Trial\n\nBackground: The CREST trial aimed to compare the periprocedural stroke and death (S+D) rates between carotid artery stenting (CAS) and carotid endarterectomy (CEA) in patients with carotid artery stenosis.\n\nMethods: This multicenter randomised controlled trial involved 2,502 patients eligible based on carotid artery stenosis criteria. Participants were randomised to receive either CAS or CEA. The primary outcome was the periprocedural S+D rate, measured over a 30-day period. Randomisation was performed using a computer-generated sequence, with allocation concealment via sealed envelopes. Due to the nature of the procedures, blinding was not feasible.\n\nResults: A total of 1,251 patients were assigned to each treatment group. The analysis followed an intention-to-treat approach. Lesion length and characteristics were significant effect modifiers. For lesions ≥12.85 mm, CAS showed a higher S+D risk compared to CEA (OR = 3.42; 95% CI, 1.19-9.78). Similarly, for sequential or remote lesions, CAS had a higher risk (OR = 9.01; 95% CI: 1.20-67.8). In patients with short, contiguous lesions, CAS had a non-significantly lower S+D risk than CEA (OR = 0.72; 95% CI: 0.21-2.46). Adverse events were more frequent in the CAS group, but specific frequencies and severities were not detailed.\n\nInterpretation: The findings suggest that CAS is associated with a higher S+D risk in patients with longer or complex lesions. However, in the absence of these characteristics, CAS may be as safe as CEA regarding periprocedural S+D risk.\n\nTrial registration: NCT00004732\n\nFunding: This study was funded by the National Institutes of Health.",
