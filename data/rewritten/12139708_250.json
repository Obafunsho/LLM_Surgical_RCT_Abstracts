Eligibility criteria included adults with musculoskeletal trauma. Participants were randomised into two groups: intervention (psychosocial care) and control (standard care). Randomisation was computer-generated, and allocation was concealed using sealed envelopes. Blinding was applied to outcome assessors.\n\nIntervention: The intervention group received psychological first aid, psychoeducation, and social support, while the control group received standard orthopaedic care.\n\nObjective: To assess the effect of psychosocial care on post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms and functional recovery.\n\nOutcome: The primary outcome was the reduction in PTSD symptoms measured over 12 months.\n\nResults: A total of 200 participants were randomised, with 100 in each group. Analysis was conducted on 98 participants in the intervention group and 97 in the control group using an intention-to-treat approach. The intervention group showed a significant reduction in PTSD symptoms (mean difference = 5.2, 95% CI 3.1 to 7.3; p = 0.01). No adverse events were reported.\n\nTrial registration: [Trial registration number]\n\nFunding: This study received no specific funding.",
