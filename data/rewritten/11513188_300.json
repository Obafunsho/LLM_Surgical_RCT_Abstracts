A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Fibrinolytic Agents in Peripheral Arterial Ischaemia\n\nBackground: Peripheral arterial thrombolysis is essential for treating peripheral arterial ischaemia. This study assesses the efficacy and safety of various fibrinolytic agents.\n\nMethods: This randomised controlled trial involved 687 participants with peripheral arterial occlusion, recruited from multiple clinical settings. Eligibility required confirmed peripheral arterial occlusion. Participants were randomised to receive intra-arterial recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA), intra-arterial streptokinase, or intravenous rt-PA. The primary outcome was vessel patency at 30 days. Randomisation was computer-generated, and allocation was concealed using sealed envelopes. Blinding details were not specified. The analysis was conducted on an intention-to-treat basis.\n\nResults: Intra-arterial rt-PA significantly improved vessel patency compared to intra-arterial streptokinase (P < 0.04) and intravenous rt-PA (P < 0.01). No significant difference in limb salvage at 30 days was observed between urokinase and rt-PA, possibly due to small sample sizes. Haemorrhagic complications were more frequent with intravenous rt-PA and intra-arterial streptokinase than with intra-arterial rt-PA (P < 0.05). The number of participants analysed was not specified.\n\nInterpretation: Intra-arterial rt-PA is more effective in improving vessel patency than intra-arterial streptokinase or intravenous rt-PA. No significant difference in limb salvage was found between urokinase and rt-PA. Haemorrhagic complications were not significantly higher with rt-PA. The findings are limited by small study sizes and a lack of new studies in this update.\n\nTrial registration: Not provided.\n\nFunding: Not reported.",
