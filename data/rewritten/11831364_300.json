This trial assessed the effectiveness and safety of decellularized dermis (DCD) allografts as an adjunctive treatment for VLUs.\n\nMethods: This prospective, open-label, randomised controlled trial was conducted across 17 UK centres. Participants were adults with VLUs ≥3 months and ≥2 cm², with venous incompetence and an ankle-brachial pressure index ≥0.8. Participants were randomised 1:1 to receive either DCD allograft plus standard care or standard care alone. The primary outcome was the proportion of patients with a healed index ulcer at 12 weeks. Randomisation was automated, and outcome assessors were blinded.\n\nResults: Between October 2019 and October 2022, 71 participants were randomised (36 to intervention, 35 to control). Healing was observed in 5.7% of the intervention group and 15.2% of the control group (OR 0.34, 95% CI 0.03 to 2.31). No significant differences were found in secondary outcomes, including ulcer area change, time to healing, recurrence rates, and quality of life. Five serious adverse events were attributed to DCD application. The trial was terminated early following an interim analysis due to a lower-than-expected primary outcome rate (11.3%).\n\nInterpretation: DCD allografts did not improve healing rates of VLUs, and important clinical benefits or harms could not be excluded due to early termination and small sample size. Further research is needed to explore the potential of DCD in VLU treatment.\n\nTrial registration: ISRCTN 21541209\n\nFunding: JP Moulton Charitable Trust",
