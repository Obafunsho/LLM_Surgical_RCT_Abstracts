A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Two-Stage Turnbull-Cutait Pull-Through vs. Standard Coloanal Anastomosis\n\nBackground: Two-stage Turnbull-Cutait pull-through hand-sewn coloanal anastomosis may reduce postoperative morbidity compared to standard hand-sewn coloanal anastomosis with diverting ileostomy in low rectal cancer surgery.\n\nMethods: This multicenter randomised clinical trial was conducted at Bellvitge University Hospital, Valle d’Hebron University Hospital in Spain, and Instituto Nazionale Tumori Fondazione G. Pascale in Italy. Eligible patients undergoing ultralow anterior rectal resection were randomised to either the two-stage Turnbull-Cutait pull-through or standard hand-sewn coloanal anastomosis with diverting ileostomy. Randomisation was performed using a computer-generated sequence, and allocation was concealed. Neither patients nor surgeons were blinded. The primary outcome was 30-day postoperative morbidity. Data were collected from June 2012 to October 2018.\n\nResults: Ninety-two patients were randomised, with 46 in each group. The 30-day postoperative complication rate was 34.8% in the two-stage group and 45.7% in the standard group (difference = -10.9, 95% CI, -29.5 to 8.9; P = .40). Seven patients in the standard group did not undergo ileostomy reversal, and one patient in the two-stage group did not undergo delayed anastomosis. Analysis was intention-to-treat.\n\nInterpretation: The two-stage pull-through hand-sewn coloanal anastomosis is safe and does not increase postoperative morbidity compared to the standard approach.
