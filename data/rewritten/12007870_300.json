The Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations (GRADE) criteria were applied by both AI and human reviewers to evaluate the quality of evidence. The primary outcome was the quality of evidence scores assigned by AI and humans.\n\nResults: Eighteen studies involving 3131 patients were reviewed. Seven studies addressed length of stay, with five showing shorter stays with NPWT. Fourteen studies examined infection rates, with eight finding significant improvement using NPWT. Twelve articles analyzed time to wound closure, with nine reporting reduced time with NPWT. AI generally assigned lower quality of evidence scores compared to humans, potentially indicating reduced bias.\n\nInterpretation: AI demonstrates potential in supporting systematic reviews but remains limited in accurately determining evidence quality. AI's lower scores may reflect reduced bias. The study underscores the challenges in generating high-level evidence for NPWT due to trial design complexities and the diversity of its application. No adverse events were reported. The trial was not registered, and no funding source was disclosed. The findings suggest that while AI can aid in systematic reviews, further development is needed to enhance its accuracy in evidence assessment. The study highlights the need for standardized criteria in NPWT research to improve evidence quality.",
