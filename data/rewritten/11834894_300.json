This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness and complications associated with different perineural catheter designs and fixation methods.\n\nMethods: This randomised controlled trial was conducted at a tertiary care hospital. Participants were adults undergoing elective thoracoabdominal surgery, eligible if they required postoperative analgesia. A total of 200 participants were randomised: 100 to the intervention group receiving catheter-over-needle design and 100 to the control group receiving catheter-through-needle design. Randomisation was computer-generated, and allocation was concealed using sealed envelopes. Blinding was maintained for outcome assessors, patients, and clinicians.\n\nIntervention: The intervention group received catheter-over-needle design, while the control group received catheter-through-needle design. The primary outcome was the duration of effective analgesia, measured over 48 hours postoperatively.\n\nResults: 98 participants in the intervention group and 97 in the control group were analysed using an intention-to-treat approach. The intervention group showed a mean difference in analgesia duration of 5.2 hours (95% CI 3.1 to 7.3; p = 0.01) compared to the control. Adverse events were reported in 3% of the intervention group and 1% of the control group, primarily mild infections. No severe adverse events were reported.\n\nInterpretation: The catheter-over-needle design provides a significant increase in analgesia duration with minimal adverse events. This study supports its use in clinical practice for enhanced postoperative pain management. The findings suggest that careful selection of catheter design and fixation methods can optimize patient outcomes and reduce complications.\n\nTrial registration: NCT12345678.\n\nFunding: This study was funded by the National Institute of Health.",
