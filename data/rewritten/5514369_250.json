A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of 17 β-Estradiol in Postmenopausal Women Undergoing Cardiac Surgery\n\nBackground: This randomised controlled trial evaluated the impact of perioperative 17 β-estradiol on neurocognitive dysfunction and quality of life in postmenopausal women undergoing cardiac surgery.\n\nMethods: A total of 174 postmenopausal women were randomly assigned to receive either 17 β-estradiol or placebo in a double-blind manner, starting the day before surgery and continuing until the fifth postoperative day. Participants were recruited from a single cardiac surgery center. The primary outcome was neurocognitive dysfunction, assessed using a standard psychometric battery at baseline, 4 to 6 weeks, and 6 months postoperatively. Quality of life was measured using the SF-36 and Lawton scales at baseline and 6 months. Randomisation was computer-generated, and allocation was concealed. Blinding included patients, clinicians, and outcome assessors.\n\nResults: Of the 174 participants, 108 completed the study (54 in each group). Thirteen percent exhibited neurocognitive dysfunction postoperatively. Neurocognitive deficits were independently associated with lower SF-36 physical scores (P = 0.004) and Lawton scores (P = 0.026) at 6 months. 17 β-estradiol treatment (P = 0.003) and smoking (P = 0.015) predicted worse SF-36 mental scores. Preoperative scores were predictors of postoperative quality of life.\n\nInterpretation: Postoperative neurocognitive dysfunction adversely affects quality of life. Perioperative 17 β-estradiol does not improve outcomes. Preoperative health status influences postoperative quality of life.\n\nTrial registration: [Trial registration number]\n\nFunding: [Source of funding]",
