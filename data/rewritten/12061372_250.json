Participants were randomised in a 2:2:1 ratio to receive suzetrigine (100 mg loading dose, then 50 mg every 12 h), hydrocodone bitartrate/acetaminophen (5/325 mg every 6 h), or placebo for 48 h. The primary outcome was the time-weighted sum of the pain intensity difference (SPID48) on the numeric pain rating scale. Randomisation was computer-generated, and allocation was concealed using an interactive web response system. Blinding included patients, clinicians, and outcome assessors.\n\nResults: A total of 2,191 participants were randomised: 1,118 in the abdominoplasty trial and 1,073 in the bunionectomy trial. The primary endpoint was achieved with suzetrigine showing a significant reduction in pain versus placebo (abdominoplasty: mean difference 48.4, 95% CI 33.6 to 63.1, P < 0.0001; bunionectomy: mean difference 29.3, 95% CI 14.0 to 44.6, P = 0.0002). Adverse events were mild to moderate.\n\nInterpretation: Suzetrigine effectively reduced acute pain over 48 h post-surgery, with a safety profile similar to placebo. Trial registration: NCT05558410, NCT05553366. Funding: Vertex Pharmaceuticals.",
