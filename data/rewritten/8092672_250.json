A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Alpha-Blockers as Adjuvant Therapy in Shock Wave Lithotripsy\n\nBackground: Shock wave lithotripsy (SWL) is a common treatment for renal and ureteral stones. Alpha-blockers may aid in stone fragment passage, but their efficacy is uncertain.\n\nMethods: This randomised controlled trial included adults undergoing SWL for renal or ureteral stones. Participants were randomised to receive either alpha-blockers plus usual care or usual care alone. The primary outcome was stone clearance rate, measured within 4 weeks post-SWL. Randomisation was computer-generated, with allocation concealment via sealed envelopes. Blinding was applied to outcome assessors.\n\nResults: A total of 4793 participants were randomised: 2396 to the intervention group and 2397 to the control group. Analysis was conducted on 4084 participants using an intention-to-treat approach. Alpha-blockers may improve stone clearance (RR 1.16, 95% CI 1.09 to 1.23). They may reduce auxiliary treatments (RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.45 to 1.00) and major adverse events (RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.46 to 0.80). No drug-related major adverse events were reported. The intervention may reduce stone clearance time (MD –3.74 days, 95% CI –5.25 to –2.23).\n\nInterpretation: Alpha-blockers as adjuvant therapy post-SWL may enhance stone clearance, reduce auxiliary treatments, and decrease major adverse events, though evidence is of low certainty. Further research is needed to confirm these findings.\n\nTrial registration: Not provided.\n\nFunding: Not reported.",
