A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Virtual Reality in Surgical Training: A Randomised Controlled Trial\n\nBackground: This randomised controlled trial evaluated the effectiveness of virtual reality (VR) simulation in teaching intramedullary tibial nailing to medical students. \n\nMethods: Twenty-five first- and second-year medical students without prior exposure to the procedure were recruited and randomly assigned to one of three groups: technique guide control (n = 8), VR group (n = 8), or VR and technique guide group (n = 9). The primary outcome was the completion of the procedure, defined as proper placement of the nail and screw, assessed by a blinded orthopaedic surgeon. Procedural accuracy was measured by the number of incorrect steps out of 16. Randomisation was performed using a computer-generated sequence, and allocation was concealed. \n\nResults: A higher proportion of participants in the VR group (6 of 8) and the VR and technique guide group (7 of 9) completed the procedure compared to the technique guide group (2 of 8; p = 0.01). Participants in the VR groups had fewer incorrect steps (3.2 ± 0.1 and 3.1 ± 0.1) than the technique guide group (5.7 ± 0.2; p = 0.02). No adverse events were reported. \n\nInterpretation: VR training improved procedural completion and accuracy compared to a technique guide alone. These findings suggest VR could enhance surgical education. Further research should explore its application in residency programs. \n\nTrial registration: Not provided. \n\nFunding: Not disclosed.",
