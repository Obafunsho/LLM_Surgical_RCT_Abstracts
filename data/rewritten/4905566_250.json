Sixty-one obese participants with T2DM were randomised to either an intensive lifestyle weight loss intervention (LWLI) for 1 year followed by a lower lifestyle weight loss intervention (LLLI) for 2 years, or surgical treatments [Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) or Laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding (LAGB)] followed by LLLI in years 2 and 3. The primary outcome was partial and complete diabetes remission at 3 years. Randomisation was performed using a computer-generated sequence, and allocation was concealed. Blinding was not specified.\n\nResults: Of the 61 participants, 26 (43%) had a BMI <35 kg/m², 50 (82%) were women, and 13 (21%) were African American. Partial or complete T2DM remission was achieved by 40% (n=8) of RYGB, 29% (n=6) of LAGB, and 0% of LWLI participants (p=0.0037). Diabetes medication use was reduced more in surgical groups; 65% of RYGB, 33% of LAGB, and 0% of LWLI participants discontinued medication (p<0.0001). Mean weight reduction was 25.0% (RYGB), 15.0% (LAGB), and 5.7% (LWLI) (p<0.01).\n\nInterpretation: Bariatric surgery with adjunctive LLLI resulted in greater T2DM remission than lifestyle intervention alone. No adverse events were reported. Trial registration and funding details were not provided.",
