A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of ROTEM®-Guided Transfusion Strategy in Obstetric Haemorrhage\n\nBackground: This study aimed to assess the impact of a ROTEM®-guided transfusion strategy on the management of postpartum haemorrhage (PPH) ≥1500 ml compared to conventional methods.\n\nMethods: Conducted at the Rotunda Hospital, Dublin, this retrospective analysis included 944 women with PPH ≥1500 ml over five years. Participants were divided into a post-ROTEM® group (238 women) and a pre-ROTEM® group (706 women). The primary outcome was the overall consumption of blood coagulation products, measured over one year post-implementation. Randomisation and blinding details are not applicable as this was a retrospective analysis.\n\nResults: The post-ROTEM® group demonstrated a 46% reduction in fibrinogen concentrate use, a 72% decrease in Octaplas®, and a 79% reduction in platelet use, resulting in a cost saving of €51,738. Compliance with evidence-based fibrinogen transfusion triggers improved significantly from 23% to 84%. There was no significant difference in the progression to severe haemorrhage (≥2000 ml) between groups (40% vs. 44%, p=0.35). No adverse events were reported.\n\nInterpretation: The implementation of a ROTEM®-guided transfusion strategy, supported by an electronic decision tool and comprehensive staff training, significantly improved adherence to evidence-based transfusion practices, reduced unnecessary coagulation product use, and generated substantial cost savings without negatively impacting clinical outcomes. These findings provide valuable insights for institutions aiming to optimise transfusion strategies in obstetric haemorrhage through structured implementation approaches.\n\nTrial registration: Not applicable.\n\nFunding: Not specified.",
