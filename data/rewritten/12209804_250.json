A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial on Acute Kidney Disease Post-Acute Kidney Injury\n\nBackground: Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a prevalent condition with a risk of progression to chronic kidney disease (CKD). Acute kidney disease (AKD) represents the transition phase from AKI to CKD. This study aims to explore the epidemiology, risk factors, and outcomes of AKD following AKI.\n\nMethods: This randomised controlled trial was conducted in a hospital setting. Participants were adult patients with AKI. The intervention group received structured follow-up care, while the control group received standard care. The primary outcome was the progression to CKD within 12 months. Randomisation was computer-generated, and allocation was concealed using sealed envelopes. Outcome assessors were blinded to group allocation.\n\nResults: A total of 200 participants were randomised: 100 to the intervention group and 100 to the control group. Analysis was conducted on 98 participants in the intervention group and 97 in the control group using an intention-to-treat approach. The intervention group showed a reduced progression to CKD (hazard ratio = 0.75, 95% CI 0.60 to 0.90; p = 0.01). Adverse events were reported in 3% of the intervention group and 1% of the control group.\n\nInterpretation: Structured follow-up care significantly reduces the risk of progression to CKD in patients with AKD post-AKI. This highlights the importance of multidisciplinary care in improving long-term outcomes.\n\nTrial registration: NCT12345678\n\nFunding: This trial was funded by the National Institutes of Health.",
