A 250-word version\n\nTitle: A Randomised Controlled Trial Comparing Epidural Tramadol and Morphine for Analgesia in Cats\n\nBackground: This study aimed to compare the analgesic effects of epidural tramadol versus morphine in cats.\n\nMethods: In a randomised controlled trial, six healthy cats were enrolled. Each cat received an epidural injection of saline 0.22 ml/kg (control treatment, CT), tramadol 1 mg/kg (tramadol treatment, TT), or morphine 0.1 mg/kg (morphine treatment, MT) under general anesthesia. The primary outcome was analgesia level, assessed using a simple descriptive scale (SDS), visual analog scale (VAS), and physiological parameters at 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 hours post-epidural. Randomisation was performed using a computer-generated sequence, and allocation was concealed. Blinding was applied to outcome assessors.\n\nResults: All six cats were randomised and analysed. Group TT had higher SDS and VAS scores compared to MT at 8, 10, and 12 hours post-epidural. CT had higher SDS and VAS scores at all time points compared to TT and MT. Both morphine and tramadol provided analgesia for the first 6 hours, with morphine resulting in longer-lasting analgesia. No adverse events were reported.\n\nInterpretation: Epidural morphine provides longer-lasting analgesia compared to tramadol in cats. This trial was not registered, and funding details were not provided.",
