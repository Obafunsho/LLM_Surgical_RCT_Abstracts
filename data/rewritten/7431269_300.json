A 300-word version\n\nTitle: A Randomised Controlled Trial of Bicruciate-Retaining versus Cruciate-Retaining Total Knee Arthroplasty\n\nBackground: Bicruciate-retaining total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is designed to enhance clinical outcomes by preserving anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) function. However, its unique tibial component design may affect fixation. This study assesses tibial component migration and patient-reported outcomes.\n\nMethods: This parallel-group trial (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT01966848) randomised 50 patients with intact ACLs undergoing TKA to receive either bicruciate-retaining or cruciate-retaining TKA. The primary outcome was maximum total point motion (MTPM) of the tibial component at 2 years, measured by radiostereometric analysis (RSA). Secondary outcomes included Oxford Knee Score (OKS) and Forgotten Joint Score (FJS). Randomisation was computer-generated, and patients were blinded to allocation. The study was powered to detect a 0.2-mm difference in MTPM (SD = 0.2, significance level = 5%, power = 80%).\n\nResults: At 2 years, RSA data were available for 22 bicruciate-retaining and 23 cruciate-retaining patients, while patient-reported outcomes were available for 24 patients in each group. No significant difference in MTPM was observed (median MTPM: 0.52 mm vs. 0.42 mm, p = 0.63). Improvements in OKS and FJS were similar between groups. Three bicruciate-retaining patients required arthroscopic manipulation, and one sustained a tibial fracture requiring revision. No reoperations or revisions occurred in the cruciate-retaining group.\n\nInterpretation: With the numbers available, no differences in tibial fixation or patient-reported outcomes were found between the bicruciate-retaining and cruciate-retaining groups. The bicruciate-retaining device demonstrated a learning curve and potential risks without clear benefits, suggesting it should not be routinely used. Further research should be conducted in controlled trials.\n\nFunding: Not specified.",
