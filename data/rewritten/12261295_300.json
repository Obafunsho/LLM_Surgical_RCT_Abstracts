A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Analgesic Strategies After Open Liver Resection\n\nBackground: Effective postoperative pain management is crucial for recovery after open liver resection. This randomised controlled trial evaluated the efficacy of intravenous (i.v.) analgesia alone or combined with catheter wound infusion (CWI) or intrathecal morphine (ITM).\n\nMethods: In this single-centre trial, 186 adult patients undergoing open liver resection at the University Hospital of Lille, France, were randomly assigned in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive i.v. analgesia alone, i.v. analgesia with CWI, or i.v. analgesia with ITM. The primary outcome was the cumulative morphine dose at 24 hours. Randomisation was performed using sealed envelopes with a computer-generated sequence, and allocation was open-label. The analysis was conducted on an intention-to-treat basis.\n\nResults: A total of 186 patients were randomised and analysed (62 per group) between May 2015 and December 2020. The median 24-hour morphine dose was 14 mg (i.q.r. 6–25) in the i.v. group, 14 mg (i.q.r. 7–23) in the CWI group, and 7 mg (i.q.r. 3–15) in the ITM group. ITM significantly reduced morphine use compared to i.v. analgesia alone (mean difference on log-transformed values 0.57; 95% CI 0.21 to 0.93; P = 0.002). Pain scores were also lower in the ITM group during the first 12 hours. No significant differences were observed between the CWI and i.v. analgesia groups. By 72 hours, cumulative opioid use was similar across all groups. Adverse events and postoperative complications were comparable across the three groups.\n\nInterpretation: ITM effectively reduced morphine consumption and pain intensity in the first 24 hours post-surgery, offering a valuable option for postoperative analgesia. This approach could be particularly beneficial for major liver resections where the risk of acute kidney injury is significant.\n\nTrial registration: NCT03238430.\n\nFunding: Not specified.",
