A 300-word version\n\nTitle: A Randomised Controlled Trial of Ventilation Modes in Pediatric Thoracic Surgery\n\nBackground: This randomised controlled trial assessed whether pressure-controlled ventilation-volume guaranteed (PCV-VG) reduces intrapulmonary shunt (Qs/Qt) and ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI) in pediatric patients undergoing thoracic surgery with one-lung ventilation (OLV).\n\nMethods: Eighty-three children aged 6 months to 18 years, classified as ASA I-III, undergoing video-assisted thoracoscopic lobectomy with OLV at Hunan Children’s Hospital, China, were randomly assigned to either the PCV-VG group (n=42) or the volume-controlled ventilation (VCV) group (n=41). The primary outcome was Qs/Qt, measured at five time points during surgery. Secondary outcomes included respiratory parameters, blood gas analysis, and postoperative pulmonary complications (PPCs). Randomisation was computer-generated with allocation concealed in opaque envelopes. Data collectors and surgical staff were blinded.\n\nResults: The PCV-VG group demonstrated a significant reduction in median Qs/Qt during OLV (18.2 to 12.7 at T2, 11.4 to 9.1 at T3, p<0.0001). Compared to VCV, PCV-VG improved oxygenation (higher PaO2, PaO2/FiO2), reduced airway pressure (25 cmH2O to 20 cmH2O at T2, p<0.0001), and lowered PPCs incidence (38.5% to 7.3%, OR 0.13, 95% CI: 0.03–0.50, p=0.001). The duration of postoperative mechanical ventilation was shorter in the PCV-VG group (120 min to 110 min, difference 20, 95% CI 0 to 40, p=0.036). No adverse events were reported.\n\nInterpretation: PCV-VG significantly benefits pediatric patients by improving Qs/Qt, oxygenation, and reducing airway pressure and VILI during OLV, suggesting its potential as a preferred ventilation mode in pediatric thoracic surgery.\n\nTrial registration: ChiCTR2200065237.\n\nFunding: Not specified.",
