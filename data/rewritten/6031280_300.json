A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Caudal Zona Incerta Deep Brain Stimulation in Parkinson’s Disease\n\nBackground: This study aims to objectively evaluate the efficacy of deep brain stimulation (DBS) in the caudal zona incerta (cZi) for treating Parkinson’s disease (PD) symptoms.\n\nMethods: In a single-blind, randomised controlled trial, 25 patients with idiopathic PD, eligible for subthalamic nucleus DBS, were randomised to either bilateral cZi DBS or best medical treatment. The primary outcomes were differences in the motor scores of the Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS-III) and the Parkinson’s Disease Questionnaire 39 items (PDQ-39) at 6 months. Randomisation was computer-generated, and allocation was concealed. Outcome assessors were blinded. The study was conducted at a single center.\n\nResults: Nineteen patients completed the study: 9 in the DBS group and 10 in the medical group. The DBS group showed a 41% improvement in UPDRS-III scores off-medication on-stimulation compared to baseline, while the medical group showed no change. In the on-medication condition, no significant differences were observed between groups. Subitems of the UPDRS-III demonstrated a robust effect of cZi DBS on tremor. The PDQ-39 domains ‘stigma’ and ‘ADL’ improved only in the DBS group, while the summary index improved in both groups. Adverse events included one case of deep venous thrombosis in the DBS group.\n\nInterpretation: cZi DBS significantly improved tremor and quality of life in PD patients, although dopaminergic medication doses remained unchanged. This study supports cZi DBS as a viable target for PD treatment, offering an alternative to established targets and enabling tailored surgical approaches.\n\nTrial registration: Not provided.\n\nFunding: Not specified.",
