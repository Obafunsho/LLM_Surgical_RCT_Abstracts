  "abstract": "1. A 250-word version\n\nBackground: This study investigates the feasibility of using low-frequency components of spontaneous functional MR imaging signals for presurgical motor function mapping in patients with tumors or epileptic foci near the motor cortex.\n\nMethods: Six surgical candidates participated in this study. The study was conducted at a single center. Participants were selected based on the proximity of their tumors or epileptic foci to the motor cortex. The intervention involved mapping the motor network using intrinsic activity correlations, while the comparator was task-elicited activation of the motor system. The primary outcome was the precision of motor function mapping, assessed by comparing intrinsic activity correlations with task-elicited activation and direct cortical stimulation. Randomization and allocation concealment methods were not applicable. Blinding was not implemented.\n\nResults: The motor regions identified through intrinsic activity correlations were similar to those defined by task-elicited activation and cortical stimulation. The study demonstrated the potential of using intrinsic activity correlations for mapping the motor cortex in presurgical patients. No adverse events were reported.\n\nInterpretation: The task-free paradigm using intrinsic activity correlations offers a promising approach for mapping functional anatomy in patients who cannot comply with tasks, allowing multiple brain systems to be assessed in a single scanning session. The study was not registered as a randomized controlled trial, and no funding information is available.",
