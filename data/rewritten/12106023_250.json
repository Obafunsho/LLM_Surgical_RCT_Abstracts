This study evaluates the prognostic value of the grey-to-white matter ratio (GWR) in predicting neurological outcomes in heat stroke patients.\n\nMethods: This multicentre retrospective study included 128 heat stroke patients from five hospitals in China between January 2020 and November 2023. Eligibility criteria included patients over 18 years with heat stroke who underwent cranial CT. Patients were stratified by Cerebral Performance Category (CPC) scores at discharge. Seven GWR parameters were calculated. The primary outcome was neurological status at discharge, assessed by CPC scores. Randomisation and blinding were not applicable due to the retrospective design.\n\nResults: All GWRs were significantly lower in the poor outcome group (CPC 3–5) than in the good outcome group (CPC 1–2). The GWR basal ganglia had the highest sensitivity (80.95%) and specificity (90.77%) for predicting poor outcomes. Combining GWR with qSOFA improved predictive performance. No adverse events were reported.\n\nInterpretation: A low GWR is strongly associated with poor neurological outcomes in heat stroke patients. GWR, combined with qSOFA, enhances early prediction of poor outcomes. Trial registration: ChiCTR2400079671. Funding: Not specified.",
