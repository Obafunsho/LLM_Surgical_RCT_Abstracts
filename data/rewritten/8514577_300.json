This study aimed to determine if intraoperative methylprednisolone during neonatal cardiac surgery is associated with neurodevelopmental outcomes at 12 months of age.\n\nMethods: This was a planned secondary analysis of a two-center, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial conducted in [study setting]. Neonates undergoing cardiac surgery were randomized to receive either intraoperative methylprednisolone or placebo. The primary outcome was neurodevelopmental outcomes measured by the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development-III (BSID-III) at 12 months. Randomization was computer-generated, and allocation was concealed. Blinding included outcome assessors, patients, and clinicians. Sample size calculation was based on detecting a clinically significant difference in BSID-III scores.\n\nResults: A total of 129 participants were randomized (61 to methylprednisolone, 68 to placebo) and analyzed using an intention-to-treat approach. There were no significant differences in BSID-III scores between the two groups. Participants undergoing palliative procedures had lower cognitive (mean difference = -5, 95% CI -9 to -1, p=0.03) and motor scores (mean difference = -9, 95% CI -14 to -4, p<0.01). Longer ventilation time and CICU stay were associated with lower scores. No adverse events were reported in either group.\n\nInterpretation: Intraoperative methylprednisolone was not associated with improved neurodevelopmental outcomes. Palliative procedures were linked to worse outcomes. Interventions focused solely on the operative period may not yield long-term neurodevelopmental benefits.\n\nTrial registration: [Trial registration number]\n\nFunding: [Source of funding]",
