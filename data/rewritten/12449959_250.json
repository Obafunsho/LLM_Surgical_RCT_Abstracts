A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial Comparing Covered Stents and Drug-Coated Balloons in Femoropopliteal Artery Occlusion\n\nBackground: This study aimed to evaluate the midterm efficacy of covered stents (CS) versus drug-coated balloons (DCB) in patients with femoropopliteal artery occlusion.\n\nMethods: In this multicenter retrospective study, 194 patients with chronic total femoropopliteal occlusion were included from seven centers between January 2020 and December 2022. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either CS (n=94) or DCB (n=100) angioplasty. The primary outcome was primary patency at 24 months. Secondary outcomes included freedom from clinically driven target lesion revascularization, limb salvage, major adverse events, and overall survival rates. Propensity score matching was used to confirm the main endpoints.\n\nResults: The CS group showed significantly greater primary patency at 24 months compared to the DCB group (74.4% vs. 55.8%, p=0.019). Subgroup analyses indicated superior patency in patients with diabetes (p=0.010) and proximal reference vessel diameter ≥5.0 mm (p=0.038). A baseline ankle-brachial index <0.40 was an independent risk factor for restenosis, while a postprocedural index ≥0.80 and CS use (HR, 0.54 [95% CI, 0.32–0.91], p=0.021) were protective factors. No significant differences were observed in secondary outcomes.\n\nInterpretation: The CS procedure demonstrated superior primary patency at 24 months compared to DCB in complicated femoropopliteal artery occlusion lesions. No significant differences were found in secondary outcomes. The study was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 82370459).",
