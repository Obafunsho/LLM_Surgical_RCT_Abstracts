A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Cost-Effectiveness of Primary Anastomosis versus Hartmann's Procedure for Perforated Diverticulitis: A Randomised Controlled Trial\n\nBackground: This study aimed to assess the cost-effectiveness of primary anastomosis (PA) compared to Hartmann's procedure (HP) for treating Hinchey grade III or IV diverticulitis within the DIVA arm of the Ladies trial.\n\nMethods: The trial was an international, multicentre, randomised, open-label superiority trial. Participants were randomly assigned to PA or HP in a 1:1 ratio following diagnostic laparoscopy. The primary outcome was 12-month stoma-free survival. Randomisation was centrally managed, and allocation was not concealed. Blinding was not applied. A total of 130 patients were randomised between July 2010 and June 2016, with 64 allocated to PA and 66 to HP. Analysis was conducted using a modified intention-to-treat approach.\n\nResults: Mean costs per patient were lower for PA (€20,544, 95% CI 19,569 to 21,519) compared to HP (€28,670, 95% CI 26,636 to 30,704), with a mean difference of €–8,126 (95% CI –14,660 to –1,592). The ICER was €–39,094 (95% BCa CI –1,213 to –116), indicating PA was more cost-effective. The mean probability of being stoma-free at 12 months was 86% (95% CI 74 to 93) for PA and 65% (95% CI 53 to 75) for HP. No significant adverse events were reported.\n\nInterpretation: PA is more cost-effective than HP for perforated diverticulitis with purulent or faecal peritonitis. The trial was registered at trialregister.nl (NTR2037) and ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT01317485). Funding was provided by the Dutch National Health Care Institute.",
