A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of VTE Prophylaxis in Korean Patients Undergoing Gastrectomy\n\nBackground: Thromboprophylaxis is recommended for gastric adenocarcinoma patients, but its use is less common in Asia due to perceived lower VTE incidence.\n\nMethods: This randomised controlled trial was conducted at Seoul St Mary’s Hospital, South Korea, from August 1, 2011, to March 31, 2015. Patients with histologically confirmed gastric adenocarcinoma were randomised to receive either intermittent pneumatic compression (IPC) alone or IPC plus low-molecular-weight (LMW) heparin sodium. Randomisation was performed using a computer-generated sequence with allocation concealment. The primary outcome was VTE incidence within the postoperative period. Secondary outcomes included postoperative complications related to VTE prophylaxis. Blinding was not applied.\n\nResults: A total of 682 patients were randomised, with 341 in each group. The analysis included 666 patients, using both intention-to-treat and per-protocol approaches. VTE incidence was 3.6% in the IPC-only group and 0.6% in the IPC+LMW heparin group (P = .008). Bleeding complications occurred in 9.1% of the IPC+LMW heparin group and 1.2% of the IPC-only group (P < .001). No VTE-associated mortality was observed.\n\nInterpretation: IPC alone is less effective than IPC+LMW heparin in preventing postoperative VTE, but LMW heparin increases bleeding risk. Further research is needed to identify patients at high risk for VTE.\n\nTrial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01448746\n\nFunding: Not specified.",
