A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Incidence and Impact of Rib Fracture in Thoracotomy: A Retrospective Analysis\n\nBackground: Rib fracture during thoracotomy with rib spreading is a frequent but under-investigated event. This study aimed to evaluate the incidence of rib fractures, associated risk factors, and their relationship with post-operative pain and complications.\n\nMethods: This retrospective study was conducted at a single institution, analyzing medical records of patients who underwent lateral thoracotomy from January 2016 to June 2023. Eligibility criteria included patients over 18 years undergoing thoracotomy, excluding those with traumatic etiology or osteoporosis. Rib fractures were identified through surgical reports and post-operative chest X-rays. Pain was assessed using the Visual Analogue Scale, and 30-day post-operative complications were recorded.\n\nResults: A total of 367 patients were included, with a median age of 68 years. Rib fractures were detected in 179 patients (48.8%). The incidence remained consistent over the years (p = 0.98). Age greater than the median was significantly associated with rib fractures (p = 0.003). Patients with rib fractures experienced higher evoked pain at 48 hours post-surgery (p = 0.039) and a higher incidence of complications (32/179 vs 20/188; p = 0.047).\n\nInterpretation: Rib fractures occur in nearly half of thoracotomies, with older patients at higher risk. These fractures are associated with increased post-operative pain and complications. The findings highlight the need for improved management strategies and potential development of less traumatic surgical tools. The study underscores the importance of considering patient age in surgical planning and post-operative care to mitigate the risk and impact of rib fractures. Further research is needed to explore preventive measures and refine surgical techniques to reduce the incidence of this complication.",
