This study evaluated the efficacy of cryoneurolysis in reducing phantom pain.\n\nMethods: This randomised controlled trial enrolled patients with lower-limb amputation and established phantom pain at a tertiary care center. Participants received a single-injection femoral and sciatic nerve block with lidocaine and were randomised to receive either ultrasound-guided percutaneous cryoneurolysis or sham treatment. The primary outcome was the change in average phantom pain intensity from baseline to 4 months, measured using a Numeric Rating Scale (0–10). Randomisation was computer-generated, and allocation was concealed. Investigators, participants, and clinical staff were blinded, except for the treating physician.\n\nResults: A total of 144 participants were randomised: 71 to cryoneurolysis and 73 to sham. Pain intensity decreased by 0.5 [−0.5, 3.0] in the cryoneurolysis group versus 0 [0, 3] in the sham group, with an estimated difference of −0.1 (95% CI −1.0, 0.7), P=0.759. One serious adverse event occurred in the cryoneurolysis group due to a protocol deviation.\n\nInterpretation: Cryoneurolysis did not significantly reduce phantom limb pain at 4 months. Further research is needed to optimize treatment parameters.\n\nTrial registration: [Trial registration number]\n\nFunding: [Source of funding]",
