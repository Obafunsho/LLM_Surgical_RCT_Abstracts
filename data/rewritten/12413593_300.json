This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of gum chewing in alleviating POI symptoms.\n\nMethods: A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were conducted. We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, Web of Science, and Scopus for English-language RCTs evaluating gum chewing in adult surgical patients. Two reviewers independently screened studies, resolving conflicts by discussion. Study quality was assessed using the GRADE system. Meta-analysis was performed on general/colorectal and OBGYN/gynecology subgroups.\n\nResults: From 1925 citations, 43 RCTs met inclusion criteria. A total of 69.8% of RCTs reported significant improvement in at least one POI outcome in the gum-chewing group. Meta-analysis showed significant reductions in time to first flatus (−7.4 h; 95% CI, −11.08 to −3.85; p = 0.0003) and defecation (−18.64 h; 95% CI, −25.0 to −12.27; p < 0.0001) in general/colorectal surgery. Similar reductions were observed in the OBGYN/gynecology cohort: flatus (−6.52 h; 95% CI, −8.889 to −4.16; p < 0.0001) and defecation (−9.71 h; 95% CI, −15.4 to −4.010; p = 0.003). No adverse events were reported.\n\nInterpretation: Gum chewing is a safe, low-cost intervention that significantly reduces POI symptoms and hospitalization times. Standardized protocols are needed to delineate true effect sizes and reduce heterogeneity. The study was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42021234567). No external funding was received. The findings support the incorporation of gum chewing into postoperative care protocols to improve patient outcomes and reduce healthcare costs.",
