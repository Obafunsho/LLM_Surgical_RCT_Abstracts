Patients were randomised using block randomisation with sealed envelopes. The primary outcome was the occlusion rate of the great saphenous vein (GSV) at 12 months, assessed by duplex ultrasound. Secondary outcomes included quality of life measured by the Aberdeen Varicose Vein Severity Score (AVVSS) and perioperative pain. Blinding was not applied to patients or clinicians.\n\nResults: A total of 214 patients were randomised: 65 to surgery, 73 to EVLA, and 76 to UGFS, between November 2007 and May 2010. At 12 months, GSV occlusion was achieved in 97% of surgery and EVLA patients, compared to 51% in the UGFS group (P < 0.001). AVVSS improved significantly in all groups with no significant differences. UGFS resulted in less perioperative pain and shorter sick leave (mean 1 day) compared to EVLA (8 days) and surgery (12 days). No major complications were reported, with minor complications such as haematoma and skin pigmentation occurring more frequently in the UGFS group.\n\nInterpretation: UGFS offers equivalent quality of life improvement but higher residual GSV reflux compared to surgery and EVLA. The study highlights the need for longer follow-up to assess the long-term impact of residual reflux. Trial registration: Not provided. Funding: Not disclosed.",
