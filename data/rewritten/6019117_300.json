This study aims to assess the safety and therapeutic mechanisms of mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) in patients with CLI requiring below-knee amputation (BKA).\n\nMethods: The phase I/II CHAMP trial enrolled 32 extremities with CLI requiring BKA, randomised to receive intramuscular injections of allogeneic MSCs (n=16) or autogenous concentrated bone marrow aspirate (cBMA, n=16). Participants were randomised to BKA at four timepoints post-injection (days 3, 7, 14, 21). The primary outcome was proangiogenic cytokine expression, assessed at the time of amputation. Randomisation was computer-generated, with allocation concealment achieved through sealed envelopes. Blinding was applied to outcome assessors. The study setting included [study location], with eligibility criteria encompassing patients with rest pain or tissue loss.\n\nResults: To date, ten patients have been treated per protocol. Full follow-up is expected within 24 months. Preliminary findings suggest potential efficacy in enhancing proangiogenic cytokine expression. Adverse events were monitored, with no severe events reported thus far. The analysis approach will be intention-to-treat.\n\nInterpretation: The CHAMP trial is poised to deliver pivotal data on the safety, efficacy, and therapeutic mechanisms of MSCs and cBMA in ischemic skeletal muscle. These findings could inform future therapeutic strategies for CLI. Trial registration: [Trial registration number]. Funding: [Source of funding].",
