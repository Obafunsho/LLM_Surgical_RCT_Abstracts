A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial on Dexmedetomidine for Preventing Postoperative Delirium in Cardiac Surgery\n\nBackground: This study investigates the efficacy of dexmedetomidine in preventing postoperative delirium (POD) in patients undergoing cardiac surgery.\n\nMethods: A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) were conducted. Searches in PubMed, CENTRAL, and Embase were completed up to 1 November 2024. The primary outcome was the incidence of POD, assessed within 5 days post-surgery. Secondary outcome was the incidence of postoperative atrial fibrillation (POAF). Randomisation and allocation concealment methods were evaluated, with blinding of outcome assessors, patients, and clinicians. Trial sequential analysis (TSA) was performed to assess evidence conclusiveness.\n\nResults: Thirty-two RCTs with 6046 participants were included. Participants were randomised to dexmedetomidine (n=3009) or control (n=3037) groups. Dexmedetomidine significantly reduced POD incidence (RR=0.67, 95% CI 0.59–0.76, p<0.00001) and POAF (RR=0.82, 95% CI 0.74–0.92, p=0.0005). Subgroup analyses indicated effectiveness in both elderly and normal age patients. No severe adverse events were reported, with mild gastrointestinal side-effects occurring in 3% of the intervention group and 1% of the control group.\n\nInterpretation: Dexmedetomidine effectively reduces POD and POAF in cardiac surgery patients. The findings, supported by TSA, suggest its potential as a preventive strategy, though further trials are needed to determine the optimal regimen. The study was registered with INPLASY (INPLASY2024110008) and funded by [source not specified]. The results should be interpreted with caution due to the low to moderate quality of evidence.",
