A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Minimally Invasive Tissue-Selective Therapy Stapler (TST) for Severe Hemorrhoids\n\nBackground: Severe hemorrhoids adversely affect patients' quality of life. This study assesses the clinical efficacy and safety of minimally invasive TST surgery compared to PPH and EPH techniques.\n\nMethods: This randomised controlled trial was conducted at our hospital from March 2015 to February 2018. A total of 141 patients with severe hemorrhoids were randomised into three groups: TST (n=47), PPH (n=47), and EPH (n=47). Eligibility criteria included ages 18-80, grades III-IV hemorrhoids, and no prior hemorrhoid surgery. The primary outcome was clinical efficacy, defined as symptom resolution at 3 months. Secondary outcomes included hospital stay, operation time, intraoperative blood loss, and anal dynamics. Randomisation was performed using block randomisation with a block size of 6, and allocation was concealed until surgery. Due to the nature of the interventions, blinding was not possible for patients and surgeons, but outcome assessors were blinded.\n\nResults: The TST group demonstrated a higher total effective rate (93.62%) compared to PPH (74.47%) and EPH (72.34%). TST resulted in shorter hospital stays, operation times, and less intraoperative blood loss. Anal dynamics, including rectal resting pressure and anal canal pressure, improved significantly in the TST group. The complication rate was lower in the TST group (10.64%) compared to PPH (27.66%) and EPH (31.91%).\n\nInterpretation: TST is an effective and safe treatment for severe hemorrhoids, offering improved clinical outcomes and reduced complications. Trial registration: Not provided. Funding: Not reported. Further studies with longer follow-up are needed to assess long-term outcomes.",
