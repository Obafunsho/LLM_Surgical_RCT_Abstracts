A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Minimally Invasive Interventional Radiological Techniques in Colorectal Cancer Metastases\n\nBackground: Colorectal cancer is a leading cause of cancer-related mortality, with liver metastases being common. Surgical resection is the primary treatment, but only a minority of patients are eligible. This study evaluates minimally invasive interventional radiological techniques as alternatives.\n\nMethods: This randomised controlled trial was conducted at a tertiary care center. Participants included patients with colorectal cancer liver metastases who were ineligible for surgical resection. Randomisation was performed using a computer-generated sequence, with allocation concealment via sealed envelopes. The intervention group received portal vein embolization, radioembolization, or ablation, while the control group received standard chemotherapy. The primary outcome was the increase in future liver remnant volume (FLR) over 6 months. Blinding was applied to outcome assessors.\n\nResults: A total of 200 participants were randomised: 100 to the intervention group and 100 to the control group. Analysis was conducted on 98 participants in the intervention group and 97 in the control group using an intention-to-treat approach. The intervention group showed a significant increase in FLR (mean difference = 15%, 95% CI 10% to 20%; p < 0.001). Adverse events were mild, with 5% in the intervention group and 3% in the control group experiencing minor complications.\n\nInterpretation: Minimally invasive interventional techniques significantly improve FLR in patients with colorectal cancer liver metastases, offering a viable alternative to surgery.\n\nTrial registration: NCT01234567\n\nFunding: Supported by the National Cancer Institute.",
