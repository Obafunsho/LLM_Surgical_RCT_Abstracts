A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Collagenase Clostridium Histolyticum Injection for Adhesive Capsulitis\n\nBackground: Adhesive capsulitis management lacks evidence-based controlled trials. This study evaluates the efficacy of collagenase clostridium histolyticum (CCH) injections compared to physical therapy.\n\nMethods: In this randomised controlled trial, 60 patients with adhesive capsulitis were recruited based on restricted active ROM of at least 60° in the affected shoulder. Participants were randomised to receive a single injection of 0.5 mL placebo or 0.145, 0.29, or 0.58 mg CCH. Randomisation was computer-generated, and allocation was concealed. Blinding was applied to outcome assessors. The primary outcome was active forward flexion improvement at 30 days. Follow-up continued for up to 60 months. \n\nResults: A single CCH injection did not significantly improve active ROM, passive ROM, or pain scores compared to placebo. However, in a subsequent study, CCH at 0.58 mg/1 mL and 0.58 mg/2 mL showed greater improvement in active forward flexion compared to exercise alone (mean difference: 26° and 31°, p = 0.03 and p = 0.01, respectively). No adverse events were reported.\n\nInterpretation: Extraarticular CCH injections are well-tolerated and more effective than exercise therapy for adhesive capsulitis. Further FDA-regulated trials are needed.\n\nTrial registration: Not provided.\n\nFunding: Not disclosed.",
