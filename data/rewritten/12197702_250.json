A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial on the Nephrotoxic Effects of Sevoflurane\n\nBackground: Volatile anesthetics, particularly sevoflurane, are associated with significant renal adverse effects. This study investigates the nephrotoxic potential of sevoflurane compared to isoflurane.\n\nMethods: This randomised controlled trial was conducted in an intensive care unit setting. Participants were adults undergoing surgery requiring general anesthesia. The intervention group received sevoflurane, while the control group received isoflurane. The primary outcome was the incidence of acute kidney injury (AKI) within 48 hours post-surgery. Randomisation was computer-generated, and allocation was concealed using sealed envelopes. Blinding was applied to outcome assessors.\n\nResults: A total of 200 participants were randomised: 100 to the sevoflurane group and 100 to the isoflurane group, between January 2020 and June 2021. Analysis included 98 participants in the sevoflurane group and 97 in the isoflurane group, using an intention-to-treat approach. The incidence of AKI was higher in the sevoflurane group (37.5%) compared to the isoflurane group (10.7%), with a mean difference of 26.8% (95% CI 15.2 to 38.4; p = 0.001). Adverse events included nephrogenic diabetes insipidus in 7% of the sevoflurane group and 2% of the isoflurane group.\n\nTrial registration: NCT12345678\n\nFunding: This trial was funded by the National Institute of Health.",
