The study included unselected pregnant women from two public hospitals in Kilifi County. The index test, SpHb, was compared against the reference standard, Lab Hb, measured by a SYSMEX XN-330 automated hematology analyzer. Records from May 2021 to December 2022 with both SpHb and Lab Hb results were analyzed. Linear regression and Bland-Altman analysis were used to assess the correlation and agreement between the tests. \n\nResults: A total of 2,975 records from 2,203 unique participants were analyzed. Linear regression showed a weak positive correlation with a proportional bias of 0.44 (95% CI 0.41–0.47) and a constant of 7.59 (95% CI 7.30–7.87, p < 0.001). The median bias was 1.70 g/dl, with limits of agreement from −0.80 to 4.20. The sensitivity of SpHb in detecting anemia was 18.66%, with a specificity of 96.77%. The prevalence of anemia was 46.37%, with positive and negative predictive values of 83.33% and 57.92%, respectively. \n\nInterpretation: The Masimo Rad-67® Pulse CO-Oximeter® did not accurately identify anemia in pregnant women, with many cases missed. Its use in antenatal care settings is not recommended. The study highlights the need for further research into non-invasive devices for anemia screening in low-resource settings.",
