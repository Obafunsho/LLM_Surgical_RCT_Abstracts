A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Neuromuscular Blockade Antagonists in Surgical Patients\n\nBackground: Residual neuromuscular blockade (RNB) increases perioperative adverse events. This study evaluates the impact of neuromuscular blockade antagonists on postoperative complications and recovery quality.\n\nMethods: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of 35 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) involving 4275 patients and two retrospective studies with 49,642 participants. Participants were surgical patients requiring neuromuscular blockade reversal. The intervention was sugammadex, compared to neostigmine. The primary outcome was time to Train-of-Four ratio (TOFR) ≥ 0.9, measured postoperatively. Randomisation and allocation concealment methods were not specified. Blinding details were not provided.\n\nResults: Sugammadex facilitated faster RNB reversal than neostigmine, with a quicker TOFR ≥ 0.9 (standardized mean difference [SMD] −3.45; 95% confidence interval [CI], −4.42 to −2.48) and shorter extubation time (SMD −1.44; 95% CI, −2.02 to −0.85). Sugammadex also reduced postoperative complications, including nausea and vomiting (RR 0.64; 95% CI, 0.46 to 0.88), pulmonary complications (RR 0.62; 95% CI, 0.38 to 0.99), and bradycardia (RR 0.32; 95% CI, 0.20 to 0.50). Adverse events were not detailed.\n\nInterpretation: Sugammadex provides faster neuromuscular blockade reversal and reduces postoperative complications compared to neostigmine, but does not improve overall recovery quality.
