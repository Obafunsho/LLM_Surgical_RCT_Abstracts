This study compares endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) with open surgical repair (OSR) in patients fit for surgery and EVAR with best medical care in those unfit for surgery.\n\nMethods: This randomised controlled trial included participants from multiple centers, with eligibility based on fitness for surgery. Randomisation was performed using a computer-generated sequence with allocation concealment. Blinding was not applicable due to the nature of interventions. The primary outcome was short-term mortality, measured within 30 days post-intervention.\n\nResults: A total of 2790 participants were randomised: 1362 to EVAR and 1361 to OSR. Short-term mortality was significantly lower in the EVAR group (1.4% vs. 4.2%, OR 0.33, 95% CI 0.20 to 0.55; P < 0.0001). Intermediate and long-term mortality showed no significant differences. Reintervention rates were higher in the EVAR group (OR 1.98, 95% CI 1.12 to 3.51; P = 0.02). Pulmonary complications were more frequent in the OSR group (OR 0.36, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.75; P = 0.006).\n\nInterpretation: EVAR offers lower short-term mortality compared to OSR in fit individuals, but this advantage diminishes over time. Higher reintervention rates in EVAR warrant consideration. Trial registration: Not provided. Funding: Not disclosed.",
