A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of 5-ALA Dosing for Fluorescence-Guided Resection of Malignant Glioma\n\nBackground: This study investigates the dose-efficacy relationship of five-aminolevulinic acid (5-ALA) in fluorescence-guided resection of malignant glioma.\n\nMethods: Conducted as a double-blind, randomised controlled trial, 21 patients with suspected malignant glioma were recruited at a single center. Eligible participants were aged 18-75 years with a Karnofsky Performance Scale score of ≥70%. Patients were randomised to receive 0.2, 2, or 20 mg/kg of 5-ALA using block randomisation and allocation concealment via sealed envelopes. The primary outcome was the surgeon's intraoperative assessment of tumor fluorescence under violet-blue light. Blinding included patients, surgeons, and outcome assessors.\n\nResults: All 21 patients completed the study. The 20 mg/kg group exhibited the strongest fluorescence in tumor core and margins, correlating with cell density. No fluorescence was observed at 0.2 mg/kg. A 10-fold increase in dose resulted in a 4-fold increase in fluorescence contrast between marginal tumor and adjacent brain. The positive predictive value of fluorescence was 100%. Plasma analysis showed peak protoporphyrin IX (PPIX) levels at 7.83 hours for 20 mg/kg. No adverse events were reported.\n\nInterpretation: The 20 mg/kg dose of 5-ALA is most effective for fluorescence-guided resection, with no additional benefit from higher doses. The study supports the use of 20 mg/kg for optimal tumor visualization. Trial registration: NCT02755142. Funding: Sponsored by Medac, Hamburg, Germany.",
