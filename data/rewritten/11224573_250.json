A 250-word version\n\nTitle: EXPELLIARMUS: A Randomised Controlled Trial\n\nBackground: Early postoperative mobilization is advocated to reduce complications, but the efficacy of fitness trackers (FT) alone is unclear.\n\nMethods: This multicenter randomized controlled trial was conducted at 11 university hospitals in Germany. Patients aged ≥18 years undergoing major abdominal surgery were randomly assigned to the experimental group (FT with visible screen and step goals) or control group (FT with blackened screen). The primary outcome was postoperative morbidity within 30 days, measured by the Comprehensive Complication Index (CCI). Randomization was web-based with allocation concealment, and neither patients nor outcome assessors were blinded. A total of 347 patients were recruited between June 2019 and October 2021, with 174 in the experimental group and 173 in the control group. Analysis was intention-to-treat.\n\nResults: The mean CCI was 23±24 in the experimental group and 22±22 in the control group (95% CI: −6.1, 3.7; P=0.628). Secondary outcomes, including quality of recovery and step count, were comparable. Serious adverse events occurred in 20% of the experimental group and 25% of the control group (P=0.237). \n\nInterpretation: Daily step goals with FT-based feedback did not reduce postoperative morbidity. The trial demonstrates the feasibility of student-led randomized controlled trials in surgery.\n\nTrial registration: DRKS00016755.\n\nFunding: Conducted by the Student-Initiated German Medical Audit (SIGMA) study group.",
