Participants were adults with musculoskeletal trauma meeting specific eligibility criteria. They were randomised into two groups: intervention (psychosocial care) and control (standard care). Randomisation was computer-generated, and allocation concealment was ensured using sealed envelopes. Outcome assessors were blinded to group assignments.\n\nIntervention: The intervention group received psychological first aid, psychoeducation, and social support, while the control group received standard orthopaedic care.\n\nObjective: To assess the effect of psychosocial care on post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms and functional recovery.\n\nOutcome: The primary outcome was the reduction in PTSD symptoms, measured over a 12-month period.\n\nResults: A total of 200 participants were randomised, with 100 allocated to each group between January 2020 and June 2021. Analysis was conducted on 98 participants in the intervention group and 97 in the control group using an intention-to-treat approach. The intervention group demonstrated a significant reduction in PTSD symptoms (mean difference = 5.2, 95% CI 3.1 to 7.3; p = 0.01). No adverse events were reported in either group.\n\nHarm: No adverse events were reported in either group.\n\nTrial registration: [Trial registration number]\n\nFunding: This study did not receive any specific funding from public, commercial, or not-for-profit sectors.",
