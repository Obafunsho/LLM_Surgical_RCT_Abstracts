This study aimed to assess radiographic progression of degenerative joint disease, changes in pseudarthrosis height, and the association of degenerative changes with clinical outcomes.\n\nMethods: This randomised controlled trial included 54 participants with painful trapeziometacarpal joint osteoarthritis, randomised to simple trapeziectomy (n=25) or trapeziectomy with ligament reconstruction and tendon interposition (LRTI) (n=29). Randomisation was conducted using a computer-generated sequence with allocation concealment. Outcome assessors were blinded. Radiographic changes were evaluated using the Kellgren and Lawrence system, and clinical outcomes were measured using the Patient Evaluation Measure (PEM), Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) questionnaires, and thumb key pinch strength at 1-year and 6-year follow-ups.\n\nResults: At final follow-up, 7/25 simple trapeziectomy cases and 1/29 LRTI cases exhibited increased degenerative changes. Pseudarthrosis space was maintained in 22/25 simple trapeziectomies and 28/29 LRTI cases. No significant differences in PEM, DASH, or pinch strength were observed between groups. No adverse events were reported.\n\nInterpretation: Although simple trapeziectomy resulted in more degenerative changes, these did not affect clinical outcomes. The study was registered under trial number [insert number] and funded by [insert source]. The findings suggest that both surgical options are viable, with no significant difference in long-term clinical outcomes despite radiographic changes. Further research may explore the implications of these findings on surgical decision-making and patient care.",
