Patients were categorized into two groups: those receiving NSAIDs (NSAIDs group) and those not receiving NSAIDs (control group). Propensity score matching (PSM) was employed to reduce confounding bias. The primary outcome was the incidence of PPCs within 7 days post-surgery.\n\nResults: Of the 306 patients analyzed, 139 were in the NSAIDs group and 167 in the control group. Post-PSM, each group comprised 119 patients. The NSAIDs group exhibited significantly lower frequencies of postoperative pneumonia (5.9% vs. 13.4%, P=0.048) and respiratory failure (0.8% vs. 5.9%, P=0.03) compared to the control group. Additionally, the NSAIDs group had reduced intraoperative fentanyl equivalents, lower ICU admission rates (2.5% vs. 10.1%, P=0.02), and shorter postoperative hospital stays (median 5.0 days vs. 6.0 days, P=0.03). No significant differences in overall PPCs were observed between the groups (24.4% vs. 34.5%, P=0.09).\n\nInterpretation: The use of intraoperative NSAIDs was associated with a reduction in specific PPCs, ICU admissions, and hospital stay duration in NSCLC patients. These findings suggest that NSAIDs may offer benefits in surgical recovery, warranting further prospective studies.\n\nTrial registration: Not applicable.\n\nFunding: Not specified.",
