  "abstract": "1. A 250-word version\n\nBackground: Extramammary Paget's disease (EMPD) is a rare cutaneous neoplasm classified as primary or secondary based on the presence of an associated internal malignancy. This case report presents a unique instance of primary EMPD developing 10 years after secondary EMPD in the same location. Methods: This study was conducted as a case report, not a randomised controlled trial. The patient, a 75-year-old male, initially underwent wide local excision for secondary EMPD associated with urothelial carcinoma. Ten years later, he developed primary EMPD, confirmed through histopathological and immunohistochemical analysis. Results: The patient was treated with Mohs micrographic surgery (MMS), which demonstrated high precision in margin control and resulted in no recurrence over a one-year follow-up period. Interpretation: This rare occurrence raises questions about potential mechanisms, including field cancerization, persistent risk factors, or a coincidental event. The case underscores the importance of long-term follow-up and surveillance for EMPD patients. MMS remains the gold standard for treating EMPD due to its lower recurrence rates compared to conventional surgical methods. This case highlights the need for meticulous diagnostic approaches and continuous monitoring to manage and understand the complexities of EMPD effectively. No adverse events were reported. Trial registration: Not applicable. Funding: Not applicable.",
