The primary outcome was neurodevelopmental scores on the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development (BSID-III) at 12–24 months.\n\nResults: The study included 34 patients, with surgery performed at a median age of 7 days. Longer cross-clamp time was associated with poor language composite scores (p = 0.036). Severity of encephalopathy during the 24-hour post-operative period was significantly associated with poor language composite scores (p = 0.026). All neonates had below average cognitive, language, and motor composite scores on BSID-III. The study found a 100% rate of neurological abnormalities, with developmental delay and microcephaly being the most common.\n\nInterpretation: The findings suggest that longer cross-clamp time and severe encephalopathy during the 24-hour post-operative period are linked to poor language outcomes in neonates with CHD. These results underscore the importance of early identification and intervention for high-risk infants to improve neurodevelopmental outcomes. Further research is needed to explore the relationship between EEG findings and long-term outcomes in this population.",
