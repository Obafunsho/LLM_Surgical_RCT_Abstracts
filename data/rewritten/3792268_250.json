A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial Comparing Porous Tantalum Cementless and Cemented Tibial Components in Total Knee Arthroplasty\n\nBackground: This randomised controlled trial evaluates the clinical outcomes of porous tantalum cementless tibial components versus conventional cemented components in total knee arthroplasty (TKA).\n\nMethods: A total of 145 patients were randomised into two groups: Group 1 received a porous tantalum cementless tibial component, and Group 2 received a cemented conventional tibial component in posterior cruciate retaining TKA. Randomisation was performed using a computer-generated sequence with allocation concealment via sealed envelopes. The primary outcome was the Knee Society Score (KSS) and WOMAC Osteoarthritis Index, measured preoperatively and at 15 days, 6 months, and 5 years postoperatively. Blinding was applied to outcome assessors.\n\nResults: At 5-year follow-up, the mean KSS was 90.4 (95% CI, ±1.6) for Group 1 and 86.5 (95% CI, ±2.4) for Group 2, with an effect size of 3.88 ± 2.87. The mean WOMAC score was 15.1 (95% CI, ±2.6) for Group 1 and 19.1 (95% CI, ±2.9) for Group 2, with an effect size of -4.0 ± 3.9. No significant differences were observed in complications or aseptic loosening between groups.\n\nInterpretation: The study suggests minor differences in clinical outcomes between the two tibial components. The long-term cost-effectiveness and performance remain uncertain.\n\nTrial registration: [Trial registration number]\n\nFunding: [Source of funding]",
