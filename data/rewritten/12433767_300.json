A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Long-term Effectiveness of Fluoroscopy-Guided Foam Sclerotherapy for Varicose Veins: A Randomised Controlled Trial\n\nBackground: This study aimed to evaluate the long-term effectiveness of fluoroscopy-guided foam sclerotherapy for varicose veins in the legs.\n\nMethods: This randomised controlled trial was conducted at the authors' center from August 1, 2011, to May 31, 2016. Participants were consecutive patients with varicose veins in the legs. The primary outcome was the recurrence of varicose veins, defined as their presence regardless of symptoms, assessed at the last follow-up in May 2022. Randomisation and allocation concealment methods were not specified. Blinding details were not provided. The intervention involved fluoroscopy-guided foam sclerotherapy, with no comparator group mentioned.\n\nResults: A total of 94 patients (58.3 ± 7.8 years; 43 men; 119 legs) were included in the final analysis. The median CEAP clinical class was 3.0 (IQR: 3.0, 4.0). The recurrence rate was 30.9% (29/94), with 26.6% (25/94) for the great saphenous vein and 4.3% (4/94) for the small saphenous vein (P < .001). The median venous clinical severity score improved from 7.0 (IQR: 5.0, 8.0) at baseline to 2.0 (IQR: 1.0, 5.0) at follow-up (P < .001). Hyperpigmentation occurred in 11.8% (14/119) of legs. No stroke, deep vein thrombosis, or pulmonary embolism was reported. Five patients required subsequent surgical treatment, while others opted for conservative management. Among the two C5 legs at baseline, one ulcer recurred and healed with conservative treatment. All four C6 legs healed within a month.\n\nInterpretation: Fluoroscopy-guided foam sclerotherapy demonstrates satisfying long-term outcomes with minimal short-term safety concerns. Trial registration and funding details were not provided.",
