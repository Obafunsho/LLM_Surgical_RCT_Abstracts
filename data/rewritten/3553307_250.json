A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial on Factors Influencing Timing and Outcomes of Superior Cavopulmonary Anastomosis\n\nBackground: This study aimed to identify factors associated with the timing and surgical outcomes of the superior cavopulmonary anastomosis (SCPA) in infants with single ventricle physiology.\n\nMethods: Participants were identified from the Pediatric Heart Network’s Infant Single Ventricle trial database. Eligibility criteria included infants undergoing SCPA. The study was conducted across multiple centers. Factors such as demographics, cardiac anatomy, and intraoperative variables were evaluated. Age at SCPA was analyzed using Cox proportional hazards regression, and length of stay (LOS) was analyzed using multiple linear regression.\n\nResults: A total of 193 subjects underwent SCPA at a median age of 5.2 months and weight of 5.9 kg. Median LOS was 7 days. There were 3 deaths and 1 transplant during hospitalization, and 3 deaths and 3 transplants post-discharge. Age at SCPA was associated with center and interstage adverse events. Longer LOS was linked to younger age and greater case complexity. SCPA type and other cardiac variables were not independently associated with age or LOS.\n\nInterpretation: Greater case complexity and frequent interstage adverse events are linked to earlier SCPA. Variation in age at SCPA among centers suggests a lack of consensus on optimal timing. Understanding factors associated with LOS may improve pre-SCPA care and outcomes.",
