A 300-word version\n\nTitle: A Randomised Controlled Trial Comparing Kinematic and Mechanical Alignment in Total Knee Arthroplasty\n\nBackground: This randomised controlled trial evaluated whether kinematic alignment (KA) offers superior patient-reported outcomes compared to mechanical alignment (MA) in total knee arthroplasty (TKA).\n\nMethods: Ninety-nine primary TKAs in 95 patients were randomised to KA (n = 49) or MA (n = 50) groups. Participants were eligible if undergoing primary TKA, and the study was conducted at a single institution. In the KA group, patient-specific cutting blocks were created using preoperative MRI data, while the MA group used computer navigation for neutral alignment. The primary outcome was the Oxford Knee Score (OKS), assessed preoperatively and at 6 weeks, 6 months, 1 year, and 2 years postoperatively. Randomisation was computer-generated, and allocation was concealed. Blinding details were not specified. Sample size was calculated to detect a 5-point OKS difference with 80% power.\n\nResults: At 2 years, no significant difference was observed in OKS change scores between KA and MA groups (mean difference 1.0, 95% CI, −1.4 to 3.4, p = 0.4). Postoperative alignment showed the KA group had more varus tibial and valgus femoral components compared to the MA group. Complication rates were similar between groups, with no significant differences in adverse events.\n\nInterpretation: The study did not demonstrate a benefit of KA over MA in 2-year patient-reported outcomes for TKA. Although KA resulted in different component alignments, these did not lead to improved pain or function. The long-term impact of these alignment differences on TKA survivorship is unknown.\n\nTrial registration: Not provided. Funding: Not specified.",
