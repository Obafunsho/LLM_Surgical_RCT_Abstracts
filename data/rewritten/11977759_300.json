  "abstract": "Title: Randomised Controlled Trial of Preoperative Lugol Solution in Total Thyroidectomy for Graves’ Disease\n\nBackground: This randomised controlled trial evaluated the impact of preoperative Lugol solution on thyroid vascularization and surgical morbidity in patients with Graves’ disease undergoing total thyroidectomy.\n\nMethods: Conducted at Padua University Hospital, Italy, between February 2020 and April 2023, this single-centre, single-blinded trial involved 56 patients randomly assigned to receive 7 days of Lugol treatment (Lugol+ group, 29) or no Lugol treatment (Lugol− group, 27). The primary outcome was intraoperative and postoperative blood loss, assessed directly and indirectly. Secondary outcomes included duration of surgery, thyroid function, morbidity, vascularization, and microvessel density. Randomisation was performed using Sealed Envelope TM software, with allocation concealment. Outcome assessors and clinicians were blinded, but patients were not. A per-protocol analysis was used.\n\nResults: At T1, the Lugol+ group showed significant reductions in free tri-iodothyronine (FT3) and free thyroxine (FT4) levels compared to T0, with no such changes in the Lugol− group. No significant differences were observed between groups for intraoperative/postoperative blood loss (median 80 ml vs 94 ml), duration of surgery (75 min in both groups), or postoperative morbidity. No severe adverse events were reported, though 35 patients experienced a metallic taste, and 15 had difficulties obtaining the solution. The Lugol+ group had a higher rate of treatment discontinuation due to side effects.\n\nInterpretation: Preoperative Lugol solution effectively reduces FT3 and FT4 levels but does not impact blood loss, thyroid vascularization, or surgical morbidity.
