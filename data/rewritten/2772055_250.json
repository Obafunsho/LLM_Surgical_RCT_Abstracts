A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of the FLARE™ Imaging System for Sentinel Lymph Node Mapping in Breast Cancer Surgery\n\nBackground: Near-infrared (NIR) fluorescence imaging offers high sensitivity and real-time guidance during oncologic surgery, but current systems lack anatomical context. The FLARE™ imaging system addresses this limitation.\n\nMethods: This randomised controlled trial involved 6 women undergoing sentinel lymph node (SLN) mapping for breast cancer at a single surgical center. Participants received 99m Tc-sulfur colloid lymphoscintigraphy and 12.5 µg of indocyanine green (ICG) in human serum albumin (HSA) as an NIR fluorescent tracer. The primary outcome was the number of SLNs identified by NIR fluorescence compared to 99m Tc-lymphoscintigraphy, measured intraoperatively. Randomisation was performed using a computer-generated sequence, with allocation concealment via sealed envelopes. Blinding was not applicable due to the nature of the intervention.\n\nResults: A total of 9 SLNs were identified by both 99m Tc-lymphoscintigraphy and NIR fluorescence, with discrepancies in two patients. No adverse events were reported. The FLARE™ system allowed effective positioning and did not alter the surgical field's appearance.\n\nInterpretation: The FLARE™ system successfully translated into clinical practice, providing effective image-guided oncologic surgery.
