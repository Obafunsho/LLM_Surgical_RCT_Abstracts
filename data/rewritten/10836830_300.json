A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Probe-Based Near Infrared Autofluorescence for Parathyroid Identification\n\nBackground: Accurate intraoperative identification of parathyroid glands during parathyroidectomy is crucial yet challenging, often necessitating costly frozen sections. This study assesses the efficacy of probe-based near infrared autofluorescence (NIRAF) in enhancing parathyroid identification.\n\nMethods: Conducted at a single institution, this randomised controlled trial included patients undergoing parathyroidectomy for primary hyperparathyroidism. Participants were randomly assigned to either the probe-based NIRAF group or the control group. The primary outcome was the number of parathyroids identified with high confidence by the surgeon and resident, assessed intraoperatively. Randomisation was achieved using a computer-generated sequence, with allocation concealment via sealed envelopes. Due to the intervention's nature, blinding was not possible.\n\nResults: A total of 160 patients were randomised, with 80 in each group, between [Start Date] and [End Date]. In the probe group, the senior surgeon's identification rate improved significantly from 3.2 to 3.6 parathyroids per patient (p<0.001), while the junior surgeon's rate increased from 2.2 to 2.5 (p=0.001). Residents demonstrated a significant increase from 0.9 to 2.9 parathyroids per patient (p<0.001). The probe group required significantly fewer frozen sections (17 vs 47, p=0.005). No adverse events were reported in either group.\n\nInterpretation: Probe-based NIRAF serves as a valuable intraoperative adjunct, enhancing parathyroid identification and reducing the need for frozen sections. The trial was registered under [Trial Registration Number] and funded by [Funding Source]. Further research may explore its educational benefits for surgical trainees.",
