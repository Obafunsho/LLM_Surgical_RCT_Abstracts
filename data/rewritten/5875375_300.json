This study assesses the UW-IPASS standardized handoff curriculum's effect on communication and patient outcomes.\n\nMethods: Conducted from October 2015 to May 2016, this cluster randomized stepped-wedge trial involved eight intensive care units at two hospital systems within an academic tertiary referral center. Participants included 106 clinicians (residents, fellows, advance-practice clinicians, and attending physicians) across 1488 handoff events. The primary outcome was the perceived adequacy of interclinician communication, assessed over eight months. Randomization was by cluster, with allocation concealment not specified. Blinding was not applied.\n\nIntervention: The UW-IPASS curriculum was compared to standard handoff practices. The primary aim was to evaluate its impact on communication adequacy. Secondary outcomes included ICU length of stay, mechanical ventilation duration, reintubations, and order workflow patterns.\n\nResults: A total of 63 residents and advance practice clinicians, 13 fellows, and 30 attending physicians participated. During the control period, 10.2% of handoffs were reported as poor quality, compared to 7.2% during the UW-IPASS period (odds ratio, 0.19; 95% CI, 0.03-0.74; P = .03). The perceived duration of handoffs was unchanged. Early morning order entry decreased significantly in the intervention period. No significant changes were observed in ICU length of stay, mechanical ventilation duration, or reintubations.\n\nInterpretation: The UW-IPASS curriculum improved clinician preparedness and workflow, suggesting its potential to enhance communication and reduce errors. No adverse events were reported. Trial registration: ISRCTN14209509. Funding source not specified.",
