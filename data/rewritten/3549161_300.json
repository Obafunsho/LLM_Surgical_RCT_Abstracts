This study investigates the analgesic efficacy of parecoxib, a COX-2 antagonist, when added to ropivacaine in brachial plexus nerve blocks.\n\nMethods: A randomised controlled trial was conducted with 150 patients undergoing elective forearm surgery from January 2009 to November 2010. Participants were randomly allocated into three groups: Group A (n=50) received ropivacaine 0.25% alone, Group B (n=50) received ropivacaine with 20 mg parecoxib locally, and Group C (n=50) received 20 mg parecoxib intravenously. The primary outcome was the duration of sensory and motor blocks, assessed over a 24-hour postoperative period. Randomisation was computer-generated, and allocation was concealed. Outcome assessors were blinded to group assignments.\n\nResults: Group B demonstrated significantly prolonged motor and sensory block times compared to Group A (mean difference = X hours, 95% CI Y to Z; p < 0.05). Group C did not exhibit significant differences compared to Group A. Pain intensity scores in Group B were significantly lower than those in Groups A and C (mean difference = X, 95% CI Y to Z; p < 0.05). No adverse events were reported in any group.\n\nInterpretation: The addition of parecoxib to ropivacaine locally on the nerve block significantly prolongs the duration of brachial plexus blockade and reduces postoperative pain in patients undergoing forearm surgery. Trial registration: [Registration Number]. Funding: [Source of Funding]. This study supports the use of parecoxib as an effective analgesic adjuvant in regional anesthesia.",
