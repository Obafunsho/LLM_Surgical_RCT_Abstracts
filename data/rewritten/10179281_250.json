A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Patient-Controlled Epidural Analgesia vs. Continuous Epidural Analgesia in Surgical Patients\n\nBackground: The benefits of patient-controlled epidural analgesia (PCEA) over continuous epidural analgesia (CEA) in obstetric patients are established, but their applicability to surgical patients is uncertain.\n\nMethods: This systematic review included six randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing PCEA and CEA in adult surgical patients. The primary outcome was pain scores on postoperative day one (POD1). Secondary outcomes included total analgesic dose, systemic analgesics, manual top-ups, side effects, and patient satisfaction. The Cochrane risk-of-bias tool (RoB2) assessed study quality. The review was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42018106644).\n\nResults: A total of 480 participants were randomised across six RCTs. Two studies reported significantly reduced resting pain scores on POD1 with PCEA (36–44% reduction, p < 0.05). PCEA reduced epidural medication use by 28% to 40% (p < 0.01) in four studies. One study found a 23% reduction in top-ups (p < 0.001) and reduced intravenous morphine use (0.16 vs. 3.45 mg, p < 0.05) with PCEA. PCEA patients reported higher satisfaction (p < 0.001) in two studies. Nausea and vomiting were less frequent with PCEA (p = 0.01).\n\nInterpretation: PCEA did not significantly reduce pain scores compared to CEA. However, PCEA showed advantages in reducing epidural drug use, systemic analgesic requirements, and top-ups, while improving patient satisfaction. Further research should focus on composite postoperative comfort scores.\n\nTrial registration: PROSPERO CRD42018106644.\n\nFunding: Not specified.",
