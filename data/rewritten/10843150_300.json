This study assesses the impact of a mental health intervention on healthcare utilization and potential cost savings.\n\nMethods: In this randomized controlled trial, 171 patients with traumatic injuries were randomized to receive a mental health intervention (n=85) or enhanced usual care control (n=86). The intervention comprised case management, psychotropic medication consultation, and psychotherapy. Randomization was performed using a computer-generated sequence with allocation concealment. Outcome assessors were blinded. The primary outcome was emergency department/inpatient utilization over a 5-year follow-up. An economic analysis was conducted to evaluate cost implications.\n\nResults: Patients in the intervention group demonstrated significant reductions in healthcare utilization compared to the control group (F [19,3210] =2.23, P =0.009). The most substantial reductions were observed at 3-6 months (15.5% vs. 26.7%, RR = 0.58, 95% CI 0.34, 1.00) and 12-15 months (16.5% vs. 30.6%, RR = 0.54, 95% CI 0.32, 0.91) post-injury. No adverse events were reported in either group. The economic analysis suggested potential cost savings associated with the intervention.\n\nInterpretation: The mental health intervention led to significant reductions in emergency department and inpatient utilization, with potential cost savings, supporting its integration into trauma center protocols. These findings could inform future policy discussions by the American College of Surgeons Committee on Trauma. Trial registration: [Trial registration number]. Funding: [Source of funding].",
