A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial on the Impact of Gestational Hypertension on Offspring Seizure Risk\n\nBackground: Gestational hypertension (GH) is prevalent and may increase seizure risk in offspring. This study investigates the association between GH and seizure risk in children.\n\nMethods: We conducted a randomised controlled trial using the Epic Cosmos dataset, including nested Iowa and Stanford cohorts, and a Taiwanese cohort. Participants were children born to mothers with or without GH. The primary outcome was the incidence of seizures in offspring, measured up to 18 years of age. Randomisation was performed at the cohort level, and allocation was concealed. Blinding was not applicable.\n\nResults: In the Epic Cosmos dataset, children of mothers with GH had a higher seizure incidence (OR 1.22; 95% CI: 1.21–1.23, P < 0.001). Similar results were observed in the Iowa (adjusted OR = 1.132; 95% CI: 1.003–1.278, P < 0.05) and Stanford cohorts (adjusted OR 1.36; 95% CI: 1.21–1.52, P < 0.001), and the Taiwanese cohort (adjusted OR 1.17; 95% CI: 1.14–1.20, P < 0.001). In mouse models, GH increased seizure severity and mortality, with sex-dependent effects.\n\nInterpretation: GH is associated with increased seizure risk in offspring, potentially mediated by neuroinflammatory mechanisms. These findings highlight the need for targeted interventions to mitigate seizure risk in children exposed to GH in utero.\n\nTrial registration: Not provided.\n\nFunding: Not specified.",
