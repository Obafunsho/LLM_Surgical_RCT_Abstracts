This study investigates whether polyhexamethylene biguanide (PHMB)-impregnated gauze is more effective than plain gauze in reducing pin tract infections.\n\nMethods: In this randomised controlled trial, 38 patients (40 limbs) undergoing limb lengthening or deformity correction with external fixators were enrolled at a single center from July 2009 to June 2010. Participants were randomly assigned to the PHMB group (22 limbs) or the control group (18 limbs). The primary outcome was the rate of pin tract infection, evaluated at 2, 4, 8, and 12 weeks post-surgery using a predetermined grading system. Randomisation was conducted using a computer-generated sequence, and allocation was concealed. The outcome assessor was blinded to the type of gauze used.\n\nResults: A total of 1932 observations were recorded across 483 metal-skin interfaces. The infection rate was significantly lower in the PHMB group (1.0%) compared to the control group (4.5%), with a relative risk of 0.228 (95% CI, 0.118 to 0.443; p < 0.001). No adverse events were reported in either group, indicating the safety of the intervention.\n\nInterpretation: The use of PHMB-impregnated gauze significantly reduces the risk of pin tract infection in patients undergoing external fixation. This finding supports the adoption of PHMB-impregnated gauze as a standard practice to minimize infection rates in clinical settings.\n\nTrial registration: Not provided.\n\nFunding: Not disclosed.",
