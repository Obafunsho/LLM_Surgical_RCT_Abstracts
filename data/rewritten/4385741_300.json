A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Impact of Right Ventricular Dysfunction on Outcomes in CABG with or without SVR: A Randomised Controlled Trial\n\nBackground: This study investigates whether right ventricular (RV) dysfunction affects clinical outcomes in patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) with or without surgical ventricular reconstruction (SVR).\n\nMethods: In this randomised controlled trial, 1,000 patients with coronary artery disease, left ventricular ejection fraction ≤35%, and anterior dysfunction were randomised to undergo CABG or CABG + SVR. Baseline RV function was assessed in 866 patients using echocardiography. The primary endpoint was all-cause mortality or cardiovascular hospitalization over a median follow-up of 48 months. Randomisation was performed using a computer-generated sequence, and allocation was concealed. Blinding was not specified.\n\nResults: Of the 866 patients, 102 (12%) had mild RV dysfunction, and 78 (9%) had moderate or severe dysfunction. Moderate to severe RV dysfunction was associated with larger left ventricles, lower ejection fraction, more severe mitral regurgitation, higher filling pressure, and higher pulmonary artery systolic pressure (all p<0.0001). Patients with moderate or severe RV dysfunction who received CABG + SVR had significantly worse outcomes compared to those who received CABG alone for both the primary endpoint (HR=1.86; CI=1.06–3.26; p=0.028) and the secondary endpoint of all-cause mortality (HR=3.37; CI=1.36–8.37; p=0.005). The analysis was adjusted for prognostic factors, and the interaction remained significant (p=0.022).\n\nInterpretation: Adding SVR to CABG may worsen long-term survival in patients with moderate to severe RV dysfunction, indicating advanced LV remodeling. Adverse events were not reported. Trial registration and funding details were not provided.",
