A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Phase 2 Trial of Imlifidase for Desensitization in Kidney Transplantation\n\nBackground: Highly sensitized patients face significant challenges in kidney transplantation due to preformed donor-specific antibodies. This study evaluates the efficacy and safety of imlifidase in converting positive crossmatch tests to negative, thus enabling transplantation.\n\nMethods: This open-label, single-arm, phase 2 trial was conducted at five transplant centers (Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, The Johns Hopkins Hospital, New York University Langone Health, Uppsala University Hospital, Hôpital Necker) from September 30, 2016, to July 3, 2018. Adult patients with a median calculated panel-reactive antibody (cPRA) of 99.83% were enrolled. Imlifidase was administered intravenously to convert positive crossmatch tests to negative within 24 hours. The primary outcome was crossmatch conversion, with secondary outcomes including donor-specific antibody levels, renal function, and safety. No randomization or blinding was performed due to the study's single-arm design.\n\nResults: Of 19 enrolled patients, 18 received a full dose of imlifidase, with 89.5% achieving crossmatch conversion within 24 hours. Patient survival was 100%, and graft survival was 88.9% at 6 months. Early antibody-mediated rejection occurred in 38.9% of patients, with onset 2–19 days post-transplantation. Serum IgG levels began to normalize after 3–7 days post-transplantation. Seven adverse events in six patients were related to treatment, all mild to moderate.\n\nInterpretation: Imlifidase effectively converted positive crossmatches to negative, facilitating transplantation in highly sensitized patients. The treatment was well tolerated, with promising short-term outcomes, although antibody-mediated rejection remains a concern.\n\nTrial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02790437.\n\nFunding: The study was funded by Hansa Biopharma AB.",
