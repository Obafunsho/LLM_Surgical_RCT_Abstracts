Infants with CHD who underwent surgery by 44 weeks gestational age and had cEEG monitoring were included. The primary outcome was neurodevelopmental scores on the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development (BSID-III) at 12–24 months.\n\nResults: A total of 34 patients were included, with surgery performed at a median age of 7 days. Longer cross-clamp time was associated with poor language composite scores (p = 0.036). Severity of encephalopathy during the 24-hour post-operative period was significantly associated with poor language composite scores (p = 0.026). All neonates had below average cognitive, language, and motor composite scores on BSID-III.\n\nInterpretation: The study highlights that longer cross-clamp time and severe encephalopathy during the 24-hour post-operative period are associated with poor language outcomes in neonates with CHD. Early identification of high-risk infants is crucial for targeted interventions to improve neurodevelopmental outcomes.",
