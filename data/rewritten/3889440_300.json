This study investigates the efficacy of intraarticular fibrinogen in reducing bleeding and transfusion needs post-TKA.\n\nMethods: A double-blind, randomised controlled trial was conducted with 200 patients undergoing TKA for osteoarthritis. Participants were randomised to receive intraarticular fibrinogen or no treatment before tourniquet release. The primary outcome was postoperative blood loss, assessed by drain output and hemoglobin drop at Day 2. Secondary outcomes included transfusion requirements, early clinical results, and complications. Randomisation was computer-generated, with allocation concealment. Blinding included patients, clinicians, and outcome assessors. Recruitment spanned January 2020 to June 2021.\n\nResults: 100 patients were allocated to each group, with analysis conducted on an intention-to-treat basis. No significant difference in calculated blood loss was found between the fibrinogen and control groups. Mean drain output was 780 ± 378 mL in the fibrinogen group versus 673 ± 301 mL in the control group (p = 0.029). Hemoglobin drop was 3.47 ± 1.53 g/L in the fibrinogen group compared to 3.84 ± 1.24 g/L in the control group (p = 0.051). No significant differences were observed in transfusion rates, early range of motion, pain scores, or complication rates. Adverse events were comparable between groups.\n\nInterpretation: The use of intraarticular fibrinogen in primary TKA for osteoarthritis did not significantly reduce blood loss or transfusion requirements. Given the absence of clinical benefits and the associated costs, routine use of fibrinogen in this context is not recommended.\n\nTrial registration: [Trial registration number]\n\nFunding: [Source of funding]",
