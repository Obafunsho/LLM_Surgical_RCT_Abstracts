A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of a Nomogram for Predicting Spread Through Air Spaces in Stage IA Lung Adenocarcinoma\n\nBackground: This study aimed to develop a preoperative prediction model for Spread Through Air Spaces (STAS) in stage IA lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) to guide surgical decision-making.\n\nMethods: A retrospective analysis was conducted on 1,375 patients with stage IA LUAD at Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center. Propensity score matching (PSM) matched 141 STAS-positive patients with 282 STAS-negative patients. Multivariate logistic regression identified independent risk factors among 16 clinicopathological and 13 CT imaging characteristics. A nomogram was developed and evaluated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) and decision curve analyses (DCAs).\n\nResults: Irregular nodule shape (OR = 1.817, 95% CI: 1.106–2.986, p = 0.018), irregular margin (OR = 2.050, 95% CI: 1.218–3.449, p = 0.007), lobulation (OR = 2.235, 95% CI: 1.336–3.739, p = 0.002), and vascular convergence (OR = 5.032, 95% CI: 2.050–12.349, p < 0.001) were significantly associated with increased STAS risk. The nomogram demonstrated good predictive accuracy (AUC = 0.812, 95% CI: 0.761–0.863) with a sensitivity of 69.5% and specificity of 80.2%.\n\nInterpretation: The nomogram effectively predicts STAS preoperatively, aiding in surgical decision-making for stage IA LUAD patients. No adverse events were reported. The study was conducted between December 2020 and October 2022. Trial registration: Not applicable. Funding: Not specified.",
