A 300-word version\n\nTitle: The Carotid Revascularization, Endarterectomy vs. Stenting Trial (CREST): A Randomised Controlled Trial\n\nBackground: The CREST trial evaluates the efficacy of carotid artery stenting (CAS) compared to carotid endarterectomy (CEA) in patients with carotid artery stenosis.\n\nMethods: This randomised controlled trial enrolled 2,522 participants from 117 centers in North America. Eligible participants included those with symptomatic carotid stenosis (≥50% by angiography, ≥70% by ultrasound) or asymptomatic stenosis (≥60% by angiography, ≥70% by ultrasound). Participants were randomised in a 1:1 ratio to receive either CAS or CEA. The primary outcome was a composite of stroke, myocardial infarction, and all-cause mortality during a 30-day peri-procedural period, and ipsilateral stroke over a follow-up period of up to 4 years. Randomisation was computer-generated, with allocation concealment ensured. Blinding details were not specified.\n\nResults: A total of 1,261 participants were randomised to each treatment group. The analysis approach was not specified. The primary outcome's effect size, precision, and adverse events were not detailed in the abstract.\n\nInterpretation: CREST is the largest trial to date comparing CAS and CEA, aiming to provide comprehensive data on their efficacy in preventing major cardiovascular events. The trial's extensive sample size and rigorous credentialing process for participating surgeons and interventionalists enhance its validity. The results will inform clinical decision-making for carotid revascularization. Trial registration: Not provided.
