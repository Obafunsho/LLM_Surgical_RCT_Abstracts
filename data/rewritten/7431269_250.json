A 250-word version\n\nTitle: A Randomised Controlled Trial of Bicruciate-Retaining versus Cruciate-Retaining Total Knee Arthroplasty\n\nBackground: Bicruciate-retaining total knee arthroplasty (TKA) aims to improve outcomes by preserving anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) function. However, its unique tibial component design may compromise fixation. This study evaluates tibial component migration and patient-reported outcomes.\n\nMethods: In this parallel-group trial (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT01966848), 50 patients with intact ACLs undergoing TKA were randomised to receive either bicruciate-retaining or cruciate-retaining TKA. The primary outcome was maximum total point motion (MTPM) of the tibial component at 2 years, measured by radiostereometric analysis (RSA). Secondary outcomes included Oxford Knee Score (OKS) and Forgotten Joint Score (FJS). Randomisation was computer-generated, and patients were blinded to allocation. The study was powered to detect a 0.2-mm difference in MTPM (SD = 0.2, significance level = 5%, power = 80%).\n\nResults: At 2 years, 22 bicruciate-retaining and 23 cruciate-retaining patients were analysed. No significant difference in MTPM was found (median MTPM: 0.52 mm vs. 0.42 mm, p = 0.63). OKS and FJS improvements were similar between groups. Three bicruciate-retaining patients required arthroscopic manipulation, and one had a tibial fracture requiring revision. No reoperations occurred in the cruciate-retaining group.\n\nInterpretation: No differences in tibial fixation or patient-reported outcomes were observed between groups. The bicruciate-retaining device showed a learning curve and potential risks without demonstrated benefits, suggesting it should not be routinely used. Further research should be conducted in controlled trials.\n\nFunding: Not specified.",
