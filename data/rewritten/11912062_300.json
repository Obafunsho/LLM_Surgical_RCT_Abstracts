This study aims to examine the clinical characteristics of bladder cancer patients with a history of prior malignancies and develop a prognostic model using SEER database data.\n\nMethods: This retrospective study analyzed data from bladder cancer patients diagnosed between 2011 and 2015, extracted using SEER*Stat software. Statistical analyses, including Kaplan-Meier survival curves and Cox regression, were conducted to develop a nomogram model. The primary outcome was overall survival, measured from diagnosis to death. The predictive performance of the nomogram was evaluated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) and the concordance index (C-index).\n\nResults: A total of 12,260 bladder cancer patients were analyzed, including 8,959 with no prior tumor history and 3,301 with a history of previous tumors. The mean survival duration for patients with a prior tumor history was 56.04 months, significantly lower than 70.28 months for those without (P<0.001). Significant differences were observed between the two groups across various clinical characteristics, such as age, race, gender, marital status, tumor location, tumor stage, and tumor grade. Multifactorial analysis identified age, race, gender, marital status, tumor grade, tumor stage, tumor histological type, surgical intervention, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and prior tumor history as independent prognostic factors. The nomogram demonstrated robust predictive performance with a C-index and AUC exceeding 0.70.\n\nInterpretation: Patients with a history of tumors exhibited lower survival rates and distinct clinical characteristics. The developed nomogram accurately predicts overall mortality and 3- and 5-year survival rates, offering potential for personalized prognostic assessments in clinical practice. Future research should validate the model’s generalizability and include additional biological factors to enhance its predictive power.",
