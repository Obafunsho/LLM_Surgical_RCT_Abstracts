This study evaluates the impact of the UW-IPASS standardized handoff curriculum on communication and patient outcomes.\n\nMethods: This cluster randomized stepped-wedge trial was conducted from October 2015 to May 2016 across eight intensive care units at two hospital systems within an academic tertiary referral center. Participants included 106 clinicians (residents, fellows, advance-practice clinicians, and attending physicians) involved in 1488 handoff events. The primary outcome was the perceived adequacy of interclinician communication, measured over eight months. Randomization was by cluster, with allocation concealment not specified. Blinding was not applied.\n\nResults: A total of 63 residents and advance practice clinicians, 13 fellows, and 30 attending physicians participated. During the control period, 10.2% of handoffs were reported as poor quality, compared to 7.2% during the UW-IPASS period (odds ratio, 0.19; 95% CI, 0.03-0.74; P = .03). Early morning order entry decreased significantly in the intervention period. No significant changes were observed in ICU length of stay, mechanical ventilation duration, or reintubations.\n\nInterpretation: The UW-IPASS curriculum improved clinician preparedness and workflow, highlighting its potential to enhance communication and reduce errors. No adverse events were reported. Trial registration: ISRCTN14209509. Funding source not specified.",
