The primary outcome was the patients' preferred communication framework. Randomisation was computer-generated, and allocation was concealed. Both patients and outcome assessors were blinded to the intervention.\n\nResults: Of the 66 randomised, 58 completed the study (mean age 55.8±13.8 years, 60.3% male). 22 patients (37.9%, 95%CI:25.4%−50.4%) preferred the BC/WC framework, 21 (36.2%, 95%CI:23.8%−48.6%) preferred the R/B framework, and 15 (25.9%, 95%CI:14.6%−37.2%) had no preference. High trust in the medical profession was inversely associated with a preference for BC/WC (OR 0.83, 95%CI 0.70–0.98, p=0.03). BC/WC rated higher for perceived listening (4.6±0.7 vs. 4.3±0.9, p=0.03) and trustworthiness (4.3±0.8 vs. 4.0±0.9, p=0.04). No adverse events were reported.\n\nInterpretation: The BC/WC framework was as acceptable as the R/B framework and rated higher in certain communication aspects. Surgeons should consider using BC/WC to tailor discussions. Trial registration: [Trial registration number]. Funding: [Source of funding].",
