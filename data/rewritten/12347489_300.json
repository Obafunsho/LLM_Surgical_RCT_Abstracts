A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of the Dor Procedure with Intraoperative Substrate Mapping for Refractory Ventricular Tachycardia\n\nBackground: This study assessed the efficacy of the Dor procedure combined with intraoperative substrate mapping and ablation in patients with left ventricular (LV) aneurysms and refractory ventricular tachycardia (VT).\n\nMethods: Conducted at a tertiary care center, this randomised controlled trial included patients with drug-resistant recurrent VT and LV aneurysms. Participants were randomised to receive either the Dor procedure with intraoperative substrate mapping and ablation or standard care. The primary outcome was VT recurrence, evaluated over a 28-month follow-up period. Randomisation was achieved using a computer-generated sequence, with allocation concealment via sealed envelopes. Due to the nature of the intervention, blinding was not feasible.\n\nResults: Two participants were randomised, with one in each group. Both participants were analysed per protocol. The intervention group demonstrated no VT recurrence at 28 months, while the control group experienced VT recurrence. Postoperative improvements in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) were observed in both groups, with no major complications reported.\n\nInterpretation: The Dor procedure combined with intraoperative substrate mapping and ablation may effectively reduce VT recurrence in patients with LV aneurysms. The procedure also showed potential benefits in improving LVEF. However, the small sample size limits the generalizability of the findings. Further research with larger cohorts is necessary to validate these results and explore the long-term impact on patient outcomes.\n\nTrial registration: Not provided.\n\nFunding: Not reported.",
