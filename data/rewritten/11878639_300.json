A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Genetically Modified Mesenchymal Stromal Cells Overexpressing VEGF for Critical Limb Ischemia\n\nBackground: Critical limb ischemia (CLI) is a severe form of peripheral artery disease with high amputation risk. Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) have been explored for CLI treatment but often lack efficacy. This study investigates the safety and efficacy of MSCs genetically modified to overexpress Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF-A165).\n\nMethods: Conducted in immune-deficient NSG mice, this preclinical study compared MSCs overexpressing VEGF (MSC/VEGF) with unmodified MSCs. The primary outcome was angiogenesis, evaluated using a Matrigel plug model over 6 months. Randomisation was achieved through a computer-generated sequence, with allocation concealment. Outcome assessors were blinded to group assignments.\n\nResults: Forty mice were randomised, with 20 receiving MSC/VEGF and 20 receiving unmodified MSCs. Per-protocol analysis revealed that MSC/VEGF significantly enhanced angiogenesis compared to controls, with increased vascular structures (p < 0.05). Adverse events included mild to large intramuscular hematomas at the injection site in 15% of mice, but no systemic pathology was detected. Two mice did not complete the study due to unrelated mortality, and no significant differences in body weight or clinical signs were observed between groups.\n\nInterpretation: MSC/VEGF demonstrates enhanced angiogenic potential and a favorable safety profile, suggesting its promise as a therapeutic for CLI. These results support the progression to a first-in-human clinical trial to further evaluate this novel cell/gene therapy.\n\nTrial registration: Not applicable.\n\nFunding: The study was supported by internal institutional grants.",
