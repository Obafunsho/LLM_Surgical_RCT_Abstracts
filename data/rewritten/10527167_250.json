PRO-CTCAE assessments were completed at baseline, on day 1 of each chemotherapy cycle, and daily during radiotherapy. Randomisation was performed using a computer-generated sequence, and allocation was concealed. Blinding was not specified.\n\nResults: Of 126 patients, 96 initiated treatment and completed a baseline plus at least one post-baseline PRO-CTCAE assessment. Diarrhea and fatigue were the only symptomatic grade 3 or higher AEs identified in at least 10% of patients using CTCAE. At least 10% of patients reported an adjusted PRO-CTCAE composite grade 3 AE for 10 of 15 items. Decreased appetite was higher in Arm 2 than in Arm 1 (P = 0.0497).\n\nInterpretation: Symptomatic AEs during neoadjuvant therapy were common and more frequently reported by patients using PRO-CTCAE than by clinicians using standard CTCAE.
