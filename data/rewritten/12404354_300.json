A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Chemical Biomarkers in Post-Amputation Healing\n\nBackground: Poor post-amputation healing delays prosthetic fitting, adversely affecting mortality, quality of life, and cardiovascular health. Current assessments lack standardization, emphasizing the need for objective biomarkers to improve healing evaluation.\n\nMethods: This scoping review adhered to JBI and PRISMA-ScR guidelines. Searches using “biomarkers,” “wound healing,” and “amputation” were performed across Web of Science, Ovid Medline, Ovid Embase, Scopus, Cochrane, PubMed, and CINAHL databases. Inclusion criteria were references to chemical biomarkers, residuum tissue healing, and ethical approval. Articles were evaluated for quality and evidence level, categorized by study type, wound type, and model. Repeated chemical biomarkers and quantification methods were reported.\n\nResults: From 3,306 screened titles and abstracts, 646 underwent full-text review, and 203 met criteria for data extraction, with 76% classified as strong quality. Thirty-eight chemical biomarkers were identified across 4 to 50 sources, with interleukins and HbA1c most prevalent, appearing in 50 and 48 sources, respectively. Other biomarkers included predictive blood markers, indicative growth factors, bacteria presence, proteins, and cellular markers.\n\nInterpretation: Predictive biomarkers identify comorbidities that may hinder healing, aiding in pre-amputation risk assessment. Indicative biomarkers monitor key biological healing processes, such as angiogenesis, wound contraction, and inflammation. Diagnostic biomarkers provide direct insights into tissue composition and cellular-level healing. Integrating these biomarkers into post-amputation assessments enables continuous monitoring of the healing process while accounting for comorbidities, enhancing the objectivity of post-surgical healing management and ensuring more effective, personalized rehabilitation strategies.",
