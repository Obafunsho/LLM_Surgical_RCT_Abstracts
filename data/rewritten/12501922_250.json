A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial on Preventive Factors in Free Flap Surgery for Head and Neck Reconstruction\n\nBackground: This randomised controlled trial aimed to identify factors preventing complications in free flap surgery for head and neck reconstruction to support clinical decision-making.\n\nMethods: Conducted at a tertiary referral center from 2019 to 2022, the study included 110 patients who underwent free flap reconstructions. Participants were selected based on eligibility criteria, excluding those with missing outcome data. The primary outcome was complication-free survival (CFS) at 30 days. Randomisation and allocation concealment methods were not applicable due to the retrospective nature of the study. Blinding was not implemented.\n\nResults: Of 125 identified cases, 110 were analysed. The median age was 66 years, with 71.8% male participants. Common complications included wound healing disorders (10.9%), hematoma (10%), and flap necrosis (9.1%). The 30-day CFS was 63%. Multivariable analysis identified female gender (HR: 9.4, CI: 2.6–33.5), alcohol abuse (HR: 3.5, CI: 1.4–8.4), and obesity (HR: 2.1, CI: 0.9–5.1) as significant risk factors. Positive factors increasing CFS included high albumin (OR 0.21, p = 0.02), intraoperative heparin bolus (OR 0.15, p = 0.08), and catecholamine treatment (OR 0.15, p = 0.009).\n\nInterpretation: Key preventive measures against complications include optimizing nutritional status, administering intraoperative heparin and catecholamines, and abstaining from alcohol. Females should be screened for cardiovascular risks. No adverse events were reported. Trial registration: Not applicable. Funding: Not specified.",
