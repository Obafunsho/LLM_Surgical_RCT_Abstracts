A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Carotid Endarterectomy and Carotid Artery Stenting on Dementia Risk in Asymptomatic Extracranial Carotid Artery Disease\n\nBackground: Asymptomatic extracranial carotid artery disease (aECAD) is associated with increased risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and non-AD dementia. This study investigates the effects of carotid endarterectomy (CEA) and carotid artery stenting (CAS) on dementia incidence.\n\nMethods: This retrospective cohort study utilized United States-based insurance claims data from 2010 to 2022, identifying 487,676 patients with aECAD. Propensity score matching was employed to balance demographic and comorbidity characteristics between patients undergoing CEA or CAS and those untreated. The primary outcome was the incidence of AD, measured over a mean follow-up of 8.34 years. The study was conducted without randomisation or blinding.\n\nResults: After matching, 37,317 patients underwent CEA or CAS. CEA was associated with a significantly lower AD risk (relative risk = 0.93; 95% confidence interval, 0.86–0.99; P = 0.04), whereas CAS was associated with a slight but non-significant increase in AD risk (relative risk = 1.05; 95% confidence interval, 0.88–1.26; P = 0.56). Similar trends were observed for non-AD dementia, with CEA showing a reduced risk (relative risk = 0.95; 95% confidence interval, 0.92–0.99; P = 0.02) and CAS showing an increased risk (relative risk = 1.10; 95% confidence interval, 0.88–1.26; P = 0.05).\n\nInterpretation: CEA, but not CAS, may confer a protective effect against AD and non-AD dementia in patients with aECAD. No adverse events were reported. The study was not registered as a clinical trial. Funding sources were not disclosed. These findings highlight the need to consider cognitive outcomes in the management of aECAD.",
