A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Prehabilitation in Esophagogastric Cancer Surgery\n\nBackground: Maintaining functional capacity is vital for patients with esophagogastric cancer. This study investigates the impact of prehabilitation on functional status in these patients.\n\nMethods: Conducted at McGill University Health Centre, Montreal, Canada, this randomised clinical trial included adults scheduled for elective esophagogastric cancer resection. Participants were randomised to either a prehabilitation group, receiving preoperative exercise and nutrition optimization, or a control group receiving standard care. The primary outcome was the change in functional capacity, measured by the 6-minute walk distance (6MWD), assessed preoperatively and 4 to 8 weeks postoperatively. Sixty-eight patients were randomised, with 51 included in the primary analysis. Randomisation was computer-generated, and allocation was concealed. Outcome assessors were blinded to group assignments.\n\nResults: The prehabilitation group demonstrated significant improvement in functional capacity compared to the control group both preoperatively (mean 6MWD change, 36.9 m vs −22.8 m; P < .001) and postoperatively (mean 6MWD change, 15.4 m vs −81.8 m; P < .001). No adverse events were reported in either group.\n\nInterpretation: Prehabilitation significantly improves perioperative functional capacity in patients undergoing esophagogastric surgery, suggesting a beneficial role in the cancer care continuum.
