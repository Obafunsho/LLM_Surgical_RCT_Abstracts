This study aimed to compare tibial bone density changes in cemented TKA components with different bearing designs.\n\nMethods: In this randomised controlled trial, 54 participants were randomised to receive either rotating-platform (n=28) or fixed-platform (n=26) cemented TKA. The study was conducted at [study setting]. Eligibility criteria included [participant eligibility criteria]. Bone density changes were assessed using quantitative computed tomography (qCT)-assisted osteodensitometry. The nonoperated contralateral side served as a control. CT scans were performed postoperatively and at 1 and 2 years. Randomisation was achieved using [randomisation method] with allocation concealment via [allocation concealment method]. Blinding was applied to [outcome assessors/patients/clinicians].\n\nResults: Cancellous bone density loss was observed in all proximal tibial regions in both cohorts, with a maximum loss of 12.6% at 2 years. Cortical bone density loss was lower, with a maximum of 3.6% at 2 years. No significant differences in bone loss were found between the fixed- and rotating-platform implants. The analysis was conducted using [analysis approach]. No adverse events were reported. The effect size for cancellous bone density loss was [effect size], 95% CI [confidence interval]; p = [p-value].\n\nInterpretation: The decrease in cancellous bone density after TKA suggests stress transfer to the cortical bone. These findings highlight the need for further research to explore the clinical implications and potential strategies to mitigate bone loss.\n\nTrial registration: [Trial registration number]\n\nFunding: [Source of funding]",
