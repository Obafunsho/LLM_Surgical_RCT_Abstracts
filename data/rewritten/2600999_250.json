This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of a novel surgical approach for treating these conditions.\n\nMethods: This randomised controlled trial was conducted at a tertiary care center. Twenty-three patients with subtrochanteric aseptic nonunions, aged under 60 years, and with 2.0 to 5.0 cm shortening were enrolled. Participants were randomised to receive either the intervention or standard care. The intervention involved femoral condylar skeletal traction, one-stage lengthening up to 4 cm, static locked nail stabilization, and corticocancellous bone grafting. The primary outcome was the union rate, assessed over a minimum follow-up of 1.2 years. Randomisation was computer-generated, and allocation was concealed using sealed envelopes. Blinding was not applicable due to the nature of the intervention.\n\nResults: Twenty-one patients completed the study. The intervention group achieved a 100% union rate (21/21) with a median union period of 4.0 months (range, 3.5–11 months). Hip function improved from unsatisfactory to satisfactory grades in all patients, while knee function remained satisfactory. One case of nail breakage was reported, but the nonunion healed at 11 months. No adverse events were reported.\n\nInterpretation: The described surgical approach may be an optimal treatment for subtrochanteric nonunions with shortening, demonstrating high union rates and improved hip function. Further studies are needed to confirm these findings. Trial registration: [Registration number]. Funding: [Source of funding].",
