This study aimed to develop and validate prognostic models to predict inpatient death, 24-hour discharge, and one-month readmission in patients admitted for hypoglycaemia.\n\nMethods: Data from the Hospital Episode Statistics database, covering admissions to NHS hospital trusts in England from 2010 to 2014, were used. Two prognostic models were developed and validated: a 'base' model including age, sex, ethnicity, region, social deprivation, and Charlson score, and a 'disease' model adding 20 common medical conditions. Model performance was assessed using C-index and calibration plots.\n\nResults: In derivation samples, 296 out of 11,136 admissions resulted in inpatient death, 1789/33,825 in one-month readmission, and 8396/33,803 in 24-hour discharge. Validation samples showed similar results. C-indices for the base and disease models were 0.77 and 0.78 for death, 0.57 for one-month readmission, and 0.68 and 0.69 for 24-hour discharge. Calibration plots indicated good agreement for inpatient death and 24-hour discharge. The models showed similar discrimination in both derivation and validation samples, with good calibration for inpatient death and 24-hour discharge.\n\nInterpretation: The developed models effectively predict inpatient death and 24-hour discharge, offering a pragmatic tool for improving patient outcomes and resource allocation. However, models for one-month readmission require further refinement. This tool can aid clinicians in personalizing treatment strategies and optimizing healthcare resources. Further studies are needed to validate these models and explore additional factors influencing one-month readmission.",
