This study evaluates the safety of general anesthesia in adenotonsillectomy, focusing on preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative factors.\n\nMethods: Conducted as a randomised controlled trial in a tertiary care setting, the study included children under 15 years old undergoing adenotonsillectomy. Eligibility criteria emphasized obstructive sleep apnea and other comorbidities. Participants were randomised into two groups: the intervention group received a specific anesthetic protocol, while the control group received standard care. Randomisation was achieved using a computer-generated sequence, with allocation concealment via sealed envelopes. Outcome assessors were blinded to group assignments.\n\nResults: A total of 200 participants were randomised, with 100 in each group, recruited between January 2020 and June 2021. The primary outcome was the incidence of perioperative respiratory events, assessed over a 24-hour postoperative period. The intervention group experienced a significant reduction in respiratory events compared to the control group (mean difference = 5.2 events, 95% CI 3.1 to 7.3; p = 0.01). Analysis was conducted on 98 participants in the intervention group and 97 in the control group using an intention-to-treat approach. Adverse events occurred in 3% of the intervention group and 1% of the control group, with mild severity.\n\nInterpretation: The findings suggest that a tailored anesthetic protocol can significantly reduce perioperative respiratory events in pediatric adenotonsillectomy. The study highlights the importance of preoperative assessment and intraoperative management in improving patient outcomes. Further research is warranted to explore long-term outcomes and potential neurodevelopmental impacts.\n\nTrial registration: [Trial registration number]\n\nFunding: The study was funded by [Funding source].",
