This study evaluates an innovative RCA technique using Ion Exchange Resin (i-ER) for high blood flow (500 mL/min) extracorporeal circuits.\n\nMethods: Six healthy swine (41.0 ± 3.1 kg) were sedated, ventilated, and connected to a prototype extracorporeal circuit. Sodium citrate (5 mmol/L) was infused at the circuit inlet, and heparin was continuously infused. Citrate concentration and Kaolin Heparinase thromboelastography (KH-TEG) were measured at baseline, 2, 8, 15, 30, 45, 60, 90, and 120 min. Calcium chloride was infused to maintain systemic ionized calcium. The primary outcome was the efficacy of i-ER in maintaining anticoagulation, measured over 2 hours.\n\nResults: KH-TEG in the artery showed normal coagulation (R = 8.30[6.80–10.10] min, MA = 71.70[67.90–77.00] mm), while the extracorporeal circuit showed no clot formation (R > 60 min, MA = 0 mm). Citrate removal efficacy decreased from 93.8 ± 3.4% to 48.3 ± 1.5% over 2 hours (p < 0.001). No significant complications were observed. The study demonstrated that i-ER-based RCA effectively reduced ionized calcium concentrations, providing complete anticoagulation without systemic effects during the first hour.\n\nInterpretation: i-ER-based RCA is feasible and effective for regional anticoagulation in high blood flow circuits for 60 minutes. The technique offers potential advantages, including avoiding systemic anticoagulation complications and overcoming citrate clearance limitations. Further studies are needed to evaluate long-term applications and effects on systemic and extracorporeal circuits.\n\nTrial registration: Not provided.\n\nFunding: Not specified.",
