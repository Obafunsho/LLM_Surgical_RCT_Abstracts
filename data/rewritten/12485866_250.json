A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Fluorescence Angiography in Colorectal Surgery\n\nBackground: Anastomotic leak is a significant complication in colorectal surgery, with rates of 8.1% in right colectomies and up to 17.1% in low anterior resections. This study evaluates the effect of fluorescence angiography on anastomotic leak and postoperative morbidity.\n\nMethods: A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials were conducted. Eligible studies compared fluorescence angiography with standard care. The primary outcome was the rate of anastomotic leak, measured within 30 to 90 days post-surgery. Randomisation methods and allocation concealment were not specified. Blinding details were not provided.\n\nResults: From 477 identified studies, 8 were included, involving 3999 patients. Fluorescence angiography significantly reduced anastomotic leak rates with an odds ratio of 0.64 (95% CI: 0.39–0.98, p < 0.0001) and a risk reduction of 4 percentage points. In colorectal anastomosis, the effect was maintained (OR 0.59, 95% CI 0.44–0.79, p < 0.0005). No significant reduction in postoperative morbidity was observed. Adverse events were not reported.\n\nInterpretation: Fluorescence angiography effectively reduces anastomotic leak rates in colorectal surgery but does not significantly impact postoperative morbidity. Further trials are needed to confirm these findings.\n\nTrial registration: Prospero 1055070.\n\nFunding: No funding was reported.",
