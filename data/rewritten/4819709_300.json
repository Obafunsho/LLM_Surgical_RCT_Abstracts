Eligibility criteria included adults with primary symptomatic varicose veins (CEAP grade C2 or above) and specific vein involvement. Participants were randomised using a minimization algorithm to UGFS, EVLA, or surgery. The primary outcome was behavioural recovery, assessed using the 15-item BRAVVO questionnaire at 6 weeks post-treatment. Randomisation was concealed, but blinding was not applied.\n\nResults: A total of 798 participants were randomised: 265 to UGFS, 267 to EVLA, and 266 to surgery. Of these, 655 completed the BRAVVO questionnaire. Both UGFS and EVLA resulted in significantly quicker recovery than surgery for 13 of 15 behaviours. UGFS was superior to EVLA for full-time work (HR 1.43, 95% CI 1.11 to 1.85), childcare (HR 1.45, 95% CI 1.04 to 2.02), and walking (short: HR 1.48, 95% CI 1.19 to 1.84; long: HR 1.32, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.66). No adverse events were reported.\n\nInterpretation: Both UGFS and EVLA facilitated more rapid recovery than surgery, with UGFS showing superiority over EVLA for certain behaviours. The BRAVVO questionnaire provides valuable insights into patient recovery expectations post-treatment.\n\nTrial registration: ISRCTN51995477.\n\nFunding: The trial was funded by the National Institute for Health Research.",
