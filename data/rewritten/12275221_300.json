A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Early Postoperative Oral Hydration in Paediatric Surgery: A Randomised Controlled Trial\n\nBackground: This randomised controlled trial assessed the impact of early postoperative oral hydration on patient satisfaction and safety in paediatric patients undergoing elective surgery.\n\nMethods: The trial was conducted at a tertiary care centre, enrolling children aged 1–5 years, of ASA physical status I–II, undergoing elective surgery under general anaesthesia. Participants were randomly allocated to receive either early hydration (EH) within 30 minutes of arrival to the post-anaesthesia care unit (PACU) or delayed standard hydration (SH) after 2 hours. The primary outcome was the FLACC score at 1 hour in PACU. Randomisation was performed using sealed, opaque envelopes, and the outcome assessor was blinded. A total of 66 children were randomised between June 2023 and July 2023, with 33 in each group. The analysis included 61 children, using a per-protocol approach.\n\nResults: The median FLACC score after 1 hour in PACU was significantly lower in Group EH [1 (0.25–2)] compared to Group SH [2 (1–3)], with a p-value of 0.028. Parental satisfaction was higher in Group EH, with a median Likert score of 5 (4-5) compared to 4 (4-4) in Group SH. No major complications, such as vomiting or hypoxia, were reported in either group.\n\nInterpretation: Early postoperative oral hydration is both efficacious and safe, resulting in lower FLACC scores and higher parental satisfaction compared to delayed hydration. The trial was registered at the Clinical Trials Registry-India (CTRI/2022/06/043291). No conflicts of interest were reported, and the study was funded by institutional resources. These findings support the implementation of early oral hydration protocols in paediatric surgical settings to enhance patient and parental satisfaction without increasing adverse events.",
