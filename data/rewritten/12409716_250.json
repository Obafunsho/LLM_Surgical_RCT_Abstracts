A 250-word version\n\nTitle: NEON Study: A Randomised Controlled Trial\n\nBackground: Digital nerve injuries are common, and the effectiveness of microsurgical suture repair versus nerve alignment alone is uncertain. This study aimed to evaluate the superiority of suture repair over alignment alone.\n\nMethods: This multicentre, double-blind, randomised controlled trial was conducted across 17 NHS hospitals in the UK. Participants aged 18 and over with unilateral digital nerve injuries were randomised 1:1 to either microsurgical suture repair or nerve alignment alone. The primary outcome was the Impact of Hand Nerve Disorders (I-HaND v2) patient-reported outcome measure at 12 months. Randomisation was computer-generated with allocation concealment, and both participants and assessors were blinded.\n\nResults: Between September 2020 and November 2022, 122 participants were randomised, 61 to each group. Primary outcome data were available for 106 participants (87%). No significant differences were found in I-HaND scores at 12 months (mean difference = 4.3, 95% CI [-0.9, 10.8], p = 0.09). Secondary outcomes, including Patient Evaluation Measure and EQ-5D-5L scores, showed no differences. Complications were similar between groups. The trial was closed early due to slow recruitment.\n\nInterpretation: The NEON trial found no evidence supporting the superiority of suture repair over nerve alignment alone for isolated digital nerve injuries. These findings can guide future research and clinical practice.\n\nTrial registration: ISRCTN16211574\n\nFunding: NIHR Health Technology Assessment (NIHR127807–18/37).",
