This study investigates whether remote ischemic preconditioning (RIPC) reduces neurocognitive dysfunction in patients undergoing CPB surgery.\n\nMethods: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) involving adult patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) with RIPC. The primary outcome was the incidence of POCD, measured up to 12 months postoperatively. Randomisation and allocation concealment were adequately reported in all included studies. Blinding was maintained for participants and personnel. Five RCTs with 1,843 participants were included. Meta-analysis was performed using a fixed-effect model due to low heterogeneity.\n\nResults: RIPC did not significantly reduce the incidence of POCD (OR = 0.79, 95% CI = 0.56–1.11) or improve cognitive function (OR = 0.80, 95% CI = 0.50–1.27). Specific cognitive tests showed no significant improvement with RIPC. No adverse events were reported. The analysis was intention-to-treat.\n\nInterpretation: RIPC did not demonstrate a significant effect on cognitive performance in CABG patients. The evidence does not support RIPC as a neuroprotective intervention in this context. Further high-quality RCTs are needed.\n\nTrial registration: PROSPERO CRD42023430880.\n\nFunding: No financial support was provided.",
