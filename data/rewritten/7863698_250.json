This study evaluates the effects of an iteratively adapted MBI, ESRT, on perceived stress, executive cognitive function, psychosocial well-being, and pro-inflammatory gene expression in surgical and mixed specialty PGY-1 trainees.\n\nMethods: Two single-institution randomised clinical trials were conducted. Participants were first-year surgical (ESRT-1, n = 44) and mixed specialty (ESRT-2, n = 45) residents. ESRT-1 involved 8 weekly 2-hour classes, while ESRT-2 involved 6 weekly 90-minute classes. The primary outcome was perceived stress, and the secondary outcome was executive function. Other outcomes included burnout, mindfulness, and pro-inflammatory gene expression. Randomisation was performed using a computer-generated sequence, with allocation concealment ensured. Outcome assessors were blinded.\n\nResults: ESRT did not significantly affect perceived stress. ESRT-1 participants showed improved executive function and mindfulness scores, while ESRT-2 participants had lower emotional exhaustion and depersonalization scores at follow-up. Pooled analysis indicated reduced pro-inflammatory RNA expression in ESRT-treated participants compared to controls.\n\nInterpretation: ESRT may variably benefit executive function, burnout, and physiological distress in PGY-1 trainees. Further tailoring could optimize effects.\n\nTrial registration: [Trial registration number]\n\nFunding: [Source of funding]",
