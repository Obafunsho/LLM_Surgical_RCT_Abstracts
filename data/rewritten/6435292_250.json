A 250-word version\n\nTitle: High-Sensitivity Cardiac Troponin T in Detecting Perioperative Myocardial Infarction: A Randomised Controlled Trial\n\nBackground: The study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of a high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T (hscTnT) assay compared to contemporary cardiac troponin I (cTnI) in detecting perioperative myocardial infarction (MI) after non-cardiac surgery.\n\nMethods: This ancillary study of the Vitamins in Nitrous Oxide trial was conducted in a surgical setting. Participants included 605 patients with baseline and at least one postoperative hscTnT value. The primary outcome was the incidence of myocardial injury and MI, assessed using various hscTnT change metrics. Randomisation and allocation concealment methods were not specified. Blinding details were not provided.\n\nResults: Among 605 patients, 70 (12%) had ECG changes consistent with myocardial ischemia. Using contemporary cTnI, 82 patients (14%) were diagnosed with myocardial injury, with 31 (5.1%) having an adjudicated MI. The hscTnT assay identified 67 patients (11%) with MI, doubling the detection rate. Incidence rates of myocardial injury varied from 12% to 65% based on hscTnT metrics. New postoperative hscTnT elevation was linked to a 5-fold increase in 6-month mortality. Adverse events were not reported.\n\nInterpretation: The hscTnT assay significantly increases the detection of perioperative MI compared to cTnI. However, varying hscTnT metrics may lead to diagnostic discrepancies. Trial registration and funding details were not provided.",
