The study aimed to evaluate hospital surgical volume's effect on overall survival and gastric cancer recurrence, using Medicare claims data. The primary outcome was overall survival, assessed over a median follow-up of 8.9 years. Randomisation and allocation concealment methods were not specified. Blinding details were not provided.\n\nResults: Hospital surgical volume was not predictive of overall survival (P = 0.46) or disease-free survival (P = 0.43). Patients who underwent D1 or D2 dissection at high- or moderate-volume centers had an adjusted hazard ratio of 0.80 (95% CI, 0.53–1.20) for overall survival and 0.78 (95% CI, 0.53–1.14) for disease-free survival compared to low-volume hospitals, though these results were not statistically significant. No survival impact was observed for D0 resections. Adverse events were not reported.\n\nInterpretation: Excluding perioperative mortality, hospital procedure volume had no overall effect on long-term gastric cancer survival. The potential benefit of moderate- to high-volume centers for patients undergoing D1 or D2 dissection requires confirmation in larger studies. Trial registration and funding details were not provided. Further research is needed to explore the relationship between hospital volume and surgical outcomes in gastric cancer.",
