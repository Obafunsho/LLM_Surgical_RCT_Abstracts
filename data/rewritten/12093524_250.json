This study investigates their combined effect on myocardial protection.\n\nMethods: In a randomised controlled trial, 24 male New Zealand White rabbits were allocated to four groups: control, rIPC, APC, and rIPC+APC. The rIPC group underwent four cycles of 5-minute hind limb ischemia and reperfusion. The APC group received 2.5 vol% sevoflurane for 20 minutes, followed by a 20-minute washout. The primary outcome was myocardial infarction size after 30 minutes of global ischemia and 2 hours of reperfusion, assessed using TTC staining. Randomisation was computer-generated, and allocation was concealed. Outcome assessors were blinded.\n\nResults: Both rIPC and APC significantly reduced myocardial infarction size by over 50% compared to controls (rIPC: 12.1±1.7%; APC: 13.5±2.1%; control: 31.3±3.0%; P<0.01). The combination of rIPC and APC did not provide additional protection (rIPC+APC: 14.4±3.3%). No adverse events were reported.\n\nInterpretation: rIPC and APC independently reduce myocardial infarction size, but their combination does not enhance protection. Further studies should explore dose-response effects and potential interactions.\n\nTrial registration: Not provided.\n\nFunding: Not specified.",
