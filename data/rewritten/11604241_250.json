A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Electroacupuncture for Nonspecific Low Back Pain\n\nBackground: Nonspecific low back pain is prevalent, and electroacupuncture is a potential treatment. This study evaluates its efficacy compared to standard therapy and manual needling therapy.\n\nMethods: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials. Participants with nonspecific low back pain were included. The intervention was electroacupuncture, compared to standard therapy or manual needling therapies. The primary outcome was pain intensity, measured using the Visual Analog Scale and Numerical Rating Scale at treatment completion and follow-up. Randomisation and allocation concealment methods were not specified. Blinding was not feasible due to the nature of the intervention. Ten studies with 660 participants were included, with analysis conducted using a random-effects model.\n\nResults: Electroacupuncture with standard therapy showed a significant reduction in pain compared to standard therapy alone (SMD -0.83, 95% CI -1.22 to -0.43, P < 0.0001). At one month, the effect was large (SMD -0.84, 95% CI -1.30 to -0.37, P = 0.0004), and at two months, it was small (SMD -0.40, 95% CI -0.65 to -0.16, P = 0.001). No significant difference was found compared to manual needling therapies (SMD 0, 95% CI -0.71 to 0.71, P = 1.0). Adverse events were not reported.\n\nInterpretation: Electroacupuncture combined with standard therapy provides greater pain reduction for nonspecific low back pain than standard therapy alone, with sustained effects up to two months. The certainty of evidence is very low, indicating a need for more robust studies.\n\nTrial registration: PROSPERO CRD42024541800.\n\nFunding: Not specified.",
