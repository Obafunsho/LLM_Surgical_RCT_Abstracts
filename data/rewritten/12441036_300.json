A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Doppler Microvascular Ultrasound in Skull Base Surgery\n\nBackground: This study evaluates the effectiveness of Doppler microvascular ultrasound (MVD) in enhancing intraoperative assessment and protection of arterial blood flow during skull base surgery.\n\nMethods: A retrospective analysis was conducted on 56 patients who underwent skull base tumor resection with MVD assistance at the Department of Neurosurgery, First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University from September 2017 to June 2024. The study focused on complex skull base tumors, including those in the sellar region, sphenoid ridge, and cavernous sinus. MVD was employed to monitor blood flow in vessels adjacent to the tumors. The spatial relationship and patency of vessels and tumors were evaluated using preoperative multimodal imaging.\n\nResults: No intraoperative vascular injuries were observed, as confirmed by intraoperative Doppler monitoring and postoperative imaging. All patients experienced favorable postoperative outcomes, with no new neurological deficits reported. MVD facilitated precise intraoperative localization and evaluation of blood vessels, quantitatively supported by significant increases in contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) after Doppler application. In two representative cases, the addition of FLOW800 fluorescence imaging provided further CNR improvement, suggesting enhanced visualization and vascular protection.\n\nInterpretation: MVD offers real-time intraoperative information on arterial blood flow during skull base surgeries, enabling surgeons to identify and preserve critical vessels, thereby improving surgical safety, resection accuracy, and patient outcomes. The integration of MVD and fluorescence imaging is anticipated to play an increasingly vital role in complex skull base procedures, enhancing both structural and perfusion-based imaging capabilities.\n\nTrial registration: Not applicable.\n\nFunding: Not specified.",
