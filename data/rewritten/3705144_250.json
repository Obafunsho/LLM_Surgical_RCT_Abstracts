A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of [99m Tc]Tilmanocept for Sentinel Lymph Node Mapping in Breast Cancer\n\nBackground: Sentinel lymph node (SLN) surgery is crucial for staging breast cancer. This study evaluates [99m Tc]tilmanocept, a receptor-targeted radiopharmaceutical, in SLN mapping.\n\nMethods: Conducted at 13 centers, 148 breast cancer patients without presurgical lymph node metastases were enrolled. Each received [99m Tc]tilmanocept and vital blue dye (VBD). The primary outcome was the concordance of SLN detection between [99m Tc]tilmanocept and VBD, measured intraoperatively.\n\nResults: Of 148 patients, 207 of 209 nodes detected by VBD were also detected by [99m Tc]tilmanocept, achieving a concordance rate of 99.04% (p < 0.0001). [99m Tc]tilmanocept identified 320 nodes, with 207 (64.7%) also detected by VBD. It detected at least one SLN in more patients (146) than VBD (131, p < 0.0001). Among 33 pathology-positive nodes, [99m Tc]tilmanocept detected 31, while VBD detected 25 (p = 0.0312). No serious adverse events were attributed to [99m Tc]tilmanocept.\n\nInterpretation: [99m Tc]Tilmanocept successfully met the primary endpoint, demonstrating superior SLN detection compared to VBD. It identified more SLNs and metastatic nodes, suggesting enhanced clinical utility.\n\nTrial registration: NCT00671918 and NCT01106040.\n\nFunding: Sponsored by Navidea Biopharmaceuticals.",
