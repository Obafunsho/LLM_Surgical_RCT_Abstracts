A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial on the Management of Left Ventricular Pseudoaneurysm\n\nBackground: Left ventricular pseudoaneurysm (LVP) is a rare, life-threatening condition resulting from myocardial rupture. It is often caused by myocardial infarction, cardiac surgery, trauma, or infections. Accurate diagnosis and management are crucial to prevent complications.\n\nMethods: This randomised controlled trial was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of advanced multimodality imaging in diagnosing and managing LVP. Participants were recruited from a tertiary care hospital. Eligibility criteria included patients with suspected or diagnosed LVP. The intervention group underwent cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) and cardiac computed tomography (CCT) in addition to echocardiography, while the control group received standard echocardiography alone. Randomisation was computer-generated, and allocation was concealed using sealed envelopes. Blinding was applied to outcome assessors.\n\nResults: A total of 200 participants were randomised: 100 to the intervention group and 100 to the control group. The primary outcome was the accuracy of LVP diagnosis, measured over a 6-month period. The intervention group showed a significant improvement in diagnostic accuracy (mean difference = 15%, 95% CI 10% to 20%; p < 0.001). Adverse events were reported in 3% of the intervention group and 1% of the control group, with mild gastrointestinal side-effects.\n\nInterpretation: The use of CMR and CCT significantly enhances the diagnostic accuracy of LVP compared to echocardiography alone. This approach may improve patient outcomes by facilitating timely and appropriate management. Trial registration: NCT12345678. Funding: This study was funded by the National Institutes of Health.",
