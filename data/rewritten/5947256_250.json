A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial Comparing Intracutaneous and Transcutaneous Suturing of Ileostomies\n\nBackground: Ileostomy construction is common but associated with morbidity. This study compared intracutaneous versus transcutaneous suturing of ileostomies on faecal leakage and quality of life.\n\nMethods: This multicentre, parallel-group randomised controlled trial was conducted in 11 hospitals in the Netherlands. Patients aged 18-80 years scheduled for ileostomy were randomised 1:1 to intracutaneous (IC) or transcutaneous (TC) suturing. The primary outcome was faecal leakage within 3 months. Secondary outcomes included stoma-related quality of life and costs. Randomisation was computerised, with allocation concealed in sealed envelopes. Blinding was not applied.\n\nResults: Between April 2011 and February 2016, 339 patients were randomised: 170 to IC and 169 to TC. Leakage rates were higher in the IC group (52.4%) compared to the TC group (41.4%), with a risk difference of 11.0% (95% CI 0.3 to 21.2). Skin irritation rates were high in both groups (78.2% IC vs 72.2% TC), with no significant difference (risk difference 6.1%, 95% CI -3.2 to 15.1). No significant differences were found in quality of life or costs. Analysis was intention-to-treat.\n\nInterpretation: Intracutaneous suturing is associated with more peristomal leakage than transcutaneous suturing. Overall stoma-related complications did not differ between techniques. Trial registration: NTR2369.\n\nFunding: Not specified.",
