This study aimed to estimate atrial conduction using AVCP and assess its impact on pAVD.\n\nMethods: This single-center, randomized controlled trial was conducted at a university-affiliated tertiary care hospital. Cardiac surgical patients at risk of left ventricular failure post-cardiopulmonary bypass were included. Temporary BiVP was optimized immediately after bypass, with constant vasoactive medication and fluid infusion rates. Randomization and allocation concealment methods were not specified. Blinding details were not provided.\n\nParticipants: Seven patients were randomized, with three in the short-AVCP group (<64 ms) and four in the long-AVCP group (>64 ms).\n\nIntervention: Temporary BiVP optimization was the intervention, with no specific comparator.\n\nOutcome: The primary outcomes were optimum cardiac output (OptCO) and mean arterial pressure (OptMAP), measured immediately post-bypass.\n\nResults: The short-AVCP group had AVCP, OptCO, and OptMAP of 40 ± 11, 120 ± 0, and 150 ± 30 ms, respectively. The long-AVCP group had 89 ± 10, 218 ± 44, and 218 ± 29 ms. OptCO and OptMAP were significantly lower in the short-AVCP group (p = 0.015 and p = 0.029).\n\nInterpretation: AVCP varies widely post-bypass, influencing pAVD. Inappropriately short pAVDs may result if AVCP is not corrected, potentially rendering BiVP ineffective.\n\nTrial registration: Not provided.\n\nFunding: Not specified.",
