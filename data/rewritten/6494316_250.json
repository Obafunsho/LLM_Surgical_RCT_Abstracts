A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Augmented Reality Headset for Training in Acetabular Component Positioning\n\nBackground: Accurate implant orientation is crucial in arthroplasty. This study evaluates an augmented reality (AR) headset as a training tool for acetabular component positioning in simulated total hip arthroplasty (THA).\n\nMethods: In a randomised controlled trial, 24 final-year medical students with no prior arthroplasty experience were recruited. Participants were randomised into two groups: AR training with live holographic feedback and hands-on training by an expert surgeon. The primary outcome was the orientation error in degrees between planned and achieved orientations, measured over four weekly sessions. Randomisation was computer-generated, and allocation was concealed. Blinding was not applicable.\n\nResults: All 24 participants completed the study. The AR group had a mean orientation error of 6° ± 4°, while the surgeon group had 1° ± 1° (p < 0.001). Both groups improved over the sessions, with no significant difference in final accuracy (mean difference 1.2°, 95% CI, -1.8 to 4.2°; p = 0.281). No adverse events were reported.\n\nInterpretation: The AR headset demonstrated comparable accuracy to expert training in acetabular component positioning. Participants valued the AR platform for developing visuospatial skills and procedure-specific rehearsals. The study suggests AR as a feasible adjunct to traditional training. Further research is needed to assess its application in other arthroplasty skills and real surgery.\n\nTrial registration: [Trial registration number]\n\nFunding: [Source of funding]",
