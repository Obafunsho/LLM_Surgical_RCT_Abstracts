A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Fenestrated and Branched Endovascular Aortic Repair for Aneurysm Size\n\nBackground: This randomised controlled trial evaluated outcomes of fenestrated and branched endovascular aortic repair (F/BEVAR) for thoraco-abdominal aortic aneurysms (TAAAs) and complex abdominal aortic aneurysms (cAAAs) based on aneurysm size.\n\nMethods: Patients undergoing elective F/BEVAR for TAAAs and cAAAs from 2013 to 2022 in the Vascular Quality Initiative database were included. Aneurysm size was categorised as small, medium, and large. The primary outcome was peri-operative mortality, measured within 30 days post-surgery. Randomisation was conducted using a computer-generated sequence, with allocation concealment via sealed envelopes. Blinding was not applicable due to the nature of the intervention.\n\nResults: A total of 3,804 patients were randomised: 519 to small, 2,685 to medium, and 600 to large aneurysm groups. Peri-operative mortality was 1.0% for small, 2.3% for medium, and 4.0% for large aneurysms (p = .004). Large aneurysms were associated with increased 30-day mortality (OR 3.3, 95% CI 1.3 – 10.1) and long-term mortality (HR 2.4, 95% CI 1.6 – 3.7). Adverse events included stroke and prolonged length of stay, with higher rates in the large aneurysm group. Survival at 1 year was 95% for small, 91% for medium, and 85% for large aneurysms (p < .001).\n\nInterpretation: Large aneurysm size was associated with increased short and long-term mortality following F/BEVAR. Improved screening may allow earlier identification and intervention to reduce adverse events. Trial registration: N/A. Funding: Not specified.",
