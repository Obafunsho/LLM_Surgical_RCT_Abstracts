A 300-word version\n\nTitle: A Randomised Controlled Trial Comparing Programmed Intermittent Epidural Boluses and Continuous Epidural Infusion for Postoperative Analgesia after Elective Cesarean Section\n\nBackground: This study aimed to compare the analgesic effects of programmed intermittent epidural boluses (PIEB) and continuous epidural infusion (CEI) for postoperative analgesia after elective cesarean section (CS).\n\nMethods: In this single-center, prospective, two-arm randomised controlled trial, 74 women scheduled for elective CS at Samsung Medical Center, Korea, were randomised to receive either PIEB or CEI between October 2022 and April 2023. The PIEB group received 4 ml-intermittent boluses of 0.11% ropivacaine every hour at a rate of 120 ml/h, while the CEI group received a constant rate of 4 ml/h of 0.11% ropivacaine. The primary outcome was the pain score at rest at 36 h after CS. Randomisation was performed using a web service with allocation concealment by sealed envelopes. Participants, clinicians, and outcome assessors were blinded. Sample size was calculated to detect a clinically meaningful difference in pain scores with 90% power.\n\nResults: The pain score at rest at 36 h after CS was significantly lower in the PIEB group compared with the CEI group (median difference: 2, 95% CI [1, 2], P < 0.001). The mean time-weighted pain scores at rest and during mobilization were also significantly lower in the PIEB group (pain at rest; mean difference [MD]: 37.5, 95% CI [24.6, 50.4], P < 0.001/pain during mobilization; MD: 56.6, 95% CI [39.8, 73.5], P < 0.001). The incidence of motor blockade was significantly reduced in the PIEB group (P < 0.001). No significant adverse events were reported.\n\nInterpretation: PIEB provides superior analgesia with less motor blockade than CEI in postpartum women after CS. Trial registration: KCT0007756.
