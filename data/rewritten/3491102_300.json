The vasoactive-inotropic score (VIS) is used to quantify this support in pediatric patients and may be beneficial for adults. This study investigates VIS in adults post-cardiac surgery.\n\nMethods: This randomised controlled trial included 50 adult patients at high risk of left ventricular dysfunction following cardiac surgery. Participants were randomised to receive either temporary biventricular pacing or standard care (no pacing) after cardiopulmonary bypass. The study was conducted from April 2007 to June 2011. VIS was assessed after cardiopulmonary bypass, after sternal closure, and 0–7 hours after ICU admission. Randomisation was computer-generated, and allocation was concealed. Blinding details were not provided.\n\nResults: In the biventricular pacing group, VIS decreased from 12.0±1.5 to 10.5±2.0, whereas in the standard care group, it increased from 12.5±1.9 to 15.5±2.9 over the initial three collection points (mean duration 131 minutes). The difference in VIS slopes was statistically significant (p=0.02) and remained significant for the first hour in the ICU but not beyond (p=0.26). No adverse events were reported in either group.\n\nInterpretation: Temporary biventricular pacing is associated with a reduction in VIS during the early postoperative period. Further studies are warranted to assess its effects on arrhythmogenesis, morbidity, mortality, and hospital costs.\n\nTrial registration: Not provided.\n\nFunding: Not specified.",
