  "abstract": "1. A 250-word version\n\nBackground: This study aimed to assess the efficacy of acetaminophen and topical diclofenac (AtopD) combination therapy compared to monotherapies in osteoarthritis (OA) pain, leveraging evidence from acute pain settings using a model-based meta-analysis (MBMA).\n\nMethods: A literature search identified randomized controlled trials (RCTs) from the MEDLINE database studying the AtopD combination for acute pain. An MBMA was conducted to evaluate pain score reduction and opioid-sparing effect (OSE). The analysis focused on 5 RCTs with 353 patients, assessing the interaction coefficient for OSE.\n\nResults: The AtopD combination demonstrated greater pain score reduction compared to acetaminophen monotherapy. However, pain score reduction was more susceptible to confounding by opioid patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) than OSE. The MBMA revealed a statistically significant interaction coefficient, indicating a 32% reduction in opioid use with the combination versus acetaminophen monotherapy. Differences in effect size were less conclusive versus diclofenac monotherapy.\n\nInterpretation: The AtopD combination showed greater pain reduction and opioid-sparing efficacy compared to acetaminophen monotherapy. Given the similar pain pathways and mechanisms of action in acute and mild-to-moderate OA pain, comparable beneficial effects may be anticipated in chronic OA pain. Prospective RCTs and real-world studies are needed to confirm these findings.",
