A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial Comparing Pain in Self-Reduction vs. Physician-Guided Reduction of Anterior Shoulder Dislocations\n\nBackground: This study aimed to compare the pain experienced during self-reduction using the Boss-Holzach-Matter (BHM) technique versus physician-guided reduction using the Spaso technique for acute anterior shoulder dislocations.\n\nMethods: Conducted at a tertiary referral center's emergency department, this single-center, observer-blinded trial included patients aged 18-60 with acute anterior shoulder dislocations. Participants were randomly allocated to either the Sp group (n=30) or the BHM group (n=30) using block randomization with sealed opaque envelopes. The primary outcome was pain during reduction, measured on a 0-10 visual analogue scale (VAS) immediately post-reduction. The study was powered to detect a 2-point VAS difference with 80% power and α=0.05. Randomization and allocation concealment were ensured by an independent analyst. Outcome assessors were blinded.\n\nResults: From May 2015 to February 2017, 60 patients were randomized. The BHM group reported significantly less pain (mean VAS 3.57, SD 2.1) compared to the Sp group (mean VAS 5.26, SD 2.9; p=0.047). No significant differences were found in reduction time (Sp: 105 seconds, BHM: 90 seconds; p=0.6) or success rate (Sp: 67%, BHM: 77%; p=0.39). No complications were reported in either group.\n\nInterpretation: The BHM self-reduction technique resulted in less pain and was as effective as the Spaso technique, supporting its use as a first-line treatment for anterior shoulder dislocations. The trial was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02527603) and received institutional review board approval (CSPTCOT201501). No funding source was reported. The study's findings favor the BHM technique for its simplicity and effectiveness, particularly in emergency settings and for patients with recurrent dislocations.",
