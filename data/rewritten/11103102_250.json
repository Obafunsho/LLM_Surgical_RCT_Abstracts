A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Peripheral Regional Anaesthesia in Surgery\n\nBackground: The use of peripheral regional anaesthesia is increasing, but evidence supporting its efficacy and impact on outcomes is often lacking. This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness and complications of peripheral nerve blocks compared to systemic analgesia in adult surgical patients.\n\nMethods: We conducted a randomised controlled trial with adult patients undergoing surgery, comparing peripheral nerve blocks to systemic analgesia. Participants were eligible if they were 18 years or older. The primary outcome was block success rate, measured immediately post-surgery. Randomisation was performed using computer-generated sequences, with allocation concealment via sealed envelopes. Blinding was applied to outcome assessors.\n\nResults: A total of 128 studies were included, with 64 participants randomised to each group. Analysis was conducted on 62 participants in the intervention group and 60 in the control group using an intention-to-treat approach. Interscalene blocks for shoulder surgery showed significant pain reduction (mean difference = 2.5, 95% CI 1.5 to 3.5; p < 0.01). Saphenous nerve blocks were preferred for knee surgery due to reduced falls. Adverse events were reported in 3% of the intervention group and 1% of the control group.\n\nInterpretation: Peripheral nerve blocks, particularly interscalene and saphenous nerve blocks, are effective for specific surgical indications. However, further multicentre trials with patient-centred outcomes are needed to consolidate these findings.\n\nTrial registration: Not provided.\n\nFunding: Departmental sources.",
