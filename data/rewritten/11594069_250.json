This study evaluates the effect of abaloparatide on BMD in proximal femoral regions.\n\nMethods: This Phase-3, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial included 500 postmenopausal women with osteoporosis from the ACTIVE trial. Participants were randomly assigned to receive abaloparatide (n=250) or placebo (n=250) for 18 months. Randomisation was stratified by study site and race/ethnicity. Blinding included patients, clinicians, and outcome assessors. The primary outcome was the change in integral volumetric BMD in Gruen zones over 18 months. Analysis was intention-to-treat.\n\nResults: At 6 and 18 months, the abaloparatide group showed greater increases in integral volumetric BMD in all zones compared to placebo (p<0.005). Cortical surface BMD increased in zones 1, 6, and 7 at month 6 (p<0.005) and in all zones at month 18 (p<0.0001). No serious adverse events were reported.\n\nInterpretation: Abaloparatide significantly increases BMD in proximal femoral regions, suggesting potential value for preoperative bone health optimization in THA candidates.\n\nTrial registration: NCT01343004\n\nFunding: Not specified.",
