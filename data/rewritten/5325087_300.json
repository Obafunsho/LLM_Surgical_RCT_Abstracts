A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Damage Control Laparotomy Versus Definitive Surgical Management in Trauma Patients\n\nBackground: This randomised controlled trial aimed to assess the effects of damage control laparotomy (DCL) compared to definitive surgical management (DSM) on mortality and complications in trauma patients.\n\nMethods: Trauma patients at 12 level 1 North American trauma centers were randomised based on transfusion ratios as described in the PROPPR trial. The primary outcomes were 24-hour and 30-day mortality. A mixed-effects logistic model was used to compare DCL and DSM, with a random effect for study site. The trial included 329 patients undergoing emergent laparotomy: 213 DCL and 116 DSM. Randomisation and allocation concealment methods were not specified. Blinding details were not provided.\n\nResults: DCL rates varied between institutions (33%-83%, p=0.002). Median Injury Severity Score (ISS) was higher in the DCL group, 29 versus 21 (p<0.001). 24-hour mortality was 19% with DCL versus 4% (p<0.001); 30-day mortality was 28% with DCL versus 19% (p<0.001). In a mixed-effects model, ISS and major intra-abdominal vascular injury (MVI) were correlates of DCL. DCL was not associated with 30-day mortality (OR 2.33, CI 0.97-5.60). Sepsis and ventilator-associated pneumonia occurred more frequently with DCL (p<0.05). 80% of DCL patients met standard criteria.\n\nInterpretation: Although DCL utilization varied significantly between institutions, there was no significant mortality difference between centers. This suggests that tempering DCL use may not decrease mortality but could reduce related complications.\n\nTrial registration: [Trial registration number]\n\nFunding: [Source of funding]",
