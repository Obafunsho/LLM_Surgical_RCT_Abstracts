A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Single-Cell Spatial Transcriptome Analysis in a Randomised Controlled Trial of Anti-PD-L1 Therapy Combined with Chemoradiotherapy for NSCLC\n\nBackground: This randomised controlled trial evaluates the impact of anti-PD-L1 therapy combined with chemoradiotherapy (CRT) on the tumour microenvironment in unresectable non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).\n\nMethods: Conducted at the National Comprehensive Cancer Study Board (NCCHE), the trial included eight patients at UICC 8th Stage IIIA. Participants were randomised to receive either preoperative CRT or preoperative ICI-CRT. Xenium, a single-cell spatial analysis tool, was employed to assess immune dynamics and residual cancer cells post-treatment. The primary outcome was the alteration in immune environment, measured at the single-cell level. Randomisation was achieved through predefined protocols, and allocation concealment was maintained. Blinding was not specified.\n\nResults: Posttreatment, there was a significant increase in CXCL9+ cells and CXCL13+ T cells around tumour cells. CXCL13+ T cells directly impacted cancer cells, while clusters of immune-cold cancer cells activated DNA repair pathways and exhibited high proliferative capacity. The study identified distinct immune environment characteristics post-anti-PD-L1-CRT. No adverse events were reported.\n\nInterpretation: The findings suggest potential advancements in developing treatments to enhance posttreatment immune responses and address resistance challenges. The trial was registered under Protocol Number 2022-407.\n\nFunding: The study was funded by the National Comprehensive Cancer Study Board.",
