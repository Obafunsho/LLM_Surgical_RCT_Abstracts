Patients were divided into two groups: those receiving NSAIDs (NSAIDs group) and those not receiving NSAIDs (control group). Propensity score matching (PSM) was used to minimize confounding bias. The primary outcome was the incidence of PPCs within 7 days post-surgery.\n\nResults: A total of 306 patients were included, with 139 in the NSAIDs group and 167 in the control group. After PSM, 119 patients were in each group. The NSAIDs group showed significantly lower frequencies of postoperative pneumonia (5.9% vs. 13.4%, P=0.048) and respiratory failure (0.8% vs. 5.9%, P=0.03) compared to the control group. The NSAIDs group also had reduced intraoperative fentanyl equivalents, lower ICU admission rates (2.5% vs. 10.1%, P=0.02), and shorter postoperative hospital stays (median 5.0 days vs. 6.0 days, P=0.03).\n\nInterpretation: Intraoperative NSAIDs were associated with a reduction in specific PPCs, ICU admissions, and hospital stay duration in NSCLC patients. These findings suggest potential benefits of NSAIDs in surgical recovery.\n\nTrial registration: Not applicable.\n\nFunding: Not specified.",
