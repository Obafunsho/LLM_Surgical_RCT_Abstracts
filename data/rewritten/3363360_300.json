This study aimed to assess the effectiveness of mesh reinforcement in reducing the incidence of clinically significant pancreatic leaks.\n\nMethods: Conducted at a large tertiary hospital, this single-blinded, parallel-group, randomised controlled trial included patients eligible for left pancreatectomy. Participants were randomised intraoperatively to receive either mesh reinforcement (Seamguard® or Peristrips Dry®) or no mesh reinforcement. The primary outcome was the incidence of clinically significant pancreatic leaks, defined by the ISGPF grading system, over a 6-week period. Randomisation was achieved using a computer-generated sequence with allocation concealment. Patients were blinded to their group allocation.\n\nResults: A total of 100 patients were randomised: 54 to the mesh group and 46 to the control group. One death occurred in each group. ISGPF grade B and C leaks were observed in 1.9% (1/53) of patients in the mesh group compared to 20% (11/45) in the control group (p=0.0007). The analysis was conducted on an intention-to-treat basis. No significant adverse events were reported in either group.\n\nInterpretation: Mesh reinforcement of the pancreatic transection line significantly reduces the incidence of clinically significant pancreatic fistula in patients undergoing left pancreatectomy. These findings support the use of mesh reinforcement as a standard practice in left pancreatectomy to minimize postoperative complications. The trial is registered at Clinicaltrials.gov (NCT01359410).\n\nFunding: Not specified.",
