A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial on the Effect of Intravenous Lignocaine Infusion on Intraoperative Desflurane Requirements\n\nBackground: This randomised controlled trial investigated the impact of intravenous (IV) lignocaine infusion on intraoperative end-tidal desflurane (Et-Des) concentration required to maintain Bispectral Index Scale (BIS) values between 40 and 60 during laparoscopic surgery.\n\nMethods: Forty-eight patients aged 18-75 years, scheduled for laparoscopic cholecystectomy, appendicectomy, or ovarian cystectomy at Hospital Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia, were randomised 1:1 to receive either a bolus of 1.5 mg/kg of 2% lignocaine hydrochloride followed by an infusion of 1 mg/kg/h (Group A) or an equal volume of normal saline (Group B). Randomisation was computer-generated with allocation concealment using sealed envelopes. Both patients and clinicians were blinded. The primary outcome was the Et-Des concentration, measured every 10 minutes until skin closure.\n\nResults: Forty-seven patients were analysed (23 in Group A, 24 in Group B). Group A had a significantly lower Et-Des concentration (4.3% ± 0.45%) compared to Group B (5.3% ± 0.56%, p < 0.001). The cost of desflurane was also significantly reduced in Group A. No significant differences in heart rate or mean arterial pressure were observed. One adverse event of fast atrial fibrillation occurred in Group A.\n\nInterpretation: IV lignocaine infusion significantly reduces Et-Des concentration and cost without affecting hemodynamic stability in laparoscopic surgery.
