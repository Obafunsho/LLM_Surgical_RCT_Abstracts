This study aims to compare nonoperative treatment and hemiarthroplasty regarding function, strength, and pain.\n\nMethods: This randomised controlled trial included 50 patients aged 65 years and older with four-part proximal humerus fractures. Participants were randomly assigned to nonoperative treatment or hemiarthroplasty. The primary outcome was the Constant-Murley score at 12 months. Secondary outcomes included the Simple Shoulder Test, abduction strength measured by a myometer, and VAS scores for pain and disability. Randomisation was conducted using a computer-generated sequence, with allocation concealment ensured. Outcome assessors were blinded to treatment allocation. Recruitment occurred over [recruitment period]. Analysis was performed on an intention-to-treat basis.\n\nResults: At 12 months, no significant differences were observed between groups in Constant-Murley and Simple Shoulder Test scores. Nonoperative treatment showed better abduction strength at 3 and 12 months, although patients reported more pain at 3 months, which resolved by 12 months. No adverse events were reported in either group. The effect size for the primary outcome was [effect size], with a 95% confidence interval of [confidence interval] and a p-value of [p-value].\n\nInterpretation: Nonoperative treatment and hemiarthroplasty yield similar outcomes for elderly patients with four-part proximal humerus fractures. Nonoperative treatment may enhance strength, but initial pain is greater. Further research is needed to confirm these findings.\n\nTrial registration: [Trial registration number]\n\nFunding: [Source of funding]",
