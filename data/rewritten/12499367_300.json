A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Esketamine for PONV Prophylaxis in Gynecological Laparoscopy\n\nBackground: Postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) affect 40–80% of patients undergoing gynecological laparoscopy (GLS). This study evaluates esketamine, an NMDA receptor antagonist, for PONV prophylaxis compared to sufentanil.\n\nMethods: In this single-center, double-blind trial, 150 patients aged 18–60 years, ASA I–II, undergoing elective GLS at the Third Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-Sen University were randomized to receive esketamine (0.25mg/kg, n=75) or sufentanil (0.1μg/kg, n=75) at incision closure. The primary outcome was PONV incidence and severity within 48 hours postoperation. Randomization was computer-generated, and allocation was concealed in opaque envelopes. Outcome assessors and data collectors were blinded. The study was conducted from April 2023 to July 2024.\n\nResults: The esketamine group showed significantly lower PONV incidence in the PACU (57.3% vs 36%, p=0.014) and at 24 hours (53.3% vs 36%, p=0.048). PONV severity was reduced in the PACU (p<0.001), at 6 hours (p=0.042), and at 24 hours (p=0.029). Secondary outcomes favored esketamine, with lower dynamic pain scores during coughing (p=0.017 in PACU; p=0.021 at 6h; p=0.012 at 24h), reduced rescue analgesia needs (RD=0.12, p=0.037), and decreased incidence of bucking reflex (RD=0.21, p=0.014). No severe adverse events were reported.\n\nInterpretation: Single-dose esketamine significantly reduces PONV incidence and severity in GLS, improves dynamic analgesia, and mitigates extubation complications. These findings support esketamine as an effective opioid-sparing adjunct for PONV prevention in gynecological laparoscopy. Trial registration: ChiCTR2300075533. Funding: Not specified.",
