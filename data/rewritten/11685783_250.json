This study aimed to compare early postoperative outcomes between these approaches.\n\nMethods: This retrospective study was conducted at the University Hospital Center “Mother Theresa”, Tirana, Albania, including patients who underwent isolated aortic valve replacement between July 17, 2017, and July 30, 2024. Participants were adults requiring only aortic valve surgery, with 115 undergoing standard sternotomy and 53 undergoing mini-sternotomy. The primary outcome was early postoperative recovery, measured by ICU stay and mechanical ventilation duration. Data were analyzed using intention-to-treat.\n\nResults: The mean age was 62 ± 12.5 years. The mini-sternotomy group had significantly shorter ICU stays (39.92 ± 8.62 hours vs. 55.96 ± 32.56 hours, p < 0.001) and mechanical ventilation durations (5.82 ± 2.44 hours vs. 10.41 ± 14.68 hours, p = 0.030). Overall mortality was 1.2%, with no significant differences between groups. Adverse events were comparable between groups.\n\nInterpretation: Mini-sternotomy is as safe as standard sternotomy, offering shorter ICU stays and mechanical ventilation durations, potentially reducing hospital costs. The study was approved by the Ethics Council, University of Medicine, Tirana (approval number: 3265/Prot). No trial registration or funding source was reported.",
