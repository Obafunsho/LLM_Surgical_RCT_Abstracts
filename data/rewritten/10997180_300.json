A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Sacral Neuromodulation vs. Personalized Conservative Treatment for Refractory Idiopathic Slow-Transit Constipation: A Randomised Controlled Trial\n\nBackground: The effectiveness of sacral neuromodulation (SNM) for idiopathic slow-transit constipation (STC) is unclear due to conflicting evidence and suboptimal methodological quality.\n\nMethods: This multicenter, open-label, pragmatic randomised controlled trial was conducted in two Dutch hospitals. Participants aged 14-80 years with idiopathic STC, defecation frequency <3 per week, and refractory to maximal conservative treatment were included. Exclusion criteria included outlet obstruction and previous colon surgery. Participants were randomised in a 3:2 ratio to SNM (n=41) or personalized conservative treatment (PCT, n=26) using web-based minimization. The primary outcome was treatment success, defined as an average defecation frequency ≥3 per week, measured at 6 months. Secondary outcomes included constipation severity, fatigue, quality of life, and adverse events. Analysis was conducted on an intention-to-treat basis.\n\nResults: At 6 months, 22 of 41 (53.7%) SNM patients achieved treatment success compared to 1 of 26 (3.8%) PCT patients (odds ratio 36.4, 95% CI 3.4–387.5, P=0.003). SNM patients reported significantly lower constipation severity and fatigue scores and improved quality of life (P<0.001). Adverse events were reported in 32 SNM and 8 PCT patients, with 6 serious events in SNM and 2 in PCT. The most common SNM-related adverse events included persistent pain at the implantation site and tingling sensations.\n\nInterpretation: SNM is a promising treatment for refractory idiopathic STC, showing significant improvements in defecation frequency, constipation severity, fatigue, and quality of life compared to PCT. The trial highlights the potential of SNM as a viable option for patients unresponsive to conservative treatments. Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02961582. Funding: Not specified.",
