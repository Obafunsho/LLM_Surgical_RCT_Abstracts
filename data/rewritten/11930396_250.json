This study evaluates its effectiveness in such contexts.\n\nMethods: This randomised controlled trial included 29 studies, with 28 being placebo-controlled, double-blind trials and one comparing different rFVIIa doses. Participants were randomised to receive either rFVIIa or placebo. The primary outcome was mortality, with secondary outcomes including blood loss, red cell transfusion requirements, and thromboembolic events. Randomisation and allocation concealment methods were not specified. Blinding involved patients, clinicians, and outcome assessors.\n\nResults: A total of 4290 participants were randomised, with 2607 receiving rFVIIa. Prophylactic use in 1361 participants showed no mortality benefit (RR 1.04; 95% CI 0.55 to 1.97) but reduced blood loss (MD -297 mL; 95% CI -416 to -178) and transfusion needs (MD -261 mL; 95% CI -367 to -154). Therapeutic use in 2929 participants showed no significant mortality reduction (RR 0.91; 95% CI 0.78 to 1.06). Increased thromboembolic events were noted (RR 1.45; 95% CI 1.02 to 2.05).\n\nInterpretation: rFVIIa's effectiveness as a general haemostatic agent remains unproven, with increased arterial event risks. Use outside licensed indications should be limited to clinical trials.\n\nTrial registration: Not provided.\n\nFunding: Not specified.",
