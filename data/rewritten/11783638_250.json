A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Initial Propofol Bolus Doses in Different TCI Pumps\n\nBackground: Target-controlled infusion (TCI) pumps are used to deliver an initial bolus of propofol to achieve a target concentration. This study investigates whether differences exist in the initial bolus dose between different TCI pumps using the same pharmacokinetic (PK) model.\n\nMethods: This observational study was conducted in a laboratory setting at a German University Hospital from February 2019 to September 2020. Four TCI pumps were tested on 13 virtual patients with varying age, sex, height, and weight. The pumps were set to the Schnider model in effect-site mode with a target propofol concentration of 3.5 μg ml−1. Two pumps used a fixed equilibration rate constant (ke0) of 0.456 min−1, while the other two used a fixed time to peak concentration (tpeak) of 1.6 min. The primary outcome was the propofol bolus dose measured on a high precision scale.\n\nResults: Small differences in propofol bolus doses were observed in some simulations, while significant differences were found in others. For example, a virtual 60-year-old, obese man received 72.0 ± 1.0 mg with a Perfusor Space pump and 111.9 ± 1.2 mg with an Alaris pump (P < 0.001).\n\nInterpretation: Discrepancies in initial bolus doses can be attributed to differences in ke0. Anaesthetists should be aware of these differences in the implementation of the Schnider model, which could lead to disparities in the initial propofol bolus in some patients.",
