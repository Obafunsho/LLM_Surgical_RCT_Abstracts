A 300-word version\n\nBackground: Hemorrhagic transformation (HT) is a critical issue following ischemic stroke, especially in large vessel occlusion stroke (LVOS) intended for endovascular treatment (EVT). This study evaluates the infarct growth rate (IGR) as a predictor of HT compared to baseline infarct volume.\n\nMethods: A secondary analysis was conducted using data from two prospectively collected databases (FRAME 2017–2019 and ETIS 2015–2021). Eligible participants were patients with anterior circulation LVOS, witnessed symptom onset, baseline MRI within 24 hours, and available day 1 imaging. Exclusions included posterior circulation LVOS, medium and distal vessel occlusions, tandem occlusions, and unknown stroke onset. The primary outcome was any HT on day 1 imaging. Logistic regression models assessed the association between IGR and HT.\n\nResults: The study included 775 patients (mean age 70.5 years). The median IGR was 8.7 ml/hour. A faster IGR was independently associated with a higher risk of HT (adjusted OR 1.35; 95% CI 1.16–1.57). Baseline infarct volume was a stronger predictor of HT than IGR (p = 0.019). In univariate analysis, faster IGR was associated with increased parenchymal hemorrhage risk (OR 1.35; 95% CI 1.15–1.58), but this was not significant in multivariable analysis (adjusted OR 1.16; 95% CI 0.96–1.40).\n\nInterpretation: In patients with anterior circulation LVOS treated with EVT, IGR is associated with increased HT risk. However, baseline infarct volume is a more reliable predictor of HT. Further research is needed to explore the clinical implications of these findings.",
