A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Dexketoprofen/Tramadol for Postoperative Pain Management\n\nBackground: This study aimed to assess the analgesic efficacy and safety of a dexketoprofen/tramadol 25 mg/75 mg fixed-dose combination compared to dexketoprofen 25 mg and tramadol 100 mg in patients experiencing moderate-to-severe acute pain after total hip arthroplasty.\n\nMethods: Conducted as a multicentre, randomised, double-blind, double-dummy, placebo- and active-controlled trial, 641 patients aged 18–80 years were enrolled across 37 sites in 10 countries. Participants were randomised using an Interactive Voice/Web Response system with allocation concealment. The primary outcome was the mean sum of pain intensity differences (SPID) over 8 hours post-dose. The study period was from May 2013 to February 2014.\n\nResults: A total of 641 patients were randomised: 213 to dexketoprofen/tramadol, 214 to dexketoprofen, and 214 to tramadol. The mean SPID 8 values were 247 for dexketoprofen/tramadol, 209 for dexketoprofen, 205 for tramadol, and 151 for placebo. The combination was superior to dexketoprofen (P=0.019; 95% CI 6.4–73) and tramadol (P=0.012; 95% CI 9.5–76). Adverse drug reactions were low and similar across groups, with 2.8% in the combination group, 4.7% in the dexketoprofen group, and 5.1% in the tramadol group. Serious adverse reactions were rare, with two patients reporting five events.\n\nInterpretation: The dexketoprofen/tramadol combination demonstrated superior efficacy over its single components, even at higher doses of tramadol, with a safety profile consistent with known data for these agents in monotherapy.\n\nTrial registration: EudraCT 2012-004548-31; ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01902134.\n\nFunding: Menarini Group.",
