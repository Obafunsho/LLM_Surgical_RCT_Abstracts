A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Intraoperative Bleeding in LVAD Implantation: A Retrospective Cohort Study\n\nBackground: Continuous flow left ventricular assist devices (CF-LVADs) are crucial in managing advanced heart failure, but intraoperative bleeding remains a significant complication. This study aims to identify predictors of intraoperative bleeding, defined as the transfusion of 4 or more units of packed red blood cells during surgery.\n\nMethods: This single-center retrospective cohort study included adult patients aged 18 years or older who underwent CF-LVAD implantation at the University of Iowa Health Care between March 31, 2009, and May 1, 2024. Data collected included patient history, perioperative hemodynamics, echocardiography, operative details, mechanical circulatory support, antiplatelet use, and bleeding events.\n\nResults: Among 208 patients analyzed, 43 (20.67%) experienced intraoperative bleeding. Multilogistic regression analysis identified coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) pre-LVAD (odds ratio [OR] 2.98, confidence interval [CI] 1.2-7.42, p = 0.01) and temporary mechanical circulatory support (tMCS) pre-LVAD (OR 3.67, 95% CI 1.72-7.85, p < 0.001) as independent predictors of intraoperative bleeding. Intraoperative bleeding was associated with higher 90-day mortality (hazard ratio [HR] 10.4, p < 0.01, CI 95% 3.28-33.38).\n\nInterpretation: History of CABG and tMCS before LVAD implantation are significant predictors of intraoperative bleeding, which correlates with increased right ventricular failure and 90-day mortality. These findings highlight the need for careful preoperative assessment to mitigate bleeding risks.\n\nFunding: None.",
