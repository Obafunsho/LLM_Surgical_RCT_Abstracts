The primary outcome was postoperative pain measured by the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) and analgesic consumption, assessed over a 6-week period. Secondary outcomes included range of motion (ROM), swelling, and blood loss. Randomisation was computer-generated, and allocation was concealed. Blinding was not specified. A priori sample size calculation determined 50 subjects per group were needed to detect a 2-point difference on the VAS with 80% power.\n\nResults: At 6 weeks, no significant differences were observed in VAS scores or analgesic use between groups. However, the advanced cryotherapy group showed reduced flexion (114° vs. 120°). No adverse events were reported.\n\nInterpretation: Advanced cryotherapy did not demonstrate superior early recovery benefits compared to cold packs. The immobilization of the knee during cryotherapy may have contributed to reduced flexion. Larger sample sizes are needed to confirm these findings. Trial registration and funding details were not provided.",
