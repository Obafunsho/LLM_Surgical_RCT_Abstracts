A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of VTE Prophylaxis and Persistent Wound Drainage After Arthroplasty\n\nBackground: Persistent wound drainage following THA or TKA is a concern due to its link with prosthetic joint infection. This study investigates the association between VTE prophylaxis type (enoxaparin vs. aspirin) and persistent wound drainage.\n\nMethods: This secondary analysis of a cluster-randomized trial utilized data from the Australian Orthopaedic Association National Joint Replacement Registry. Two hospitals were randomized to administer aspirin (100 mg daily) or enoxaparin (40 mg daily) for 35 days post-hip arthroplasty and 14 days post-knee arthroplasty. Between April 2019 and December 2020, 1339 of 1679 eligible patients were included. Randomization was by hospital, with crossover after enrollment targets. Assessors were not blinded. Persistent wound drainage was defined as drainage beyond Postoperative Day 3. Logistic regression and Kruskal-Wallis tests were used for analysis.\n\nResults: No significant difference in persistent wound drainage was found between enoxaparin (9%) and aspirin (8%) groups (OR 1.2, 95% CI 0.8 to 1.8; p = 0.40). Enoxaparin was associated with a higher risk in subcuticular closure patients (OR 3.6, 95% CI 1.5 to 10.6; p = 0.009). No difference in median time to dry wound or joint-related reoperation risk was observed. Adverse events were not reported.\n\nInterpretation: Enoxaparin does not increase persistent wound drainage risk compared to aspirin, except in subcuticular closure cases. The short drainage duration and lack of increased reoperation risk support enoxaparin use. Trial registration: [Number]. Funding: [Source]. These findings should guide clinicians in VTE prophylaxis decisions post-arthroplasty.",
