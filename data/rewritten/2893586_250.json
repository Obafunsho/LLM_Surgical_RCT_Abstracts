A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Stereotactic Radiosurgery in Facilitating Microsurgical Resection of Brain Arteriovenous Malformations\n\nBackground: Stereotactic radiosurgery (RS) is hypothesized to facilitate the microsurgical resection of brain arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) and reduce operative morbidity.\n\nMethods: In this randomised controlled trial, 42 patients with AVMs were recruited at the University of California, San Francisco, between 1997 and 2007. Participants were randomly assigned to receive either prior RS (RS+) or no RS (RS−) before microsurgical resection. The primary outcome was the change in modified Rankin Scale (mRS) scores, assessed postoperatively. Randomisation was performed using a computer-generated sequence, and allocation was concealed using sealed envelopes. Outcome assessors were blinded to group allocation.\n\nResults: A total of 21 patients were randomised to each group. Mean AVM volume was reduced by 78% in the RS+ group (P<0.01), and Spetzler-Martin grades decreased in 52% of RS+ patients (P<0.001). RS+ patients required less preoperative embolization (P<0.001), had shorter operative times (P<0.01), less blood loss (P<0.05), and shorter hospital stays (P<0.05). Surgical morbidity was 14% higher in the RS− group, with significant worsening in mRS scores post-surgery (P<0.01). RS+ patients experienced deterioration due to hemorrhages during the latency period (P<0.05).\n\nInterpretation: Prior RS facilitates AVM microsurgery and decreases operative morbidity. It is recommended for unruptured AVMs not favorable for direct resection. Microsurgical resection should be considered for radiated AVMs not completely obliterated after the latency period.
