A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial Comparing Oxidized Zirconium and Stainless Steel Femoral Heads in Total Hip Arthroplasty\n\nBackground: This randomised controlled trial aimed to compare the wear rates of oxidized zirconium and stainless steel femoral heads in total hip arthroplasty (THA) using highly crosslinked polyethylene (HXLPE) and ultrahigh-molecular-weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) sockets.\n\nMethods: One hundred patients eligible for cemented THA were randomised to receive either oxidized zirconium or stainless steel femoral heads. UHMWPE was used in the first 50 patients, and HXLPE in the next 50. Randomisation was computer-generated, and allocation was concealed using sealed envelopes. The primary outcome was femoral head penetration, measured over a minimum follow-up of 4 years. Blinding was applied to outcome assessors. Complete follow-up data were available for 86 patients.\n\nResults: In the UHMWPE group, the median steady-state penetration rate was 0.03 mm/year for oxidized zirconium versus 0.11 mm/year for stainless steel (p < 0.001). In the HXLPE group, the rates were 0.02 mm/year for oxidized zirconium versus 0.05 mm/year for stainless steel (p < 0.001). Merle d’Aubigné scores showed no significant difference between groups. No adverse events were reported.\n\nInterpretation: Oxidized zirconium femoral heads demonstrated reduced wear compared to stainless steel in both UHMWPE and HXLPE sockets. The clinical significance of these findings requires further investigation with longer follow-up. Trial registration: [Trial registration number]. Funding: [Source of funding].",
