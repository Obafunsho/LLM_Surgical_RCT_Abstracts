A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Sanguineous vs. Crystalloid CPB Prime in Pediatric Cardiac Surgery\n\nBackground: The inflammatory response to cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) in pediatric patients is a significant challenge. This study investigates the impact of sanguineous CPB prime on inflammatory mediators at CPB initiation.\n\nMethods: In a post-hoc analysis of a prospective observational cohort study (NCT05154864), pediatric patients undergoing cardiac surgery with CPB were grouped by CPB prime type (sanguineous vs. crystalloid). Arterial samples were collected post-sternotomy and at CPB initiation. Luminex® measured concentrations of 24 inflammatory mediators. Statistical analyses were conducted using Mann-Whitney and Wilcoxon signed-rank tests.\n\nParticipants: Forty pediatric patients were enrolled at IWK Health Centre, Halifax, Canada, between August 2020 and June 2021. Eligibility criteria included weight <30 kg and exclusion of severe hematologic or multi-organ conditions.\n\nIntervention: Sanguineous prime (n=26) vs. crystalloid prime (n=14).\n\nOutcome: Primary outcome was the concentration of inflammatory mediators at CPB initiation.\n\nResults: Sanguineous prime contained supraphysiologic concentrations of complement mediators C2, C3, C3a, C3b, and C5a. Upon CPB initiation, patients receiving sanguineous prime exhibited significantly higher levels of C2, C3, C3b, C5, and C5a (p<0.001) compared to the crystalloid group. Cytokine and chemokine levels were trace in the sanguineous prime.\n\nInterpretation: Sanguineous prime accelerates the inflammatory response at CPB initiation in neonates and infants. Immunomodulatory interventions targeting complement during CPB prime preparation could benefit these patients.\n\nTrial registration: NCT05154864.\n\nFunding: Not specified.",
