  "abstract": "Title: A Double-Blind Randomised Controlled Trial Comparing Minimally Invasive and Classic Approaches in Total Hip Arthroplasty\n\nBackground: Minimally invasive surgery (MIS) for total hip arthroplasty (THA) involves smaller incisions and less muscle dissection compared to the classic approach (CLASS), potentially leading to faster rehabilitation. This study aims to evaluate whether MIS results in superior clinical outcomes compared to CLASS.\n\nMethods: This double-blind, randomised controlled trial was conducted at a single center, enrolling 120 patients eligible for primary noncemented THA between January 2005 and November 2007. Participants were randomly assigned to either the MIS or CLASS group using a block-randomised, stratified method based on surgical approach (anterolateral or posterolateral). The primary outcome was the Harris Hip Score (HHS) at 6 weeks postoperatively. Blinding was maintained for patients and outcome assessors. Analysis was performed on an intention-to-treat basis.\n\nResults: A total of 120 patients were randomised, with 60 in each group. At 6 weeks, the MIS group showed a statistically significant increase in mean HHS compared to the CLASS group (mean difference = 4.5, 95% CI 0.5 to 8.5; p = 0.03). This difference was primarily due to favorable results in the posterolateral MIS subgroup. The MIS group had longer surgical times and a higher, though not statistically significant, perioperative complication rate. Adverse events included six complications in the MIS group and two in the CLASS group.\n\nInterpretation: While MIS showed a statistically significant improvement in HHS at 6 weeks, the difference was not clinically relevant. The learning curve associated with MIS may contribute to increased operative time and complications. Trial registration: Not provided. Funding: Not specified.",
