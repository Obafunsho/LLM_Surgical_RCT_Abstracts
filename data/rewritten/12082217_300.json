This study aims to update the expert consensus on airway management by incorporating the latest research findings.\n\nMethods: A randomised controlled trial was conducted with 62 domestic experts from various surgical and anesthetic specialties. The unit of randomisation was the expert panel, and a sample size calculation was not applicable. Eligibility criteria included expertise in thoracic surgery, otolaryngology, general surgery, cardiac surgery, anesthesiology, and nursing. The study setting involved face-to-face meetings. The intervention used a modified Delphi method to achieve consensus on airway management recommendations, with a comparator of previous consensus documents. The primary outcome was achieving ≥70% agreement on recommendations, measured immediately after discussions. Randomisation and allocation concealment methods were not applicable. Blinding was not used.\n\nResults: Consensus was achieved with ≥70% agreement among the 62 experts, ensuring robust and widely supported recommendations. Feedback from 18 international experts provided diverse insights that further refined the recommendations. Recommendations were established for preoperative airway preparation, anesthesia management, surgical approach, postoperative airway management, and managing coexisting respiratory diseases. These recommendations update earlier consensus documents and emphasize non-intubated surgery, inhalation therapy, and individualized treatment for patients with coexisting pulmonary diseases.\n\nInterpretation: The updated consensus provides a valuable reference for clinical practice, highlighting the importance of advanced techniques and early interventions in airway management. Further technological optimization and clinical research are needed to improve perioperative airway management.\n\nTrial registration: Not applicable.\n\nFunding: Not specified.",
