A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial on Pharyngeal and Laryngeal Alterations in ABI Patients with Nasogastric and Tracheostomy Tubes\n\nBackground: This study investigates the impact of prolonged nasogastric tube (NGT) and tracheostomy on pharyngeal and laryngeal structures in acquired brain injury (ABI) patients.\n\nMethods: A retrospective analysis was conducted on 103 ABI patients with NGT indwelled for over 1 month, admitted to Huashan Hospital, Fudan University, from October 2019 to October 2023. Participants were divided into two groups based on tracheostomy status. Fiberoptic endoscopic examination of swallowing (FEES) assessed structural and functional changes. The primary outcome was the presence of structural abnormalities, measured at the time of FEES.\n\nResults: The NGT–TRACH group exhibited higher rates of epiglottis shape abnormality, glossoptosis, and pharyngeal stenosis compared to the NGT group (p < 0.05). No significant differences were found in other parameters. The study did not report adverse events.\n\nInterpretation: Prolonged NGT and tracheostomy are associated with significant structural changes in the pharynx and larynx, potentially impeding swallowing recovery. These findings suggest the need for tailored management strategies in ABI patients with long-term tube placement.",
