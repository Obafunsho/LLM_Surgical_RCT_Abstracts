A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Automated Temperature Management in Cardiopulmonary Bypass: A Randomised Controlled Trial\n\nBackground: Precise temperature management during cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) is crucial for optimizing patient outcomes. Traditional manual adjustments by perfusionists introduce variability, potentially leading to complications such as cerebral hyperthermia.\n\nMethods: This randomised controlled trial evaluated a novel automated temperature management system integrated with existing heater-cooler units (HCUs) and advanced perfusion systems. Participants were patients undergoing CPB, with eligibility criteria including age 18-75 and elective cardiac surgery. The study was conducted at a tertiary care hospital. The intervention group received automated temperature management, while the control group received standard manual management. The primary outcome was the incidence of cerebral hyperthermia, measured intraoperatively.\n\nResults: A total of 200 participants were randomised: 100 to the intervention and 100 to the control group. Analysis was conducted on 98 participants in the intervention group and 97 in the control group using an intention-to-treat approach. The automated system significantly reduced the incidence of cerebral hyperthermia (mean difference = 5.2%, 95% CI 3.1 to 7.3; p = 0.01). Adverse events were reported in 3% of the intervention group and 1% of the control group.\n\nInterpretation: The automated temperature management system demonstrated improved precision and reduced complications compared to manual management. This system could enhance patient safety and standardize CPB procedures.\n\nTrial registration: NCT12345678\n\nFunding: This trial was funded by the National Institute of Health.",
