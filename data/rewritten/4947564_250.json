A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of NIR Image-Guided Lymphatic Mapping in Esophageal Cancer\n\nBackground: This study evaluates the safety and feasibility of intraoperative, minimally invasive near-infrared (NIR) image-guided lymphatic mapping in esophageal cancer patients to improve staging and lymphadenectomy.\n\nMethods: A randomised controlled trial was conducted with 10 patients with resectable esophageal adenocarcinoma. Participants were enrolled at a single surgical center. Patients were randomised to receive either Indocyanine Green (ICG) alone or ICG pre-mixed with human serum albumin (ICG:HSA) via peritumoral, submucosal injection prior to resection. NIR imaging was performed in situ and ex vivo. The primary outcome was the identification of regional lymph nodes (LNs) within the surgical field, measured intraoperatively.\n\nResults: NIR imaging identified NIR+ regional LNs in 6 out of 9 patients, with 2–6 LNs detected per patient. NIR+ LNs were not identified in 4 cases: one patient with occult stage IV disease and 3 cases using ICG without HSA. The pathologic status of NIR+ regional LNs correlated with overall nodal status. No adverse events related to the intervention were reported.\n\nInterpretation: NIR lymphatic mapping using ICG:HSA is safe and feasible for identifying regional LNs in esophageal cancer. This technique may enhance histologic analysis of LN basins and improve detection of occult nodal disease. Further research is needed to optimize background signal reduction and local LN identification.\n\nTrial registration: [Trial registration number]\n\nFunding: [Source of funding]",
