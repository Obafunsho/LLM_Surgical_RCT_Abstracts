A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Enhanced Recovery After Surgery Protocols in Colorectal Surgery\n\nBackground: Enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) protocols are designed to minimize surgical stress and expedite recovery in colorectal surgery patients. This study evaluates the effectiveness of ERAS protocols compared to conventional care.\n\nMethods: This randomised controlled trial was conducted in multiple hospitals. Participants were adults undergoing elective colorectal surgery, with eligibility criteria including age 18-75 and ASA classification I-III. Randomisation was computer-generated, with allocation concealment via sealed envelopes. Blinding was applied to outcome assessors. The intervention group received ERAS protocols, while the control group received standard care. The primary outcome was the length of hospital stay (LOS), measured over 30 days post-surgery. Secondary outcomes included postoperative complications and gastrointestinal recovery.\n\nResults: A total of 200 participants were randomised: 100 to the ERAS group and 100 to the control group, between January 2020 and June 2021. Analysis included 98 participants in the ERAS group and 97 in the control group, using an intention-to-treat approach. The ERAS group had a significantly shorter LOS (mean difference = 2.5 days, 95% CI 1.8 to 3.2; p < 0.001). Postoperative complications were lower in the ERAS group (15% vs. 25%, p = 0.04). Gastrointestinal recovery was faster in the ERAS group, with earlier return of bowel function (mean difference = 1.2 days, 95% CI 0.8 to 1.6; p < 0.001). No severe adverse events were reported.\n\nInterpretation: ERAS protocols significantly reduce LOS, postoperative complications, and enhance gastrointestinal recovery in colorectal surgery patients. High compliance enhances outcomes, though implementation challenges remain. Future integration of prehabilitation and technology may further improve patient care.\n\nTrial registration: NCT01234567\n\nFunding: Supported by the National Institute of Health.",
