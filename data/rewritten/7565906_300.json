This study aimed to assess whether dobutamine administration results in greater graft perfusion than phenylephrine.\n\nMethods: This randomised crossover trial was conducted at the University Medical Centre Utrecht from September 2018 to July 2019. Ten adult patients undergoing cerebral bypass surgery were included. Patients were randomly assigned to receive dobutamine to increase cardiac index or phenylephrine to increase mean arterial pressure (MAP), targeting a >10% increase for each. The primary outcome was the absolute change in graft flow between the reference and intervention phases. Randomisation was performed using sealed opaque envelopes, and the anaesthesiologist was blinded to graft flow measurements. The study was registered at the Netherlands Trial Register (NL7077).\n\nResults: Graft flow increased with a median of 4.1 ml/min (IQR, 1.7–12.0) after dobutamine and 3.6 ml/min (IQR, 1.3–7.8) after phenylephrine (difference –0.6 ml/min; 95% CI, –14.5 to 5.3; P = 0.441). No treatment effect (0.9 ml/min; 95% CI, 0.0–20.1; P = 0.944) or carry-over effect was observed. One patient experienced a short episode of atrial arrhythmia during dobutamine administration, with no haemodynamic consequences. The analysis was conducted per-protocol.\n\nInterpretation: Both dobutamine and phenylephrine increased graft flow during cerebral bypass surgery, with no preference for one method over the other. The findings suggest that both agents can be used to enhance graft perfusion without significant adverse effects.\n\nTrial registration: Netherlands Trial Register, NL7077.\n\nFunding: Departmental sources.",
