A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Long-term Outcomes of Off-Pump vs On-Pump Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting: A Randomised Controlled Trial\n\nBackground: The long-term benefits of off-pump versus on-pump coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) remain controversial.\n\nMethods: This randomised controlled trial involved 2203 veterans from 18 VA medical centers, conducted from February 27, 2002, to May 7, 2007. Participants were randomly assigned to off-pump or on-pump CABG. The primary outcomes were all-cause death and a composite endpoint of death or subsequent revascularization over 10 years. Randomisation was performed centrally, and outcome assessors were blinded. Analyses were conducted using an intention-to-treat approach.\n\nResults: A total of 1104 patients were assigned to off-pump and 1099 to on-pump CABG. The 10-year death rates were 34.2% for off-pump and 31.1% for on-pump (relative risk, 1.05; 95% CI, 0.99-1.11; P = .12). The median time to the composite endpoint was shorter for off-pump (4.6 years) compared to on-pump (5.0 years; P = .03). No significant differences were found in secondary outcomes. Adverse events were not reported.\n\nInterpretation: No advantages were found for off-pump CABG in terms of 10-year mortality or revascularization. The time to the composite endpoint was shorter in the off-pump group. In the absence of contraindications, on-pump CABG remains the preferred technique.\n\nTrial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01924442\n\nFunding: The study was funded by the Department of Veterans Affairs.",
