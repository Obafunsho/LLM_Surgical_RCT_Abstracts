A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Patient-Specific Instrumentation in Total Knee Arthroplasty\n\nBackground: This randomised controlled trial aimed to evaluate whether patient-specific instrumentation (PSI) in total knee arthroplasty (TKA) improves patient-reported outcomes and gait compared to conventional instrumentation.\n\nMethods: Forty patients were randomised into two groups: PSI and conventional instrumentation. The study was conducted at a single orthopedic center. Eligibility criteria included patients scheduled for primary TKA. Randomisation was performed using a computer-generated sequence, and allocation was concealed using sealed envelopes. Blinding was applied to outcome assessors. The primary outcome was walking speed, measured using a 3-D gait analysis system, with a clinically important difference set at 0.1 m/second. Secondary outcomes included the New Knee Society Score (KSS), Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), and SF-12, assessed preoperatively and 3 months postoperatively. The study was powered at 90% to detect differences in walking speed and at 80% for KSS.\n\nResults: All 40 patients completed the study and were analyzed using an intention-to-treat approach. Both groups showed improvements in functional scores, quality of life, and gait parameters. However, no significant differences were found between the PSI and conventional groups in KSS, KOOS, SF-12, or gait parameters. No adverse events were reported.\n\nInterpretation: PSI does not provide a substantial advantage in early functional or gait outcomes after TKA. Further research is needed to assess long-term outcomes. Trial registration: [Registration number]. Funding: [Source of funding].",
