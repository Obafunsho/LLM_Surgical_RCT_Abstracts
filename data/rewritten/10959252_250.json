A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Folate Receptor-Targeted Intraoperative Molecular Imaging for Pulmonary Nodule Localization\n\nBackground: Intraoperative identification of pulmonary nodules, especially small lesions, is challenging. This study evaluates the safety and efficacy of folate receptor-targeted intraoperative molecular imaging using OTL38 in localizing pulmonary nodules during resection.\n\nMethods: This Phase I trial enrolled 20 subjects with biopsy-proven pulmonary adenocarcinomas at a single center. Participants received OTL38, a folate receptor-α targeted optical contrast agent. Tumors were imaged in situ and ex vivo, and fluorescence was quantified. Resected specimens were analyzed to confirm diagnosis, and FRα expression was quantified using immunohistochemistry. A multivariate analysis was conducted to identify variables impacting tumor fluorescence.\n\nResults: Three Grade I adverse events (transient nausea/abdominal pain) were observed, resolving post-infusion. Sixteen of 20 (80%) subjects had tumors with in situ fluorescence, with a mean tumor-to-background fluorescence level of 2.9 (IQR, 2.1 to 4.2). Four subjects' tumors fluoresced ex vivo. In situ fluorescence was dependent on depth from the pleural surface. Four subcentimeter nodules not identified on preoperative imaging were detected intraoperatively.\n\nInterpretation: OTL38 is safe with tolerable toxicity and accumulates in lung cancers, potentially improving identification of synchronous malignancies. A Phase II study is planned to further explore clinical implications.\n\nTrial registration: [Trial registration number]\n\nFunding: [Source of funding]",
