A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Hyperinsulinemic Normoglycemia in Cardiac Surgery\n\nBackground: Hyperinsulinemic normoglycemia may enhance myocardial glucose uptake and utilization. This study tested whether it reduces 30-day mortality and morbidity post-cardiac surgery.\n\nMethods: This dual-center, parallel-group, superiority trial randomized cardiac surgical patients at the Cleveland Clinic and Royal Victoria Hospital between August 2007 and March 2015. Participants were randomized to intraoperative glycemic management with either hyperinsulinemic normoglycemia (fixed high-dose insulin and variable glucose infusion targeting 80–110 mg·dL−1) or standard glycemic management (low-dose insulin targeting glucose >150 mg·dL−1). The primary outcome was a composite of 30-day mortality, mechanical circulatory support, infection, renal or neurologic morbidity. Randomization was computer-generated with allocation concealment. Blinding was not specified.\n\nResults: A total of 1,439 patients were randomized (709 to hyperinsulinemic normoglycemia, 730 to standard management). Analysis was intention-to-treat. The primary outcome occurred in 49 (6.9%) patients in the hyperinsulinemic group versus 82 (11.2%) in the standard group (P<0.0085); relative risk 0.62 (95% CI 0.39, 0.97), P=0.0043. Severe hypoglycemia (<40 mg·dL−1) occurred in 6 (0.9%) patients. A treatment-by-site interaction was noted.\n\nInterpretation: Intraoperative hyperinsulinemic normoglycemia reduced mortality and morbidity after cardiac surgery. Exogenous glucose targeting normoglycemia may be preferable to normalizing glucose concentrations. Trial registration: [Number]. Funding: [Source].",
