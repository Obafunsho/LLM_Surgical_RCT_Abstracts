  "abstract": "2. A 300-word version\n\nBackground: This study aimed to evaluate the cost implications associated with perioperative adverse outcomes following allogeneic blood transfusion (ABT) and intraoperative cell salvage (ICS) in surgical patients. Methods: This retrospective observational study was conducted at the Royal Brisbane and Women’s Hospital, Queensland, Australia, from 2016 to 2018. A total of 2129 surgical patients receiving blood transfusion were included: ICS only (n = 115), allogeneic red blood cells (RBCs) only (n = 1944), or RBCs and ICS (n = 70). Data were retrieved from eight hospital databases and linked using a novel Structured Query Language (SQL) database. Adverse outcomes associated with transfusion-related immune modulation (TRIM) were assessed using International Classification of Diseases-10 (ICD-10) coded data. Generalised linear models were used to model costs and adjust for confounding factors. Results: Most adverse outcomes (≥3) occurred following RBCs and ICS (37.1%), followed by RBCs (23.7%) and ICS (16.5%). The lowest marginal mean intensive care stay was after ICS (2.1 days, AUD 10,027), followed by RBCs and ICS (3.8 days, AUD 18,089), and then RBCs (5.5 days, AUD 26,071). The average cost per patient for blood products other than packed red blood cells was lowest for ICS (AUD 48), followed by RBCs (AUD 533) and RBCs and ICS (AUD 819). Interpretation: The study confirmed significant costs associated with ABT, with patients receiving RBCs experiencing more adverse outcomes and higher hospital costs than those receiving ICS. These results are limited to retrospective data and require further prospective validation. The findings suggest that ICS may offer cost-saving benefits by reducing adverse outcomes and associated healthcare costs, highlighting the need for further research to validate these observations in prospective studies.",
