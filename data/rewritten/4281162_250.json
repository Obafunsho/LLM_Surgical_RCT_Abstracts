This study evaluates the safety, feasibility, and immunogenicity of CMV pp65 mRNA-loaded autologous monocyte-derived dendritic cells (DC) as a vaccine.\n\nMethods: This randomised controlled trial included four CMV-seronegative healthy volunteers and three allogeneic HSCT recipients at Antwerp University Hospital. Participants received four weekly intradermal DC vaccines prepared from a single leukapheresis. The primary outcome was the induction of CMV-specific T-cell responses, assessed one month post-vaccination.\n\nResults: Three of four healthy volunteers showed de novo CMV-specific T-cell responses without serious adverse events. Among HSCT recipients, none developed CMV disease, and one patient exhibited a threefold increase in CMV pp65-specific T cells. Adverse events included transient local redness and mild swelling at the injection site, with no serious events reported in healthy subjects. One HSCT patient developed moderate grade II GVHD, requiring immunosuppressive treatment.\n\nInterpretation: The DC vaccination strategy effectively induced or expanded CMV-specific cellular responses in four of six efficacy-evaluable subjects, warranting further investigation in larger cohorts. The trial was not blinded, and randomisation details were not specified. The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Antwerp University Hospital, and all participants provided informed consent. Trial registration and funding details were not provided.",
