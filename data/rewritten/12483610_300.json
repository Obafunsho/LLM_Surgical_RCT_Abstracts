This study assesses the effect of complement inhibition on lung transplant success.\n\nMethods: Conducted at a tertiary care center, this randomised controlled trial included adults eligible for lung transplantation. Participants were randomised to receive either a complement inhibitor or standard care. Randomisation was computer-generated, with allocation concealment via sealed envelopes. Outcome assessors were blinded to group assignments.\n\nObjective: To determine the effect of complement inhibition on lung transplant outcomes.\n\nOutcome: The primary outcome was the incidence of primary graft dysfunction (PGD) within 72 hours post-transplant.\n\nResults: A total of 200 participants were randomised, 100 to the intervention and 100 to the control group, between January 2020 and June 2021. Analysis included 98 in the intervention group and 97 in the control group, using an intention-to-treat approach. The intervention group demonstrated a significant reduction in PGD incidence (mean difference = 15%, 95% CI 5% to 25%; p = 0.01). Adverse events were mild, with 3% in the intervention group and 1% in the control group experiencing gastrointestinal side-effects.\n\nInterpretation: Complement inhibition significantly reduces the incidence of PGD in lung transplant recipients, suggesting a potential therapeutic strategy to improve transplant outcomes. Further studies are needed to explore long-term effects and optimal dosing strategies.\n\nTrial registration: NCT12345678\n\nFunding: This trial was funded by the National Institutes of Health.",
