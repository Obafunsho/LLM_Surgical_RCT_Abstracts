Eligibility criteria included patients scheduled for THA or TKA at [insert study setting]. Participants were randomised to either the intervention or control group using a computer-generated sequence, with allocation concealment ensured. The intervention group received a standard preoperative class plus a joint-specific module addressing recovery during the first 12 months, while the control group received only the standard class. The primary outcome was the change in expectation scores, measured preoperatively before and after the class using validated hip-specific or knee-specific surveys. Blinding details were not specified.\n\nResults: In the THA trial, mean changes in expectation scores were +3.3 ± 8 for the intervention group (range, −22 to +32) and +4.9 ± 8 for the control group (range, −13 to +29). In the TKA trial, mean changes were −3.4 ± 10 for the intervention group (range, −26 to +33) and +2.4 ± 10 for the control group (range, −30 to +30). No adverse events were reported in either group.\n\nInterpretation: Preoperative educational classes can effectively modify patients' expectations of recovery from THA or TKA. The study was registered under trial number [insert number], and funding was provided by [insert source].",
