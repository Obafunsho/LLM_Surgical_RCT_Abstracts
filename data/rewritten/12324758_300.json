This study aimed to assess whether perioperative acetaminophen administration reduces the risk of postoperative AKI in adult cardiac surgery patients.\n\nMethods: A systematic review and meta-analysis were performed, including nine randomised controlled trials and four observational studies. The primary outcome was the incidence of postoperative AKI, measured during the hospital stay. Randomisation methods and allocation concealment were not consistently reported across studies. Blinding of outcome assessors, patients, and clinicians varied. The study was registered under PROSPERO (CRD42024514111).\n\nResults: A total of 11,583 patients were included, with 7,833 receiving acetaminophen and 3,750 in the control group. Acetaminophen administration was associated with a lower incidence of AKI [OR 0.62 (95% CI 0.40–0.97), P = 0.04]. Additionally, acetaminophen use was linked to reduced in-hospital mortality, delirium rates, and shorter ICU stays, though it had no significant effect on overall hospital length of stay. No significant adverse events were reported in either group.\n\nInterpretation: Perioperative acetaminophen administration may play a protective role in reducing AKI incidence and in-hospital mortality in patients undergoing cardiac surgery. These findings suggest that acetaminophen could be considered as a preventive measure before cardiopulmonary bypass initiation and in the postoperative period. However, further large multicenter randomised controlled trials are necessary to confirm these results. There was no funding source for this study.",
