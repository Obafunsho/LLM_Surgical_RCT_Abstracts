A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial Comparing Supra-Annular and Intra-Annular Aortic Valve Replacement\n\nBackground: This study aimed to evaluate the early outcomes of supra-annular versus intra-annular aortic valve replacement (AVR) in patients undergoing isolated AVR.\n\nMethods: Conducted at Kartal Kosuyolu High Specialization Training and Research Hospital, this retrospective observational study included 113 patients over 18 years who underwent isolated AVR between March 2013 and June 2019. Patients were divided into supra-annular (n=59) and intra-annular (n=54) groups. The primary outcome was the difference in postoperative complications and echocardiographic findings at one month. Due to the retrospective nature, randomisation and blinding were not applicable.\n\nResults: The supra-annular group had significantly longer cross-clamp (74.44±15.71 min) and cardiopulmonary bypass times (106.98±22.06 min) compared to the intra-annular group (48.31±13.21 min and 76.63±23.41 min, respectively; p<0.001). No significant differences were observed between the groups in terms of postoperative complications, including atrial fibrillation, pacemaker need, and cerebrovascular accidents. Echocardiographic findings, such as ejection fraction and pressure gradients, were also similar between the groups. Adverse events were comparable, with no significant differences in early mortality rates.\n\nInterpretation: The study found no significant differences in early postoperative outcomes between supra-annular and intra-annular AVR. Supra-annular positioning may be advantageous for patients with small annulus, but further prospective studies are necessary to confirm these findings. The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Kartal Kosuyolu High Specialization Training and Research Hospital. No trial registration or funding information was provided.",
