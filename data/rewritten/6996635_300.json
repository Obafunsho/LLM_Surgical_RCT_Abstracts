Patients aged 18 years and over scheduled for elective midline laparotomy were included. The intervention group received WHCO2 (37°C, 98% humidity), while the control group received standard care without gas insufflation. The primary outcome was the change in peritoneal inflammation and damage markers from the start (T0) to the end (Tend) of surgery. Randomisation was performed using an online tool, with allocation concealed in opaque envelopes. Patients and outcome assessors were blinded. \n\nResults: Of 40 patients randomised, 20 were allocated to WHCO2 and 19 to control. Analysis was per-protocol. Significant differences in log(Tend/T0) were found for IL-2 (5.3 vs. 2.8; P=0.028) and IL-4 (3.5 vs. 2.0; P=0.041). The 3-chlorotyrosine/tyrosine ratio increased by 1.1-fold in WHCO2 and 3.1-fold in control. Under light microscopy, peritoneum was visible in 19/20 WHCO2 samples compared to 11/19 control samples (P=0.006). Flatus passage was earlier in WHCO2 (2.5 vs. 5.0 days; P=0.008). No significant differences were observed in other clinical outcomes or adverse events. \n\nInterpretation: WHCO2 reduces some markers of peritoneal oxidative damage during laparotomy, with earlier flatus passage observed. The study was underpowered for surgical outcome analysis.\n\nTrial registration: NCT02975947.\n\nFunding: Not specified.",
