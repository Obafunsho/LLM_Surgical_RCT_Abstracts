Eligible participants were women aged 18 years or older who had undergone mastectomy and were seeking breast reconstruction, excluding those receiving postmastectomy radiotherapy. Participants were randomised 1:1 to receive either autologous fat transfer (AFT) plus expansion or 2-phased implant-based reconstruction (IBR). The primary outcome was quality of life (QoL) at 12 months post-surgery, measured by the BREAST-Q questionnaire. Randomisation was computer-generated, and allocation was concealed. Blinding was not applied.\n\nResults: A total of 193 participants were randomised, with 91 in the AFT group and 80 in the IBR group. Per-protocol analysis included 64 AFT and 68 IBR participants. AFT showed higher BREAST-Q scores in all domains, significantly in satisfaction with breasts (difference, 9.9; P = .002), physical well-being: chest (difference, 7.6; P = .007), and satisfaction with outcome (difference, 7.6; P = .04). The mean breast volume achieved was 300.3 mL for AFT and 384.1 mL for IBR. No significant differences in serious adverse events were observed between groups.\n\nInterpretation: AFT resulted in higher QoL compared to IBR, with no evidence of increased harm. This suggests AFT as a viable, less invasive option for breast reconstruction. The findings support the use of AFT as an alternative to traditional methods, providing patients with more options for post-mastectomy reconstruction.\n\nTrial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02339779\n\nFunding: Not specified.",
