Eligibility included COPD, asthma, recent lower respiratory tract infection, BMI ≥35 kg/m², or heavy smoking. The primary outcome was hospital length of stay, measured from surgery to discharge. Randomisation was computer-generated with allocation concealment via a centralised online system. Blinding was applied to surgical and nursing teams responsible for discharge decisions.\n\nResults: Median hospital length of stay was 7 days (IQR 6–9) in the HFNO group and 9 days (IQR 7–16) in the standard group (p=0.012). Geometric mean hospital stay was 29% lower in the HFNO group (95% CI 11–44%, p=0.004). ICU re-admissions were fewer in the HFNO group (1/49) compared to the standard group (7/45; p=0.026). No significant adverse events were reported.\n\nTrial registration: [Trial registration number]\n\nFunding: [Funding source]",
