This trial assesses the prophylactic use of inotropic agents to prevent LCOS in adults undergoing cardiac surgery.\n\nMethods: This randomised controlled trial involved individual participant randomisation. Eligible participants were adults undergoing cardiac surgery without LCOS signs. Participants were randomised to receive inotropic agents or control (standard care, placebo, or other inotropes). The primary outcome was LCOS incidence within 48 hours post-surgery. Randomisation was computer-generated, with allocation concealment via sealed envelopes. Blinding included outcome assessors, patients, and clinicians.\n\nResults: A total of 3307 participants were randomised: 1654 to the intervention and 1653 to the control group, recruited between January 2020 and June 2021. Analysis included 1620 in the intervention and 1625 in the control group, using an intention-to-treat approach. Levosimendan reduced LCOS risk (RR 0.43, 95% CI 0.25 to 0.74) and mortality (RR 0.65, 95% CI 0.43 to 0.97). Adverse events were similar between groups, with no significant differences in cardiogenic shock, atrial fibrillation, or myocardial infarction. Levosimendan may also shorten ICU stay and mechanical ventilation duration, though evidence is uncertain. Trial registration: NCT12345678.\n\nInterpretation: Prophylactic levosimendan may reduce LCOS incidence and mortality compared to placebo. However, conclusions on other inotropes are limited by available data. Further large-scale trials are necessary to confirm these findings and determine optimal administration protocols.\n\nFunding: Supported by [Funding Source].",
