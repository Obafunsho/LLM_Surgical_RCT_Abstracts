A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Forced-Air Warming Systems in Preventing Inadvertent Perioperative Hypothermia\n\nBackground: Inadvertent Perioperative Hypothermia (IPH) is a frequent complication in surgical patients, associated with adverse events such as infections and cardiac complications. This study assesses the effectiveness and efficiency of Forced-Air Warming (FAW) systems compared to no warming technology.\n\nMethods: This randomised controlled trial was conducted in a medium-large hospital in Northern Italy. Adult patients undergoing surgery lasting over 30 minutes were eligible. Participants were randomised to either the FAW group or the control group (no technology). The primary outcome was the incidence of IPH-related adverse events, measured postoperatively. Randomisation was computer-generated, and allocation was concealed. Blinding was applied to outcome assessors.\n\nResults: A total of 200 participants were randomised: 100 to the FAW group and 100 to the control group, between January 2020 and June 2021. Analysis was conducted on 98 participants in the FAW group and 97 in the control group using an intention-to-treat approach. The FAW group showed a significant reduction in surgical site infections (3% vs. 12%), cardiac events (3.5% vs. 7.6%), and blood transfusions (6.2% vs. 7.4%). The FAW system achieved a 16% cost saving per patient. Hospital stay was reduced by 15% to 26%, and social costs decreased by 30%. No severe adverse events were reported.\n\nInterpretation: The use of FAW systems significantly reduces IPH-related complications, hospital stay, and costs, supporting their implementation in surgical settings. The findings highlight the clinical and economic benefits of FAW systems, advocating for their adoption in routine surgical practice.\n\nTrial registration: [Trial registration number]\n\nFunding: The study was funded by [Funding source].",
