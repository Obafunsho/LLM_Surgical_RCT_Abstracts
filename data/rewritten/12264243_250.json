A 250-word version\n\nBackground: Hemorrhagic transformation (HT) is a significant complication following ischemic stroke, particularly in large vessel occlusion stroke (LVOS) intended for endovascular treatment (EVT). This study investigates the role of infarct growth rate (IGR) as a predictor of HT compared to baseline infarct volume.\n\nMethods: This secondary analysis utilized data from two prospectively collected databases (FRAME 2017–2019 and ETIS 2015–2021). Participants included patients with anterior circulation LVOS, witnessed symptom onset, baseline MRI within 24 hours, and available day 1 imaging. Exclusions were posterior circulation LVOS, medium and distal vessel occlusions, tandem occlusions, and unknown stroke onset. The primary outcome was any HT on day 1 imaging. Associations between IGR and HT were assessed using logistic regression models.\n\nResults: A total of 775 patients (mean age 70.5 years) were included. The median IGR was 8.7 ml/hour. Faster IGR was independently associated with higher HT risk (adjusted OR 1.35; 95% CI 1.16–1.57). Baseline infarct volume was a stronger predictor of HT than IGR (p = 0.019).\n\nInterpretation: In anterior circulation LVOS patients treated with EVT, IGR is associated with increased HT risk, but baseline infarct volume is a more robust predictor.",
