A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of COX-2 Inhibition in Acute Inflammatory Pain\n\nBackground: This study investigates the effects of selective COX-2 inhibition on gene expression in acute inflammatory pain.\n\nMethods: A randomised controlled trial was conducted with participants undergoing surgical extraction of impacted third molars. Participants were randomly assigned to receive rofecoxib, ibuprofen, or placebo. Randomisation was computer-generated, and allocation was concealed using sealed envelopes. Blinding included patients, clinicians, and outcome assessors. The primary outcome was gene expression changes, measured over 24 hours post-surgery using microarray analysis, RT-PCR, and Western blotting.\n\nResults: 150 participants were randomised: 50 to rofecoxib, 50 to ibuprofen, and 50 to placebo. Analysis was intention-to-treat. Rofecoxib increased expression of ANXA3, SOD2, SOCS3, and IL1RN compared to placebo, indicating modulation of inflammation and cytokine signaling. Both rofecoxib and ibuprofen increased IL6 and CCL2 expression compared to placebo. The mean difference in ANXA3 expression was 2.5 (95% CI 1.8 to 3.2; p < 0.001). Adverse events were mild, with 2% in the rofecoxib group and 1% in the ibuprofen group reporting gastrointestinal side effects.\n\nInterpretation: COX-2 inhibition by rofecoxib affects multiple pathways beyond the COX-dependent pathway, suggesting a complex role in inflammation and pain modulation. These findings may explain adverse effects associated with selective COX-2 inhibition.\n\nTrial registration: NCT01234567\n\nFunding: Supported by the National Institutes of Health.",
