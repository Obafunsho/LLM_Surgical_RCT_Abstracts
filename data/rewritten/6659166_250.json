A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial Assessing Tourniquet Application Proficiency Post-B-Con Training\n\nBackground: The Stop the Bleed campaign has trained over 500,000 laypeople in hemorrhage control, yet proficiency with various tourniquet types post-training remains unclear.\n\nMethods: This nonblinded, crossover, sequential randomised clinical trial with internal control was conducted at Gillette Stadium and the Longwood Medical Area in Boston, Massachusetts, from April 4, 2018, to October 9, 2018. A volunteer sample of 102 laypeople who completed the American College of Surgeons Bleeding Control Basic (B-Con) training was assessed. Participants were randomised using permutated blocks to apply five different tourniquet types. The primary outcome was correct tourniquet application, defined as applied pressure of ≥250 mm Hg within 2 minutes.\n\nResults: Participants correctly applied the Combat Application Tourniquet (CAT) at a significantly higher rate (92.2%) compared to other commercial tourniquets (Special Operation Forces Tactical Tourniquet, 68.6%; Stretch-Wrap-and-Tuck Tourniquet, 11.8%; Rapid Application Tourniquet System, 11.8%) and the improvised tourniquet (32.4%) (P < .001 for each comparison). All other tourniquet types resulted in higher estimated blood loss, longer application time, and less pressure than the CAT.\n\nInterpretation: B-Con training principles for CAT application do not fully translate to other tourniquet types, indicating a potential gap in preparedness for bleeding emergencies. No adverse events were reported. Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT03538379. Funding: Not specified.",
