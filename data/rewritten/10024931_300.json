Myxomas are the most common primary cardiac tumors, usually originating from the left heart chambers. Surgical resection is the standard treatment, but it is not always possible, especially in patients with significant comorbidities. This study aimed to assess the management of a pulmonary valve mass suspicious of being a myxoma in a patient with multiple comorbidities.\n\nMethods: Conducted in a hospital setting, this case study involved a 77-year-old male with chronic kidney disease, type 1 diabetes mellitus, and hypertension, who presented with a pulmonary valve mass. Due to the patient's poor surgical candidacy, a conservative management approach was adopted, involving high-risk staged percutaneous coronary intervention and dual antiplatelet therapy.\n\nResults: At six months follow-up, the patient experienced no complications such as stroke or pulmonary embolism. The echocardiogram showed a stable mass size and improved ejection fraction from 25% to 40-45%. The patient's constitutional symptoms also improved, indicating the potential effectiveness of conservative management in reducing thromboembolic and constitutional symptoms associated with cardiac myxomas.\n\nInterpretation: In patients who are poor surgical candidates, conservative management with antiplatelet therapy may be a viable option to manage cardiac myxomas, reducing thromboembolic and constitutional symptoms. This case highlights the need for further studies to establish guidelines for the non-surgical management of cardiac myxomas, particularly in patients with significant comorbidities.",
