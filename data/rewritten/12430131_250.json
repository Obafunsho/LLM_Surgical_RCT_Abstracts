A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Coenzyme Q10 Supplementation on Cognitive Function\n\nBackground: Cognitive decline is a growing concern with the aging population. Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10), an antioxidant, may improve biological mechanisms underlying cognitive decline. This study aims to evaluate the efficacy of CoQ10 supplementation on cognitive function.\n\nMethods: This review included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of CoQ10 supplementation on cognition. Participants were healthy or had specific diseases. The primary outcome was cognitive function, measured over various timeframes. Randomisation methods and allocation concealment were not specified. Blinding details were not provided.\n\nResults: Twelve studies demonstrated improved cognitive function, and two showed reduced oxidative stress with CoQ10 supplementation. Out of eight human RCTs, four showed beneficial effects on cognition, and two demonstrated increased cerebral blood flow. Disparities in results may be due to differing testing procedures and CoQ10 bioavailability.\n\nInterpretation: CoQ10 supplementation may positively impact cognition and its biological mechanisms. However, mixed results in human trials highlight the need for further research targeting specific mechanisms and using diverse cognitive assessments. Adverse events were not reported. Trial registration and funding sources were not provided.",
