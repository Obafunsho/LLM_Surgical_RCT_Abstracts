A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Hydrocortisone for Prevention of Postoperative Delirium in Digestive Surgery\n\nBackground: Postoperative delirium (POD) is a significant complication in digestive surgery, associated with increased hospital stays, costs, and mortality. This trial evaluates the effectiveness of hydrocortisone (HC) in preventing POD.\n\nMethods: This multicentre, randomised, blinded, placebo-controlled trial involves patients aged 65 and older undergoing digestive surgery at three hospitals in Japan. Eligible participants are randomly assigned to receive either 500 mg HC or placebo intravenously before surgery. The primary outcome is the incidence of POD from postoperative days 1 to 3, assessed using the Confusion Assessment Method-ICU (CAM-ICU). Secondary outcomes include changes in serum sodium levels, postoperative mortality, length of hospital stay, functional independence measures, and complications within 28 days. Randomisation is stratified by age, sex, disease stage, and procedure type, with allocation concealed via a web-based system. Blinding includes patients, surgeons, anaesthesiologists, and outcome assessors. The sample size calculation is based on detecting a reduction in POD incidence from 39.4% to 19.7%, requiring 180 participants.\n\nResults: As of May 2025, 61 of the planned 180 participants have been enrolled. No serious adverse events have been reported. The analysis will be conducted on an intention-to-treat basis.\n\nInterpretation: This trial aims to determine if preoperative HC administration reduces POD incidence. The results will inform clinical practice regarding POD prevention in digestive surgery, potentially improving patient outcomes and reducing healthcare costs.\n\nTrial registration: jRCTs041240032.\n\nFunding: The trial is supported by Nagoya University Hospital.",
