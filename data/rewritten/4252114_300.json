This study aimed to identify effective pharmacological interventions to accelerate the onset time of rocuronium.\n\nMethods: A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials were conducted. Trials were sourced from Medline, Embase, Cochrane Library, and clinicaltrials.gov. The primary outcome was the onset time of rocuronium-induced neuromuscular blockade. Statistical analyses were performed using RevMan5.2 and ADDIS 1.16.5. Mean differences (MDs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated.\n\nResults: Forty-three trials with 2,465 patients were included. The average onset time of rocuronium was 102.4±24.9 seconds. Effective interventions included rocuronium priming (MD −21.0 s, 95% CI −27.6 to −14.3 s), ephedrine pretreatment (MD −22.3 s, 95% CI −29.1 to −15.5 s), and magnesium sulphate pretreatment (MD −28.2 s, 95% CI −50.9 to −5.6 s). Statistical testing of indirect comparisons showed similar efficacy among these interventions. No significant adverse events were reported.\n\nInterpretation: Rocuronium priming, ephedrine, and magnesium sulphate pretreatments effectively reduce the onset time of rocuronium with similar efficacy. Priming with rocuronium is recommended for its convenience and efficacy. However, further trials are needed due to the large heterogeneities among different studies.\n\nTrial registration: Not specified.\n\nFunding: Not specified.",
