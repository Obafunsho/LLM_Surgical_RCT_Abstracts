A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Common-Iliac-Artery Skirt Technology in Iliac Artery Aneurysms\n\nBackground: This study investigates the effectiveness of a novel common-iliac-artery skirt technology (CST) compared to internal iliac artery embolization (IIAE) in managing iliac artery aneurysms.\n\nMethods: A retrospective analysis was conducted on 524 patients who underwent endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) from 2014 to 2020. Patients with iliac artery aneurysms treated with either CST or IIAE were included. The primary outcome was the technical success rate, defined as complete exclusion of aneurysms without endoleak. Secondary outcomes included surgery time, hospital stay, and major adverse events (MAEs). \n\nResults: Seventy-two patients were included, with 39 in the CST group and 26 in the IIAE group. CST showed a significantly shorter surgery time (97.42 ± 3.891 minutes vs. 141.0 ± 8.010 minutes, p < 0.001) and hospital stay (15.35 ± 0.873 days vs. 19.32 ± 1.067 days, p = 0.009). The CST group had lower in-hospital MAEs (0% vs. 11.5%, p = 0.059) and 1-year follow-up MAEs (6.7% vs. 28.6%, p = 0.052). No significant differences in mortality or long-term MAEs were observed. Buttock claudication rates were lower in the CST group (20.5% vs. 46.2%, p = 0.053), with comparable erectile dysfunction rates (10.3% vs. 23.1%, p = 0.352). Subgroup analysis of patients with internal iliac artery aneurysms showed no differences in mortality, stent MAEs, sac dilation, or reintervention rates.\n\nInterpretation: CST is a feasible and effective alternative to IIAE for iliac artery aneurysms, offering reduced surgery time and hospital stay with comparable safety outcomes.\n\nTrial registration: Not provided.\n\nFunding: Supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China and the Natural Science Foundation of Hunan Province.",
