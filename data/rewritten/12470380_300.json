This study assesses the impact of transversus abdominis plane (TAP) blocks on peri-operative analgesic use and side effects.\n\nMethods: Conducted at Wellstar MCG, Augusta University, Georgia, USA, this retrospective study included 100 adult patients undergoing deceased donor kidney transplant, excluding those with opioid dependence. Patients were divided into two groups: Group A received ultrasound-guided TAP blocks, and Group B did not. The primary outcome was the use of intra-operative and post-operative analgesia up to 24 hours post-surgery. Secondary outcomes included post-operative nausea, vomiting, and pruritus. Data were analyzed using chi-square and Fisher’s exact tests.\n\nResults: Fifty patients were included in each group. Group A demonstrated a statistically significant reduction in intra-operative fentanyl use (p = 0.04). No significant differences were observed in post-operative hydromorphone (p = 0.665), oxycodone (p = 0.75), or acetaminophen (p = 0.64) use. Additionally, no differences were found in post-operative nausea (p = 0.766), vomiting (p = 0.436), or pruritus. No complications were recorded from TAP block use.\n\nInterpretation: TAP blocks are a safe and effective method for reducing intra-operative opioid use in kidney transplant recipients, although they do not influence post-operative analgesic requirements or side effects within 24 hours post-surgery. The study highlights the need for further randomized controlled trials to explore the potential benefits of TAP blocks in this patient population, including the use of continuous blocks and different anesthetic agents. These findings contribute to the development of personalized pain management strategies for kidney transplant recipients.",
