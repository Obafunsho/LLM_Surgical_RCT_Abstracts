A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Morphine in Preterm Neonates Undergoing Endotracheal Tube Suctioning\n\nBackground: The relationship between plasma morphine concentrations and neonatal responses to endotracheal tube (ETT) suctioning in preterm neonates is unclear.\n\nMethods: In a multicenter, double-blind, randomised controlled trial, 898 ventilated preterm neonates from 16 centers were randomly assigned to receive either placebo (n=449) or morphine (n=449). Eligibility criteria included preterm neonates requiring mechanical ventilation. Following an i.v. loading dose of 100 µg/kg, morphine infusions were administered based on postmenstrual age (PMA) for up to 14 days. Open-label morphine was provided for pain or agitation. Randomisation was computer-generated, and allocation was concealed. Blinding included outcome assessors, patients, and clinicians. The primary outcome was the neonatal response to ETT suctioning, measured at 20–28 and 70–76 hours after starting the drug infusion and 10–14 hours after discontinuation.\n\nResults: A total of 875 neonates were analyzed using a non-linear mixed effects model. Morphine clearance was 50% of the mature value at 54.2 weeks PMA, increasing from 2.05 to 6.04 litre/h/70 kg between 24 and 32 weeks PMA. The volume of distribution was 190 litre/70 kg. No significant relationship was found between morphine concentrations and heart rate changes or the Premature Infant Pain Profile. No adverse events were reported.\n\nInterpretation: Morphine does not alter the neonatal response to ETT suctioning. The maturation of morphine clearance is delayed in preterm neonates.
