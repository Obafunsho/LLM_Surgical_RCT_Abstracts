A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Goal Attainment Scaling-Based Rehabilitation in Knee Arthroplasty: A Randomised Controlled Trial\n\nBackground: This study aimed to assess whether goal attainment scaling (GAS)-based rehabilitation enhances satisfaction with postoperative activities in patients undergoing knee arthroplasty (KA) compared to standard rehabilitation.\n\nMethods: Conducted as a single-center randomised controlled trial, the study included patients younger than 65 years, working outside the home, and scheduled for unicompartmental or total KA. The trial took place at a regional teaching hospital. A total of 120 patients were randomised 1:1 to either GAS-based rehabilitation or standard rehabilitation. GAS-based rehabilitation involved preoperative development of personal activity goals with a physiotherapist, while standard rehabilitation consisted of regular outpatient physiotherapy. The primary outcome was satisfaction with activities of daily living, work, and leisure-time activities, measured using visual analogue scales (VAS) at 1 year postoperatively. Randomisation was performed using block randomisation with allocation concealment via sequentially numbered opaque envelopes. Participants, researchers, and physiotherapists were unblinded.\n\nResults: A total of 60 patients were randomised to each group, with 53 in the GAS group and 58 in the control group analysed using an intention-to-treat approach. Satisfaction with work activities was significantly higher in the GAS group (β = 10.7 points, 98% CI = 2.0 to 19.4 points). No differences were found for activities of daily living or leisure-time activities. No adverse events were reported.\n\nInterpretation: Personalized, goal-specific rehabilitation using GAS resulted in higher patient satisfaction with work activities compared to standard rehabilitation 1 year after KA. The findings suggest that GAS-based rehabilitation may be beneficial for improving work-related satisfaction in younger, active patients undergoing KA.\n\nTrial registration: NTR5251\n\nFunding: Not specified.",
