A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Preoperative Inorganic Nitrate in Cardiac Surgery\n\nBackground: Nitric oxide (NO) is a key cardiovascular signalling molecule with protective properties in ischaemia–reperfusion injury. This study evaluated whether preoperative inorganic nitrate administration could reduce troponin T release and other organ injury biomarkers in cardiac surgery patients.\n\nMethods: This single-centre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was conducted at a Swedish hospital. Participants were 82 patients aged 18-80 years undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting with cardiopulmonary bypass. Exclusion criteria included pregnancy, re-do surgery, and significant organ disease. Patients were randomised in blocks of four to receive either oral sodium nitrate (700 mg×2) or placebo (NaCl) before surgery. The primary outcome was troponin T release over 72 hours postoperatively. Randomisation and allocation were concealed, and all participants, clinicians, and outcome assessors were blinded.\n\nResults: A total of 95 patients were randomised, with 42 in the placebo group and 40 in the nitrate group completing the study. Plasma nitrate and nitrite levels were elevated in the nitrate group. The 72-hour troponin T release did not differ significantly between groups (p=0.19). Other organ injury biomarkers were also similar. Perioperative bleeding was 18% less in the nitrate group (p=0.03). No significant adverse events were reported.\n\nInterpretation: Preoperative inorganic nitrate administration did not reduce troponin T release or other organ injury biomarkers in cardiac surgery. The observed reduction in perioperative bleeding warrants further investigation.\n\nTrial registration: NCT01348971.\n\nFunding: The study was funded by institutional grants.",
