Participants were 40 American Society of Anesthesiologists grade I and II patients aged 18-60 years. Exclusion criteria included risk of aspiration, limited mouth opening, and certain medical conditions. Patients were randomly allocated into two groups: Group I (Index Finger) and Group T (Thumb Insertion), with 20 patients each. Randomisation was achieved using sealed numbered envelopes. The primary outcome was ease of insertion, assessed immediately post-insertion. Secondary outcomes included fiberoptic laryngoscopic position, cuff pressures, and laryngopharyngeal morbidity. Blinding was maintained for outcome assessors.\n\nResults: Both groups were comparable in terms of ease of insertion, fiberoptic view scores, cuff pressures, and laryngopharyngeal morbidity. No significant differences were observed between the groups. The mean time for insertion was 29.00 seconds for Group I and 34.00 seconds for Group T, with no statistical significance. No adverse events were reported.\n\nInterpretation: The thumb insertion technique is as effective as the index finger technique for LMA Classic™ insertion, providing comparable outcomes in terms of ease of insertion and patient safety. This technique may be beneficial in situations where access to the head end of the patient is limited.\n\nTrial registration: Not provided.\n\nFunding: Not reported.",
