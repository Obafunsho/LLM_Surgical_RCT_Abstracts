A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial on Amiodarone for POAF Prevention in CABG Patients\n\nBackground: Postoperative atrial fibrillation (POAF) is a common complication after cardiac surgery, increasing morbidity and healthcare costs. This study evaluates the effect of amiodarone on POAF incidence and onset timing in moderate and high-risk patients undergoing elective coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG).\n\nMethods: This randomised controlled trial included 454 patients at Medical Institute Bayer, Tuzla, from 2019 to 2024. Patients were stratified using the McSPI AF Risk Index, POAF Score, and CHA2DS2-VASc Score. Moderate and high-risk patients received amiodarone with beta blockers (Amiodarone group), while low-risk patients received beta blockers only. The primary outcome was POAF incidence, measured over the hospital stay. Randomisation was computer-generated, with allocation concealment via sealed envelopes. Blinding was not applied.\n\nResults: 227 patients were randomised to each group. POAF occurred in 5.95% of the Amiodarone group versus 9.25% in the beta blocker group. The relative risk reduction was 27% (RR = 0.27, 95% CI = 0.105-0.689, p = 0.006). Kaplan-Meier analysis showed delayed POAF onset in the Amiodarone group (median: 48h vs. 33h, p = 0.0007). No significant adverse events were reported.\n\nInterpretation: Amiodarone combined with beta blockers reduces POAF incidence and delays its onset after CABG. Trial registration: N/A.
