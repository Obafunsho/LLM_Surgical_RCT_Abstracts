A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial on KRAS Mutations and Rectal Cancer Response to Chemoradiation Therapy\n\nBackground: Mutations in KRAS and TP53 are prevalent in colorectal cancer and linked to therapy resistance. This study aimed to correlate specific KRAS mutations with rectal cancer response to neoadjuvant chemoradiation therapy (CRT) and explore the association with TP53 mutations.\n\nMethods: In this randomised controlled trial, 148 stage II–III rectal cancer patients were enrolled. Eligibility criteria included histologically confirmed rectal cancer. Participants underwent pre-operative CRT followed by surgery. DNA was extracted from pretreatment tumor biopsies and paired normal surgical tissues for KRAS and TP53 genotyping. The primary outcome was pathologic complete response (pCR) measured post-surgery. Randomisation and allocation concealment methods were not specified. Blinding details were not provided.\n\nResults: Sixty patients had KRAS mutations; 12 in codon 13, and 48 in other locations. Eighty patients had TP53 mutations; 27 had concurrent KRAS/TP53 mutations. Tumors with any KRAS mutation were less likely to achieve pCR compared to wildtype KRAS (p=0.006). Specifically, no tumors with KRAS codon 13 mutations achieved pCR (p=0.03). Tumors with KRAS codon 13 mutations had a higher incidence of concurrent TP53 mutations (p=0.02).\n\nInterpretation: Different KRAS codon mutations may variably affect rectal cancer resistance to CRT, potentially due to differing TP53 mutation frequencies. Further research is needed to understand these interactions.\n\nTrial registration: Not provided. Funding: Not specified.",
