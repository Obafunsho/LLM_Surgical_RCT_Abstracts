This study investigates whether MIS TKA results in greater knee strength compared to standard TKA.\n\nMethods: This randomised controlled trial was conducted at a single center. Participants were adults eligible for TKA, matched for age, weight, height, BMI, sex, and surgically treated side. Fifty-two patients were randomised to receive either MIS or standard TKA. The primary outcome was knee extensor torque, measured preoperatively and at 8 weeks postoperatively using isokinetic tests. Randomisation was computer-generated, and allocation was concealed. Blinding was applied to outcome assessors. Secondary outcomes included knee scores, alignment, ROM, tourniquet and operating times, and hospital length of stay.\n\nResults: Baseline extensor torques were 57 Nm for MIS and 53 Nm for standard TKA. At 8 weeks, mean postoperative extensor torques were 47 Nm for MIS and 45 Nm for standard TKA. The postoperative-to-preoperative ratios were 0.8 for both groups. The extensor-flexor torque ratios were similar. No significant differences were observed in secondary outcomes. Adverse events were not reported. The analysis was conducted on an intention-to-treat basis.\n\nInterpretation: MIS TKA does not significantly enhance postoperative quadriceps strength compared to standard TKA. The study was registered under trial number [insert trial registration number]. Funding was provided by [insert funding source]. These findings suggest that less invasive dissection of the extensor apparatus in MIS TKA does not confer additional benefits in terms of muscle strength recovery. Further research may explore other potential advantages of MIS TKA.",
