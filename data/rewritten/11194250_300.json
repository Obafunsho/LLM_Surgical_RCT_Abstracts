This study evaluates the impact of unregulated distension pressure on LSVG endothelium.\n\nMethods: A prospective, single-center randomised controlled trial was conducted with 21 paired vein samples from CABG patients, randomised into non-distended (group A) and distended (group B) groups. Histological and CD31 immunohistochemical analyses assessed endothelial cell loss. Pressure was recorded using different syringe sizes. Randomisation was computer-generated, and allocation was concealed. Outcome assessors were blinded. The primary outcome was endothelial cell loss, measured immediately post-procedure.\n\nResults: Distended veins exhibited significantly higher endothelial cell loss (31.95% ± 31.31) compared to non-distended veins (11.67% ± 28.65) (p = 0.034). CD31 immunohistochemistry corroborated greater loss in distended veins (p = 0.001). Pressure with a 20-cc syringe was lower (44.5 mmHg) than with a 10-cc syringe (92.75 mmHg), highlighting the inverse relationship between syringe size and pressure. Pre-existing endothelial injury was observed in 36% of diabetic patients. No adverse events were reported.\n\nInterpretation: Unregulated distension pressure during LSVG preparation is associated with increased endothelial damage, emphasizing the need for controlled distension to maintain graft integrity. The study underscores the importance of syringe size in pressure regulation. Trial registration: [Number]. Funding: [Source].",
