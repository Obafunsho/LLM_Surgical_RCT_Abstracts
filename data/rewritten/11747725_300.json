A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Gastric Partitioning versus Gastrojejunostomy for Malignant Gastric Outlet Obstruction\n\nBackground: This randomised controlled trial aimed to compare the efficacy of gastric partitioning versus gastrojejunostomy in patients with gastric outlet obstruction due to unresectable distal gastric tumours.\n\nMethods: Conducted at a single centre, the trial included patients aged 18-85 with obstructive, unresectable distal gastric adenocarcinoma. The primary outcome was the acceptance of a full diet (GOOS 3) at discharge. Randomisation was performed using computer-generated software, with allocation concealed until after consent. The trial was open-label, with no blinding of participants or clinicians.\n\nResults: Between August 2013 and April 2020, 90 patients were randomised: 46 to gastrojejunostomy and 44 to gastric partitioning. After exclusions, 25 in the gastrojejunostomy group and 27 in the partitioning group were analysed per-protocol. Acceptance of a normal diet was significantly higher in the partitioning group (96% vs. 72%; p = 0.022). No significant differences were observed in surgery duration, hospital stay, postoperative complications, or 30- and 90-day mortality rates. The partitioning group had more frequent red blood cell transfusions (81% vs. 52%; p = 0.024). Multivariable analysis indicated that inability to eat a full diet (p = 0.035) and absence of palliative chemotherapy (p = 0.001) were associated with worse survival. The median overall survival was 5.3 months for the gastrojejunostomy group and 12.4 months for the partitioning group (p = 0.154).\n\nInterpretation: Gastric partitioning resulted in better oral diet acceptance compared to gastrojejunostomy, with no significant difference in postoperative complications or long-term survival. The study highlights the importance of achieving a full diet and receiving palliative chemotherapy for improved survival.\n\nTrial registration: NCT02065803, clinicaltrials.gov\n\nFunding: Not specified.",
