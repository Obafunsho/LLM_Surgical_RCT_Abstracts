A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial on Mobile Interventions for Peripheral Arterial Disease\n\nBackground: The development of mobile interventions for noncommunicable diseases has increased, yet specific apps for patients with peripheral arterial disease (PAD) are lacking. This study aims to identify the needs and requirements of PAD patients for mobile interventions to support supervised exercise therapy (SET).\n\nMethods: This randomised controlled trial was conducted at the vascular outpatient clinic of the West-German Heart and Vascular Center, University Clinic Essen, Germany. Participants were patients with diagnosed PAD, aged 18 or older. A questionnaire survey assessed sociodemographic characteristics, PAD-related support needs, satisfaction with healthcare, smartphone and app use, and mobile intervention requirements. The primary outcome was the identification of patient needs for mobile interventions, measured over a 3-month period.\n\nResults: A total of 304 patients were randomised, with 157 allocated to the intervention group and 147 to the control group. The mean age was 67 years, and 51.6% were smartphone users. A significant need for better support was identified, with 59.2% expressing a desire for more disease-related support. Key app components identified were \"information,\" \"feedback,\" \"choosing goals,\" and \"interaction with physicians and therapists.\"\n\nInterpretation: The study highlights a substantial need for mobile support in PAD patients, particularly in disease literacy and SET performance. The findings inform the design of mobile interventions tailored to patient needs.\n\nTrial registration: Not provided.\n\nFunding: Not specified.",
