A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Device-Based Therapies for Hypertension Management\n\nBackground: Hypertension is a leading modifiable risk factor for cardiovascular mortality, affecting over 1.3 billion people globally. Despite available antihypertensive drugs, many patients remain uncontrolled, necessitating alternative treatments.\n\nMethods: This randomised controlled trial evaluated the efficacy of device-based therapies in managing hypertension. Participants were adults with resistant hypertension, recruited from multiple clinical centers. The intervention group received catheter-based renal denervation (RDN), while the control group received standard antihypertensive medication. Randomisation was computer-generated, with allocation concealment ensured by sealed envelopes. Blinding was applied to outcome assessors.\n\nObjective: To assess the effectiveness of RDN in reducing blood pressure compared to standard treatment.\n\nOutcome: The primary outcome was the change in systolic blood pressure (SBP) over six months.\n\nResults: A total of 200 participants were randomised: 100 to the RDN group and 100 to the control group. Analysis was conducted on 98 participants in the RDN group and 97 in the control group using an intention-to-treat approach. The RDN group showed a significant reduction in SBP (mean difference = 5.2 mm Hg, 95% CI 3.1 to 7.3; p = 0.01). Adverse events were mild, with 3% in the RDN group and 1% in the control group experiencing side effects.\n\nInterpretation: RDN significantly reduces SBP in patients with resistant hypertension, offering a promising alternative to standard treatment.\n\nTrial registration: NCT12345678\n\nFunding: This trial was funded by the National Institutes of Health.",
