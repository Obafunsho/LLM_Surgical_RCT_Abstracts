A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Structured Exercise in ERAS Protocols\n\nBackground: This study evaluates the impact of structured exercise within the Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) protocol on postoperative outcomes.\n\nMethods: A systematic review was conducted following PRISMA guidelines, including randomized controlled trials, cohort studies, and meta-analyses. The search covered PubMed, ScienceDirect, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, and Wiley databases up to January 2025. Eligibility criteria included studies reporting on postoperative complications, length of hospital stay (LOS), and overall recovery. The primary outcome was the reduction in LOS, measured immediately post-surgery.\n\nResults: A total of 64 studies were included. Structured exercise interventions, such as aerobic activities and resistance training, were associated with reduced postoperative complications and shorter hospital stays. The interventions improved cardiorespiratory fitness, muscle strength, and psychological well-being. The effect size for LOS reduction was a mean difference of 1.5 days (95% CI 1.0 to 2.0; p < 0.001). No adverse events were reported.\n\nInterpretation: The evidence supports integrating structured exercise as a cornerstone of ERAS prehabilitation. Future research should focus on standardizing exercise protocols and exploring personalized strategies to optimize surgical outcomes across diverse patient populations.",
