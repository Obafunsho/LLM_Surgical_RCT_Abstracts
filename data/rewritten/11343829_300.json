A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Allopurinol in Neonates with CCHD Undergoing Cardiac Surgery\n\nBackground: The CRUCIAL trial (NCT04217421) is a phase III, randomised, quadruple-blinded, placebo-controlled trial investigating the effect of postnatal and perioperative allopurinol on postoperative brain injury in neonates with critical congenital heart disease (CCHD) undergoing cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB).\n\nMethods: Fourteen neonates with prenatal CCHD diagnosis were randomised to receive either allopurinol or placebo. Allopurinol was administered intravenously at 20 mg/kg up to five times. The primary outcome was the pharmacokinetics (PK) of allopurinol and oxypurinol, measured over the preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative phases. Randomisation was performed by Ace Pharmaceuticals using blocking, and allocation was concealed. Blinding included outcome assessors, patients, and clinicians.\n\nResults: A two-compartment model for allopurinol and a one-compartment model for oxypurinol best described the PK. In a typical neonate weighing 3.5 kg, allopurinol clearance (CL) increased from 0.95 L/h at birth to 2.97 L/h pre-CPB, decreased to 1.38 L/h during CPB, and increased to 2.21 L/h post-CPB. Oxypurinol CL increased from 0.21 L/h at birth to 0.41 L/h pre-CPB, decreased to 0.12 L/h during CPB, and dropped to 0.05 L/h post-CPB. Target attainment was 100% at 24 h postnatally, 53.8% at 24 h after CPB start, and 100% at 36 h post-surgery. The combined concentrations of allopurinol and oxypurinol maintained ≥ 90% inhibition of xanthine oxidase (IC90 XO) throughout the postnatal and perioperative period. No adverse events were reported.\n\nInterpretation: The minimal target concentration of allopurinol was not achieved at every predefined time interval in the CRUCIAL trial; however, the dosing strategy used was deemed adequate, since it yielded concentrations well exceeding the IC90 XO. The decreased CL of both compounds during CPB suggests influence of hypothermia, hemofiltration, and potential sequestration of allopurinol in the circuit.\n\nTrial registration: NCT04217421\n\nFunding: Not specified.",
