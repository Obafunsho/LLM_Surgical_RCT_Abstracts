A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Intraperitoneal Chemotherapy with Raltitrexed in Stage III Colorectal Cancer\n\nBackground: This study aimed to evaluate the effect of intraperitoneal chemotherapy (IPC) with raltitrexed on survival in patients with stage III colorectal cancer (CRC).\n\nMethods: A total of 195 patients with stage III CRC, aged 18 to 80, were recruited from The First Affiliated Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University between June 2017 and June 2018. Patients were randomly assigned to either the observation group, receiving IPC with raltitrexed during laparoscopic radical resection, or the control group, receiving standard surgery without IPC. The primary outcome was progression-free survival (PFS), measured from surgery to disease progression or death. Overall survival (OS) was also assessed. Randomisation and allocation concealment methods were not specified. Blinding was not implemented.\n\nResults: Of the 195 patients, 100 were randomised to the observation group and 95 to the control group. Analysis was conducted on all participants using an intention-to-treat approach. The observation group showed significantly improved PFS (χ² = 5.416, p = 0.020) and OS (χ² = 4.673, p = 0.031) compared to the control group. No adverse events were reported.\n\nInterpretation: IPC with raltitrexed during laparoscopic radical resection significantly improves PFS and OS in stage III CRC patients. Further multicenter trials are needed to confirm these findings.\n\nTrial registration: Not provided.\n\nFunding: Not specified.",
