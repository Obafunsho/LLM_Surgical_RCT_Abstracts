While checkpoint inhibition has shown promise in non-CNS cancers, predicting responders in glioblastoma remains difficult. OBJECTIVE: To determine the proportion of patients with increased interferon gamma levels in brain tumor tissue after nivolumab and evaluate the safety of brain tumor microdialysis for immune response monitoring, alongside assessing the safety of anti-PD-1 and anti-LAG-3 checkpoint inhibition. METHODS: This single-center, nonrandomized phase 1 trial enrolled up to 15 adult patients with recurrent glioblastoma, aiming for 10 completions over 18 months. Participants underwent biopsy, microdialysis catheter and lumbar drain placement, anti-PD-1 treatment, immune biomarker collection, tumor resection, and anti-PD-1 and anti-LAG-3 treatment until progression. RESULTS: Interferon gamma levels increased in treated patients as measured by microdialysis. Microdialysis was safe, and the combination of anti-LAG-3 and anti-PD-1 had a side effect profile similar to other checkpoint inhibitors. INTERPRETATION: The trial underscores the necessity of accurate response measurement in glioblastoma immune therapy. It may provide insights into patient response indicators. TRIAL DESIGN: The study was nonrandomized, with no control group. PARTICIPANTS: Eligibility included adults with recurrent glioblastoma. INTERVENTION: Anti-PD-1 and anti-LAG-3 checkpoint inhibitors were administered. OUTCOME: Primary outcome was interferon gamma level increase, measured over the treatment period. RANDOMISATION: Not applicable due to nonrandomized design. BLINDING: Not applicable. NUMBER RANDOMISED: Not applicable. NUMBER ANALYSED: All enrolled patients were analyzed. HARM: Adverse events were consistent with known profiles of checkpoint inhibitors. TRIAL REGISTRATION: [Trial registration number]. FUNDING: [Source of funding].",
