A 300-word version\n\nTitle: The EMPATHY Study: A Randomised Controlled Trial\n\nBackground: Hyperlipidemia and diabetic retinopathy are significant risk factors for cardiovascular disease (CVD). The EMPATHY study investigates whether intensive statin therapy is more effective than standard therapy in reducing cardiovascular events in patients with hyperlipidemia and diabetic retinopathy, without a history of coronary artery disease.\n\nMethods: This multicenter, randomised controlled trial was conducted between May 2010 and October 2013. Eligible patients had elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and diabetic retinopathy. Participants were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either intensive or standard statin therapy. The intensive therapy group aimed for an LDL-C target of <70 mg/dL, while the standard therapy group targeted LDL-C levels of ≥100 and <120 mg/dL. The primary outcome was a composite of CVD incidence and CVD-related death, measured over a maximum follow-up period of 5.5 years. Randomisation was computer-generated, with allocation concealment ensured. Outcome assessors were blinded to treatment allocation.\n\nResults: A total of 5,144 patients were randomised, with 2,571 assigned to intensive therapy and 2,573 to standard therapy. Baseline data were analysed for 5,107 patients (2,550 in the intensive therapy group and 2,557 in the standard therapy group) using an intention-to-treat approach. The effect size and precision of the primary outcome are detailed in the full manuscript.\n\nInterpretation: This study is the first to evaluate the benefits of intensive statin therapy in patients with hypercholesterolemia and diabetic retinopathy in a primary prevention setting. It also assesses the appropriateness of the treat-to-target approach. Adverse events were monitored, with no significant differences reported between groups. Trial registration: UMIN000003486.
