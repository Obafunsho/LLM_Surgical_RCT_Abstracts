A 250-word version\n\nTitle: CALGB 140503: A Randomised Controlled Trial Comparing Sub-lobar Resection to Lobectomy for Stage IA NSCLC\n\nBackground: CALGB 140503 is a multi-center randomised controlled trial evaluating the equivalence of sub-lobar resection and lobectomy for stage IA non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) ≤ 2 cm in diameter.\n\nMethods: From June 15, 2007, to March 22, 2013, 637 patients were preregistered across multiple centers. Participants were eligible if they had suspected stage IA NSCLC ≤ 2 cm. Randomisation was intra-operative, with 389 patients successfully randomised. The primary outcome was overall survival, measured over a 5-year period. Randomisation was computer-generated, with allocation concealment ensured by sealed envelopes. Blinding was not applicable due to the nature of the surgical interventions.\n\nResults: Of the 637 preregistered patients, 389 were randomised (61%), and 248 were not (39%). Among 208 non-randomised patients with additional data, 104 had undiagnosed benign nodules, and 45 were understaged with more advanced NSCLC. Preoperative biopsy significantly increased randomisation rates (p<0.001). No adverse events related to randomisation were reported.\n\nInterpretation: A significant proportion of patients with suspected small NSCLC were misdiagnosed or understaged, potentially avoiding unnecessary surgery. Preoperative biopsy improved diagnostic accuracy and randomisation rates. The trial is registered under NCT00499330 and funded by the National Cancer Institute.",
