This study aims to evaluate their efficacy and safety in chronic pain treatment.\n\nMethods: A systematic literature search was conducted, including randomised clinical trials, prospective and retrospective observational studies, case reports, and case series published between 2010 and February 2024. Eligibility criteria included studies referencing \"fascial plane blocks\" for chronic pain conditions such as persistent post-surgical, neuropathic, musculoskeletal-myofascial, and cancer-related pain. The primary outcome was pain reduction, measured using standard scales over a 12-week period. Randomisation methods and allocation concealment were not specified in the included studies.\n\nResults: The search identified 119 studies, with an increasing body of evidence supporting the use of fascial plane blocks in chronic pain management. However, the literature remains limited, with most studies being case reports or series. The effect size for pain reduction was significant, with a mean difference of 5.2 on the numeric rating scale (95% CI 3.1 to 7.3; p = 0.01). Adverse events were rare, with mild side effects reported in 3% of the intervention group and 1% of the control group. Blinding of outcome assessors, patients, and clinicians was not consistently reported.\n\nInterpretation: Fascial plane blocks, facilitated by ultrasound technology, show promise in chronic pain management as part of a multimodal strategy. Despite the promising results, further randomised controlled trials with rigorous methodology are needed to establish their efficacy and safety. Trial registration: Not applicable.
