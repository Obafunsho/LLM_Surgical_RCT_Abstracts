A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Mesenchymal Stem Cell Therapy for Enhancing Arteriovenous Fistula Patency\n\nBackground: Arteriovenous fistulas (AVFs) are the preferred vascular access for hemodialysis in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients, yet 40% fail within the first year. This study investigates the efficacy of mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) therapy in enhancing AVF patency.\n\nMethods: This randomised controlled trial was conducted at a tertiary care center. Participants were CKD patients eligible for AVF creation. The intervention group received MSC therapy, while the control group received standard care. The primary outcome was AVF patency at 12 months. Randomisation was computer-generated, with allocation concealment using sealed envelopes. Blinding was applied to outcome assessors, patients, and clinicians.\n\nResults: A total of 200 participants were randomised: 100 to the MSC group and 100 to the control group, between January 2020 and June 2021. Analysis included 98 in the MSC group and 97 in the control group, using an intention-to-treat approach. The MSC group demonstrated a significant improvement in AVF patency (mean difference = 15%, 95% CI 10% to 20%; p < 0.001). Adverse events were mild, with 3% in the MSC group and 1% in the control group experiencing minor side effects.\n\nInterpretation: MSC therapy significantly enhances AVF patency in CKD patients, with minimal adverse effects. These findings suggest MSC therapy as a promising alternative to current treatments for AVF failure. Further studies are warranted to confirm these results and explore long-term outcomes.\n\nTrial registration: NCT12345678\n\nFunding: This trial was funded by the National Institutes of Health.",
