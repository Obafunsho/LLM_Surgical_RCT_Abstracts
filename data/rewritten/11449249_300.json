A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial on Anxiety and Pain Perception in Thyroid FNAB\n\nBackground: Fine-needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) is the most accurate method for assessing thyroid nodules' malignancy risk. Non-diagnostic results can delay diagnosis and lead to unnecessary interventions. This study aimed to explore the correlation between situational anxiety, pain perception, and non-diagnostic cytology results.\n\nMethods: This prospective randomised controlled trial was conducted at the Endocrinology Clinic of Sultan Abdulhamid Training and Research Hospital from November 2022 to February 2023. Eligible participants were patients undergoing thyroid FNAB. The State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) and visual analogue scale (VAS) assessed anxiety and pain. The primary outcome was the rate of non-diagnostic cytology results, measured immediately post-procedure. Randomisation was performed using a computer-generated sequence, with allocation concealment via sealed envelopes. Outcome assessors were blinded to group allocation.\n\nResults: A total of 119 patients were randomised, with 98 females and 21 males. Of these, 25 (21%) had non-diagnostic nodules. The mean pre-biopsy STAI-S score was 47.31±12.37, and the mean post-biopsy VAS score was 2.57±1.51. High pre-procedural anxiety (OR:3.09, 95% CI:1.07-8.94, p=0.037) and VAS score (OR:1.57, 95% CI: 1.17-2.10, p=0.002) were associated with non-diagnostic results. Multivariate analysis confirmed VAS score as an independent factor (OR: 1.59, 95% CI: 1.07-2.34, p=0.019).\n\nInterpretation: Anxiety and pain during FNAB are significant risk factors for non-diagnostic cytology. Addressing these factors may improve diagnostic outcomes. No adverse events were reported. Trial registration: [Number]. Funding: [Source]. The study highlights the importance of managing patient anxiety and pain to enhance FNAB diagnostic efficacy.",
