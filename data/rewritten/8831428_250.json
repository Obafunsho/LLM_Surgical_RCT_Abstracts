A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial on the Impact of Cardiovascular Drugs on Myocardial Injury After Noncardiac Surgery\n\nBackground: Myocardial injury, indicated by elevated cardiac troponin (cTn) levels, is linked to increased postoperative mortality after noncardiac surgery. This study evaluates the effect of cardiovascular drugs on myocardial injury after noncardiac surgery (MINS).\n\nMethods: This randomised controlled trial was conducted at multiple international centers. Participants were adults undergoing noncardiac surgery, with eligibility based on elevated cTn levels within 30 days post-surgery. Participants were randomised to receive either cardiovascular drugs (aspirin, antihypertensives, statins) or standard care. Randomisation was computer-generated, with allocation concealed using sealed envelopes. Blinding was applied to outcome assessors.\n\nResults: A total of 200 participants were randomised: 100 to the intervention group and 100 to the control group. Analysis included 98 in the intervention group and 97 in the control group, using an intention-to-treat approach. The primary outcome was the reduction in postoperative mortality within 30 days, with a significant effect size (hazard ratio = 0.75, 95% CI 0.60 to 0.90; p = 0.01). Adverse events were mild, occurring in 3% of the intervention group and 1% of the control group.\n\nInterpretation: Cardiovascular drugs significantly reduce mortality associated with MINS. Routine monitoring of cTn levels and early intervention with cardiovascular drugs are recommended for high-risk patients.\n\nTrial registration: NCT12345678\n\nFunding: Supported by the National Institutes of Health.",
