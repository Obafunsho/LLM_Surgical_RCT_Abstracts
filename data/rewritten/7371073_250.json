Adults with clinically diagnosed lateral epicondylitis, unresponsive to nonoperative treatment, were included. Exclusion criteria were other upper-limb symptoms and prior elbow surgery. Participants were randomised (1:1:1) using computer-generated sequences, concealed from investigators, to receive PRP, autologous blood, or saline injections. The primary outcome was pain improvement on the VAS scale at 52 weeks. Secondary outcomes included DASH score and grip strength. Intention-to-treat analysis was performed.\n\nResults: A total of 119 participants were randomised: 40 to PRP, 40 to autologous blood, and 39 to saline. At 52 weeks, 31 PRP, 38 autologous blood, and 32 saline participants were analysed. No clinically important differences were found in VAS pain or DASH scores. Mean VAS pain difference was -0.2 (95% CI -1.5 to 1.1; p = 0.75) for PRP vs. saline and 0.5 (95% CI -0.7 to 1.7; p = 0.40) for autologous blood vs. saline. No adverse events were reported.\n\nInterpretation: PRP and autologous blood injections did not improve pain or function compared to saline. Further studies are needed to confirm these findings. Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov. Funded by the local hospital district.",
