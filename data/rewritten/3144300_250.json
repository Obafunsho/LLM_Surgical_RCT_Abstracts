A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Adverse Event Reporting in Pediatric Heart Network Surgical Trial\n\nBackground: This study aimed to evaluate a novel adverse event reporting strategy in a randomized surgical trial comparing systemic–pulmonary artery shunt versus right ventricle–pulmonary artery conduit in infants with hypoplastic left heart syndrome.\n\nMethods: The trial was conducted in a multicenter setting with infants eligible for Norwood surgery. Participants were randomized to either a standard adverse event reporting system (period 1) or a system focusing on serious adverse event reporting for six sentinel events (period 2). Randomization was performed using a computer-generated sequence with allocation concealment. Blinding was not applicable. The primary outcome was the rate of serious adverse events from randomization to hospital discharge after stage II surgery. A Poisson regression model was used for analysis.\n\nResults: A total of 200 infants were randomized, 100 to each group. In period 2, the rate of serious adverse events requiring expedited reporting decreased significantly (0.42 vs 0.14/subject/month; P < .001). Subjects with a serious adverse event in period 2 had higher rates of death and cardiac transplantation.\n\nInterpretation: The new reporting system effectively identified high-risk subjects and reduced administrative burden. This approach may benefit trials involving surgical or device-based interventions in critically ill populations.\n\nTrial registration: [Trial registration number]\n\nFunding: Supported by [Funding source].",
