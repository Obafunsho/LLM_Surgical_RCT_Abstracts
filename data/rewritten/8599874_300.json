A 300-word version\n\nTitle: A Randomised Controlled Trial Comparing Distal and Standard Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass in Patients with BMI 50–60 kg/m²\n\nBackground: The optimal surgical procedure for weight loss in patients with a BMI of 50 kg/m² or more is uncertain. This study compared distal Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) with standard RYGB.\n\nMethods: In this double-blind, parallel-group RCT, 123 patients aged 20–60 years with a BMI of 50–60 kg/m² were randomised to receive either standard RYGB (150 cm alimentary limb) or distal RYGB (150 cm common channel) between May 2011 and April 2013 at two public tertiary-care institutions in Norway. Randomisation was performed using permuted-block randomization with allocation concealment. Patients, outcome assessors, and the statistician were blinded. The primary outcome was change in BMI at 2 years. Secondary outcomes at 5 years included weight loss, health-related quality of life, and nutritional outcomes.\n\nResults: Of 113 patients who received an intervention, 92 attended the 5-year follow-up. BMI reduction was 15.1 kg/m² (95% CI 13.9 to 16.2) for standard RYGB and 15.7 kg/m² (14.5 to 16.9) for distal RYGB, with a between-group difference of -0.64 kg/m² (P = 0.447). Total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and haemoglobin A1c levels declined more after distal RYGB. Adverse events included repeat abdominal surgery in 28% of standard and 18% of distal RYGB patients. Vitamin A and D levels were lower after distal RYGB.\n\nInterpretation: Distal RYGB did not result in greater weight loss than standard RYGB. Differences in other outcomes favoring distal RYGB, such as improved lipid profiles, may not justify its routine use due to potential nutritional deficiencies. Trial registration: NCT00821197.
