A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Tailoring Biliopancreatic Limb Length in One Anastomosis Gastric Bypass: A Randomised Controlled Trial\n\nBackground: This double-blind, single-centre randomised controlled trial (RCT) aimed to evaluate whether tailoring the biliopancreatic (BP) limb length based on total small bowel length (TSBL) results in superior outcomes compared to a fixed 150 cm BP limb in one anastomosis gastric bypass (OAGB).\n\nMethods: Conducted in a non-academic teaching hospital in the Netherlands, eligible patients aged 18-65 years, meeting IFSO criteria for metabolic bariatric surgery, were randomised intraoperatively. The intervention group received a tailored BP limb based on TSBL, while the control group received a standard 150 cm BP limb. The primary outcome was percentage total weight loss (%TWL) at 5 years, with a predefined 1-year analysis. Randomisation used a sealed envelope method with allocation concealment. Patients, research team, and care providers were blinded.\n\nResults: Between September 2020 and August 2022, 212 patients were randomised: 105 to the standard group and 107 to the tailored group. The mean TSBL was 657 cm. In the tailored group, BP limb lengths of 150, 180, and 210 cm were applied to 8.4%, 53.3%, and 38.3% of patients, respectively. At 1 year, the mean %TWL was 32.8% in the standard group and 33.1% in the tailored group (P = 0.787). No significant differences in nutritional deficiencies or short-term complications were observed. Adverse events were mild and occurred in 3% of the intervention group and 1% of the control group.\n\nInterpretation: Tailoring BP limb length based on TSBL is safe and feasible but not superior to a standard 150 cm BP limb in terms of %TWL at 1 year.
