A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Prophylactic Intraperitoneal Mesh Implantation in Abdominal Surgery: A Randomised Controlled Trial\n\nBackground: Incisional hernia is a frequent complication following open abdominal surgery. Prophylactic mesh implantation may reduce hernia incidence but could lead to wound-associated complications.\n\nMethods: This open-label randomised controlled trial was conducted at Bern University Hospital, Switzerland, from January 1, 2011, to February 29, 2014. Participants with two or more risk factors (overweight/obesity, neoplastic disease, male sex, previous laparotomy) were included. Patients were randomised to receive either intraperitoneal mesh implantation or standard abdominal closure. The primary outcome was the incidence of incisional hernia at 3 years. Randomisation was performed using a computer-generated sequence, with allocation concealment by sealed envelopes. Blinding was not applied.\n\nResults: Of 169 patients, 150 were analysed (69 mesh, 81 control). The cumulative incidence of incisional hernia was significantly lower in the mesh group (7.2% vs 18.5%, P = .03). Abdominal pain was more frequent in the mesh group at 6 weeks (65% vs 44%, P = .04) but not at 12 and 36 months. No difference in surgical site infections was observed, but wound healing was longer in the mesh group (8 vs 5 weeks, P = .03). Trunk extension was reduced in the mesh group (1.73 cm vs 2.40 cm, P = .009).\n\nInterpretation: Prophylactic intraperitoneal mesh implantation reduces the incidence of incisional hernia in high-risk patients but is associated with increased early postoperative pain and prolonged wound healing.
