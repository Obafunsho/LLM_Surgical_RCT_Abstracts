A 300-word version\n\nTitle: A Randomised Controlled Trial Comparing HF10 Therapy and Traditional SCS for Chronic Pain\n\nBackground: This study assesses the long-term efficacy of 10-kHz high-frequency (HF10) spinal cord stimulation (SCS) compared to traditional low-frequency SCS in managing chronic back and leg pain.\n\nMethods: A prospective, randomised controlled trial was conducted at 11 US pain treatment centers. Participants with chronic intractable pain (VAS ≥5.0/10.0 cm) were randomised 1:1 to receive HF10 therapy or traditional SCS. The primary outcome was the responder rate, defined as ≥50% reduction in back pain at 3 months. Randomisation was stratified by sex and primary pain area, with allocation concealment via centrally administered blocks. Blinding was not feasible due to therapy differences. \n\nResults: From June to December 2012, 198 participants were randomised (101 HF10, 97 traditional SCS). At 24 months, 76.5% of HF10 and 49.3% of traditional SCS participants were responders for back pain (27.2% difference, 95% CI, 10.1%-41.8%; P < .001). For leg pain, 72.9% of HF10 and 49.3% of traditional SCS participants were responders (23.6% difference, 95% CI, 5.9%-38.6%; P < .001). HF10 therapy showed greater reductions in back pain (66.9% ± 31.8%) compared to traditional SCS (41.1% ± 36.8%, P < .001). Adverse events were similar between groups, with no stimulation-related serious adverse events or neurological deficits reported.\n\nInterpretation: HF10 therapy demonstrates long-term superiority over traditional SCS in treating chronic back and leg pain, with significant improvements in pain reduction and patient satisfaction.\n\nTrial registration: NCT01609972\n\nFunding: Supported by Nevro Corp.",
