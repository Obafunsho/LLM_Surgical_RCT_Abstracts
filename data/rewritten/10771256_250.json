The primary outcome was the frequency of cellulitis over 6 months. Secondary outcomes included assessments of limb circumference, hardness, and pain. Randomisation was conducted using a blocked random assignment with allocation concealment managed by the Clinical Trial Office. Blinding was not possible due to the nature of the interventions.\n\nResults: A total of 336 patients were randomised: 105 to the LVA group and 120 to the control group, between January 2017 and September 2019. In the full-analysis set, LVA with decongestive therapy significantly reduced cellulitis frequency compared to decongestive therapy alone (mean difference = −0.35, 95% CI −0.62 to −0.09; p = 0.010). In the per-protocol set, the difference was −0.60 (95% CI −0.94 to −0.27; p = 0.001). Limb circumference and pain did not differ significantly, but LVA reduced thigh area hardness. Four patients in the control group experienced contact dermatitis.\n\nInterpretation: LVA combined with decongestive therapy is more effective than decongestive therapy alone in preventing cellulitis in patients with lower extremity lymphoedema.\n\nTrial registration: UMIN00025137, UMIN00031462.\n\nFunding: Not specified.",
