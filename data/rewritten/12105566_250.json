This study aimed to assess the accuracy of surgical ward round documentation.\n\nMethods: This prospective observational cohort study was conducted in the General Surgical Units of two hospitals over 24 months. Eligible participants included adults admitted to surgical wards who could consent and comprehend English. A total of 135 audio-visual recordings of ward rounds were reviewed. Discussion points were stratified as Major, Minor, or Not Significant by an external reviewer. The primary outcome was the accuracy of Major discussion documentation. Secondary objectives included identifying factors affecting accuracy, such as patient age, sex, length of stay, and clinician.\n\nResults: Of the 135 encounters, 32.4% of Major discussion points were omitted from case notes, and 11% contained significant errors. Patient age (P = 0.04), day of the week (P = 0.05), and the scribing intern (P ≤ 0.001) significantly impacted documentation accuracy. Intern documentation accuracy varied widely (35.5%–88.9%).\n\nInterpretation: A significant portion of critical ward round discussions is not documented, indicating a need for system-wide changes to improve patient safety and outcomes. No adverse events were reported. The study was funded by the Avant Foundation Grant. Trial registration: Central Adelaide Local Health Network Human Research Ethics Committee (#12993).",
