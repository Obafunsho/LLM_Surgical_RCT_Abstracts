A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of a Question Prompt List Intervention for Older Patients Considering Major Surgery\n\nBackground: Poor preoperative communication can lead to unwanted treatment and postoperative conflict. This study aimed to compare the effectiveness of a question prompt list (QPL) intervention versus usual care on patient engagement and well-being among older patients considering major surgery.\n\nMethods: This randomised clinical trial used a stepped-wedge design, with patients randomly assigned to a QPL intervention (n=223) or usual care (n=223) based on the timing of their visit with one of 40 surgeons at five US study sites. Participants were 60 years or older with at least one comorbidity and an oncologic or vascular problem treatable with major surgery. The intervention included a brochure of 11 questions and an endorsement letter from the surgeon. Primary outcomes were the number and type of questions asked during the surgical visit and patient-reported Perceived Efficacy in Patient-Physician Interactions scale. Randomisation was by intent-to-treat, and outcome assessors were blinded.\n\nResults: Of 1319 eligible patients, 446 were randomised. The mean age was 71.8 years, and 55.8% were male. No significant differences were found between groups for primary outcomes. The difference in MYCaW scores for family members was greater in usual care (effect estimate, 1.51; 95% CI, 0.28-2.74; P=.008). No adverse events were reported.\n\nInterpretation: The QPL intervention did not significantly improve patient engagement or well-being. Addressing clinician communication may be necessary for effective change.\n\nTrial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02623335\n\nFunding: Not specified.",
