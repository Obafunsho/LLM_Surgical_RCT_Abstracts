Participants were randomised 1:1 to perioperative systemic therapy or CRS–HIPEC alone, with stratification by previous systemic therapy, onset of peritoneal metastases, peritoneal cancer index, and planned HIPEC regimen. PROs were assessed using EORTC QLQ-C30, QLQ-CR29, and EQ-5D-5L questionnaires at baseline, after neoadjuvant treatment, and at 3 and 6 months postoperatively. Linear mixed modeling was employed for analysis.\n\nResults: From June 2017 to January 2019, 80 patients were randomised, with 40 in each group. In the modified intention-to-treat analysis, 37 patients received perioperative systemic therapy and 42 underwent upfront surgery. All predefined PROs were comparable between arms at all timepoints and returned to baseline at 3 or 6 months postoperatively. The experimental arm experienced worsening of fatigue (MD +14, p = 0.001), loss of appetite (MD +15, p = 0.003), hair loss (MD +18, p < 0.001), and loss of taste (MD +27, p < 0.001) after neoadjuvant treatment, with most returning to baseline postoperatively. No significant adverse events were reported.\n\nInterpretation: PROs were comparable between treatment arms, indicating acceptable tolerability of perioperative systemic therapy. These findings, along with previously reported feasibility and safety data, support the justification for a phase III trial. Trial registration: NCT02758951. Funding: Not specified.",
