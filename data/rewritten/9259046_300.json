A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of a Digital Behavioral Pain Management Intervention in Orthopedic Trauma Surgery\n\nBackground: This study aimed to assess the feasibility and efficacy of a digital behavioral pain management intervention, \"My Surgical Success\" (MSS), compared to a digital general health education (HE) intervention in orthopedic trauma surgery patients.\n\nMethods: A randomised controlled trial was conducted at an academic hospital in the San Francisco Bay area. Participants were adults aged 18-80 undergoing orthopedic trauma surgery. They were randomly assigned to MSS or HE using the REDCap system with a 1:1 ratio. Outcome assessors were blinded. The primary outcome was feasibility, assessed by treatment acceptability and engagement rate, measured up to 3 months post-surgery. Secondary outcomes included pain intensity, pain catastrophizing, and time to opioid cessation.\n\nResults: A total of 84 participants were randomised (MSS, n = 37; HE, n = 47) between December 2018 and January 2020. The engagement rate was 63%, with >80% of MSS participants reporting treatment acceptability. MSS participants showed greater reductions in pain intensity over time (F[215] = 5.23; P = .024). No significant differences were observed for opioid cessation or pain catastrophizing (F[215] = 0.20; P = .653). The study sample had subclinical baseline pain catastrophizing scores (M = 14.10; 95% CI, 11.70–16.49). No adverse events were reported.\n\nInterpretation: MSS is a feasible and effective intervention for reducing postsurgical pain in motivated orthopedic trauma surgery patients. However, it did not significantly impact opioid cessation compared to HE. The study highlights the potential of digital interventions in postoperative pain management.
