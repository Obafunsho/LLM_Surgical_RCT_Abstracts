A 250-word version\n\nTitle: A Randomised Controlled Trial of Antimicrobial Sutures in Hand Trauma Surgery\n\nBackground: Surgical site infection (SSI) is a significant concern in hand trauma surgery. This study aimed to evaluate the feasibility of a definitive trial comparing antimicrobial sutures to standard sutures in reducing SSI.\n\nMethods: This multicentre feasibility randomised controlled trial was conducted at three NHS hospitals in the UK. Participants were adults with hand or wrist injuries requiring surgery. The intervention group received antimicrobial sutures, while the control group received standard sutures. The primary outcome was feasibility, measured by recruitment, compliance, and retention over 6 months. Randomisation was 1:1, stratified by age and injury type, using a secure online service. Participants were blinded to allocation.\n\nResults: From March to November 2022, 116 participants were randomised (60 intervention, 56 control). Of 227 screened, 89.5% were eligible, and 84.7% consented. Retention was 57.5% at 30 days, 52% at 90 days, and 45.1% at 6 months. SSI incidence was over 20% in both groups. Hand function initially deteriorated but improved over time. No adverse events related to treatment allocation were reported.\n\nInterpretation: The high SSI risk in hand trauma surgery underscores the need for effective interventions. A definitive trial of antimicrobial sutures is feasible if retention improves. \n\nTrial registration: ISRCTN10771059\n\nFunding: The study was supported by the UK Trauma Patient and Public Involvement Group.",
