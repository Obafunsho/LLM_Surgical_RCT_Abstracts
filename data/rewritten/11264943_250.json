Participants were randomly assigned to receive either LOGAB with 5 ml of 0.5% ropivacaine (n=31) or normal saline (n=31). The primary outcome was the numeric rating scale (NRS) scores at rest and motion within 48 hours post-surgery. Randomisation was computer-generated, and allocation was concealed in sealed envelopes. Blinding included patients, outcome assessors, and clinicians.\n\nResults: A total of 59 patients were analysed (30 in LOGAB group, 29 in control group) using an intention-to-treat approach. NRS scores at rest were significantly lower in the LOGAB group compared to control (mean difference = 1.4, 95% CI 0.9 to 1.9; p=0.002). Intraoperative opioid consumption was reduced in the LOGAB group (p<0.01). No adverse events were reported.\n\nInterpretation: LOGAB is a promising analgesic strategy for vestibular schwannoma craniotomy, reducing pain and opioid use without adverse events.\n\nTrial registration: ChiCTR2000038798.\n\nFunding: Not specified.",
