A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Percutaneous Sciatic Nerve Peripheral Nerve Stimulation for Postoperative Analgesia in Ambulatory Foot Surgery\n\nBackground: This study aimed to evaluate the feasibility and analgesic efficacy of percutaneous sciatic nerve peripheral nerve stimulation (PNS) in ambulatory foot surgery.\n\nMethods: This randomised, double-masked, crossover trial was conducted at the University of California San Diego. Adults scheduled for primary, unilateral hallux valgus osteotomy were eligible, excluding those with certain medical conditions or treatments. Seven participants were randomised to receive either 5 minutes of PNS or sham stimulation, followed by a 5-minute crossover period. The primary outcome was pain reduction, measured using the numeric rating scale (NRS) over 40 minutes postoperatively. Randomisation was computer-generated, with allocation concealed in opaque envelopes. Blinding included patients, clinicians, and outcome assessors.\n\nResults: Four participants initially received PNS, showing a downward pain trend, while three receiving sham reported no change until crossover. Pain scores decreased to 52% of baseline during subsequent 30 minutes of stimulation. Three participants used a continuous popliteal nerve block for rescue analgesia. Adverse events included one lead dislodgement and three lead fractures.\n\nInterpretation: Percutaneous sciatic nerve PNS is feasible and suggests analgesic benefits in ambulatory foot surgery, though lead dislodgement and fracture are concerns. Further trials are warranted.\n\nTrial registration: Clinicaltrials.gov NCT02898103.\n\nFunding: Not specified.",
