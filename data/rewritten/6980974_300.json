A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Carotid Revascularization and Medical Management for Asymptomatic Carotid Stenosis Trial (CREST-2): A Randomised Controlled Trial\n\nBackground: The CREST-2 trial investigates the efficacy of carotid revascularization combined with intensive medical management (IMM) in patients with asymptomatic high-grade atherosclerotic stenosis. This analysis details the credentialing process for carotid artery stenting (CAS) interventionists.\n\nMethods: CREST-2 consists of two randomised trials. Interventionists were credentialed based on a review of their last 25 consecutive CAS cases and self-reported lifetime experience. Additional cases were required for those needing further training. The Interventional Management Committee (IMC) reviewed cases from March 21, 2014, to October 14, 2017. The trial was conducted across multiple centers, with randomisation and allocation concealment methods not specified.\n\nResults: A total of 334 interventionists submitted 8311 cases. Initial approval was granted to 9% (30/334) of interventionists, increasing to 46% (153/334) after additional training. The median lifetime case experience for approved interventionists was 211.5. The case rate was significantly associated with initial approval (P < .00001). No adverse events were reported during the credentialing process.\n\nInterpretation: The credentialing process effectively identified skilled interventionists for CREST-2, highlighting the importance of recent high-volume experience. Approval was not influenced by operator specialty. The trial registration number and funding source were not provided in the manuscript.",
