A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of ϵ-Aminocaproic Acid Pharmacokinetics in Adolescents Undergoing Spinal Fusion\n\nBackground: Despite the efficacy of ϵ-aminocaproic acid (EACA) in reducing blood loss during spinal fusion in adolescents, population-specific pharmacokinetic data are lacking. This study aimed to determine EACA pharmacokinetics and recommend dosing in this population.\n\nMethods: This randomised controlled trial enrolled 20 adolescents aged 12–17 years undergoing spinal fusion at a tertiary care center. Participants were randomised into two groups based on scoliosis diagnosis: idiopathic (n=10) and non-idiopathic (n=10). A population non-linear mixed effects modelling approach was used, incorporating data from infants undergoing craniofacial surgery to extend recommendations across weights and ages. The primary outcome was pharmacokinetic parameter estimation over the surgical period.\n\nResults: A two-compartment model with allometrically scaled weight and age effect on clearance was used. Parameters for a typical patient included plasma clearance of 153 ml min−1 70 kg−1, intercompartmental clearance of 200 ml min−1 70 kg−1, central volume of distribution of 8.78 litre 70 kg−1, and peripheral volume of distribution of 15.8 litre 70 kg−1. Scoliosis aetiology did not significantly affect pharmacokinetics. No adverse events were reported.\n\nInterpretation: Recommended dosing schemes are: <25 kg, 100 mg kg−1 loading dose and 40 mg kg−1 h−1 infusion; 25–<50 kg, 100 mg kg−1 loading dose and 35 mg kg−1 h−1 infusion; ≥50 kg, 100 mg kg−1 loading dose and 30 mg kg−1 h−1 infusion. An efficacy trial is warranted. Trial registration: NCT01408823. Funding: Not specified.",
