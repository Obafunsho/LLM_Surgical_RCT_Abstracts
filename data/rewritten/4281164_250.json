A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Single-Dose vs. Divided-Dose rATG Induction in Renal Transplantation\n\nBackground: This randomised, unblinded 2×2 factorial trial evaluated the long-term safety and efficacy of single-dose (SD) versus divided-dose (DD) rabbit antithymocyte globulin (rATG) induction in renal transplant recipients.\n\nMethods: Conducted at a single center, 180 adult renal transplant recipients were randomised to receive either SD-rATG (6 mg/kg over 24 hours) or DD-rATG (four 1.5 mg/kg doses on alternate days). The primary outcome was renal function, measured by the abbreviated modification of diet in renal disease formula, over a follow-up period averaging 51.8 months. Secondary outcomes included patient survival, graft survival, and complications. Randomisation was computer-generated, and allocation was not concealed. The study was unblinded.\n\nResults: 90 participants were randomised to each group. SD-rATG was associated with improved renal function in deceased donor recipients (P <0.001) and faster recovery of lymphocyte subsets. Cox multivariate analysis indicated that DD-rATG, deceased donor status, serious infection, and lower lymphocyte count were associated with increased mortality. Adverse events were more frequent in the DD group, with higher infection rates.\n\nInterpretation: SD-rATG induction improves renal function and reduces infection rates in deceased donor kidney recipients, suggesting administration method impacts efficacy and safety.
