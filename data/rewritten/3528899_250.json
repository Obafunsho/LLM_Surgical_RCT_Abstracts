This study compares tissue concentrations of cefazolin achieved via systemic versus regional intraosseous administration.\n\nMethods: This randomised controlled trial included 22 patients undergoing primary TKA, conducted at a single orthopedic center. Participants were randomly assigned to two groups: Group 1 (n=11) received 1 g cefazolin systemically 10 minutes before tourniquet inflation, while Group 2 (n=11) received 1 g cefazolin intraosseously in 200 mL of normal saline through a tibial cannula after tourniquet inflation and before skin incision. Subcutaneous fat and femoral bone samples were collected at set intervals, and antibiotic concentrations were measured using high-performance liquid chromatography. Randomisation was computer-generated, and allocation was concealed using sealed envelopes. Blinding was not specified.\n\nResults: The mean tissue concentration of cefazolin in subcutaneous fat was 186 ug/g in the intraosseous group and 11 ug/g in the systemic group. In bone, the mean concentration was 130 ug/g in the intraosseous group and 11 ug/g in the systemic group. No adverse events were reported.\n\nInterpretation: Intraosseous administration achieves significantly higher tissue concentrations of cefazolin compared to systemic administration. Further research is needed to assess its efficacy in infection prevention. Trial registration and funding details were not provided.",
