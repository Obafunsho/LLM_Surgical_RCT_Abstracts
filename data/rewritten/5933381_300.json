A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Perioperative Gabapentin for Postoperative Pain and Opioid Cessation\n\nBackground: Despite guidelines recommending gabapentin to reduce postoperative pain and opioid use, clinical practice shows significant variation.\n\nMethods: This randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was conducted at a single-center, tertiary referral teaching hospital. A total of 1805 patients aged 18 to 75 years scheduled for surgeries such as thoracotomy, total hip replacement, and mastectomy were screened. Participants were enrolled from May 25, 2010, to July 25, 2014, and followed for 2 years. Randomisation was computer-generated, and allocation was concealed. Patients, clinicians, and outcome assessors were blinded. Gabapentin (1200 mg preoperatively and 600 mg three times daily postoperatively) was compared to an active placebo (lorazepam, 0.5 mg preoperatively followed by inactive placebo postoperatively for 72 hours). The primary outcome was time to pain resolution, defined as five consecutive reports of zero pain at the surgical site. Secondary outcomes included time to opioid cessation and the proportion of participants with continued pain or opioid use at 6 months and 1 year.\n\nResults: Of 1805 patients screened, 1383 were excluded, and 422 were randomised: 202 to placebo and 208 to gabapentin. Intention-to-treat analysis showed no effect on pain cessation (HR, 1.04; 95% CI, 0.82-1.33; P = .73) but a 24% increase in opioid cessation rate (HR, 1.24; 95% CI, 1.00-1.54; P = .05). Adverse events were similar between groups, with sedation or dizziness leading to medication discontinuation in 20.8% of placebo and 25.0% of gabapentin patients.\n\nInterpretation: Perioperative gabapentin did not affect pain resolution but modestly promoted opioid cessation. Further research on optimal dosing and timing is needed to enhance its efficacy in reducing opioid use.\n\nTrial Registration: NCT01067144\n\nFunding: Not specified.",
