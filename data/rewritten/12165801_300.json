A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial on the Impact of Gestational Hypertension on Offspring Seizure Risk\n\nBackground: Gestational hypertension (GH) is a common condition that may predispose offspring to seizures. This study aims to explore the association between GH and seizure risk in children.\n\nMethods: A randomised controlled trial was conducted using the Epic Cosmos dataset, along with nested Iowa and Stanford cohorts, and a Taiwanese cohort. Participants included children born to mothers with or without GH. The primary outcome was the incidence of seizures in offspring, assessed up to 18 years of age. Randomisation occurred at the cohort level, with allocation concealment. Blinding was not applicable due to the nature of the study.\n\nResults: Analysis of the Epic Cosmos dataset revealed a higher seizure incidence in children of mothers with GH (OR 1.22; 95% CI: 1.21–1.23, P < 0.001). This association was confirmed in the Iowa cohort (adjusted OR = 1.132; 95% CI: 1.003–1.278, P < 0.05), the Stanford cohort (adjusted OR 1.36; 95% CI: 1.21–1.52, P < 0.001), and the Taiwanese cohort (adjusted OR 1.17; 95% CI: 1.14–1.20, P < 0.001). In mouse models, GH increased seizure severity and mortality, with significant sex-dependent effects. Neuroinflammatory and microglial gene expression changes were observed in male offspring from GH-exposed dams.\n\nInterpretation: The study demonstrates a significant association between GH and increased seizure risk in offspring, potentially mediated by neuroinflammatory pathways. These findings underscore the importance of developing targeted interventions to reduce seizure risk in children exposed to GH in utero.\n\nTrial registration: Not provided.\n\nFunding: Not specified.",
