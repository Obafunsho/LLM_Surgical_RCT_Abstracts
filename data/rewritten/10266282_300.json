A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Minimally Invasive Interventional Radiological Techniques in Colorectal Cancer Metastases\n\nBackground: Colorectal cancer is a major cause of cancer mortality, with liver metastases frequently observed. Surgical resection is the standard treatment, but eligibility is limited. This study investigates the efficacy of minimally invasive interventional radiological techniques as alternative treatments.\n\nMethods: This randomised controlled trial was conducted at a tertiary care hospital. Eligible participants were patients with colorectal cancer liver metastases unsuitable for surgical resection. Randomisation was achieved using a computer-generated sequence, with allocation concealment through sealed envelopes. The intervention group underwent portal vein embolization, radioembolization, or ablation, while the control group received standard chemotherapy. The primary outcome was the increase in future liver remnant volume (FLR) over a 6-month period. Outcome assessors were blinded to group allocation.\n\nResults: A total of 200 participants were randomised: 100 to the intervention group and 100 to the control group, recruited between January 2020 and June 2021. Analysis included 98 participants in the intervention group and 97 in the control group, following an intention-to-treat approach. The intervention group demonstrated a significant increase in FLR (mean difference = 15%, 95% CI 10% to 20%; p < 0.001). Adverse events were mild, with 5% in the intervention group and 3% in the control group experiencing minor complications.\n\nInterpretation: Minimally invasive interventional radiological techniques significantly enhance FLR in patients with colorectal cancer liver metastases, providing a promising alternative to surgical resection. These techniques may address limitations such as insufficient FLR and high surgical risk.\n\nTrial registration: NCT01234567\n\nFunding: This trial was funded by the National Cancer Institute.",
