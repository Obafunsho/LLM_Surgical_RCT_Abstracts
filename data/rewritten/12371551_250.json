  "abstract": "1. A 250-word version\n\nBackground: Traumatic carotid-jugular fistulas (CJFs) are rare vascular injuries that can lead to severe complications if untreated. This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of open surgical repair for complex CJFs in resource-limited settings.\n\nMethods: This case report describes a 23-year-old Afghan man with a traumatic CJF and right common carotid pseudoaneurysm following a gunshot wound. The patient presented with persistent neck pain and pulsation. Imaging revealed an aneurysmal dilation and fistulous connection. The intervention involved open surgical repair, including resection of the aneurysm and reconstruction of the affected vessels.\n\nResults: Postoperative recovery was marked by the resolution of symptoms and normal function. The patient was discharged two days after surgery with improved signs and symptoms. No adverse events were reported during the follow-up period.\n\nInterpretation: This case underscores the effectiveness of open surgery for complex CJFs, particularly in settings where endovascular interventions may not be feasible due to resource constraints. The successful management of this case highlights the importance of tailoring treatment strategies to local resource availability and patient-specific factors. The study emphasizes the viability of open surgical intervention in resource-limited settings, providing a cost-effective and definitive solution for traumatic CJFs.",
