Patients scheduled for open liver resection were randomised to receive either 10 mg/kg methylprednisolone (high dose) or 8 mg dexamethasone (standard dose). The primary outcome was the number of patients with complications in the postanaesthesia care unit (PACU), measured during the PACU stay. Secondary outcomes included duration of hospital stay, pain and nausea during admission, and 30-day morbidity. Randomisation was performed using block randomisation with allocation concealment via sealed opaque envelopes. All participants, trial personnel, and outcome assessors were blinded.\n\nResults: A total of 174 patients were randomised (88 to high-dose, 86 to standard-dose) and analysed using an intention-to-treat approach. The mean age was 65 years, and 67.2% were men. Complications occurred in 51 patients (58%) in the high-dose group and 58 (67%) in the standard-dose group (risk ratio 0.86, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.08; P = 0.213). Median hospital stay was 4 days in both groups (P = 0.160). Thirty-day morbidity and mortality rates were similar. Adverse events occurred in 48 patients (45%) in the high-dose group and 49 (43%) in the standard-dose group, with no serious adverse reactions reported.\n\nInterpretation: A high dose of preoperative glucocorticoids did not reduce acute postoperative complications after open liver resection compared with a standard dose.\n\nTrial registration: NCT03403517; EudraCT 2017–002652-81.\n\nFunding: Supported by the Research Fund at Rigshospitalet and Departments of Anaesthesiology and Gastrointestinal Surgery and Transplantation, Centre for Cancer and Organ Diseases, Rigshospitalet Copenhagen University Hospital, Denmark.",
