A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Intrastriatal Carotid Body Autotransplantation in Advanced Parkinson's Disease\n\nBackground: Carotid body (CB) glomus cells are dopaminergic and express neurotrophic factors. This study evaluates the feasibility, safety, and effects of intrastriatal CB autotransplantation in advanced Parkinson's disease (PD).\n\nMethods: This phase I–II trial involved 13 patients with advanced PD, who underwent bilateral stereotactic implantation of CB cell aggregates into the striatum. Participants were assessed pre-surgery and up to 3 years post-surgery using CAPIT and CAPSIT-PD protocols. The primary outcome was the change in video-blinded Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale III score in the off-medication state. Seven patients underwent 18 F-dopa PET scans pre-surgery and 1 year post-transplantation.\n\nResults: Of 12 patients analyzed, 10 showed clinical improvement in the primary outcome, peaking at 6–12 months post-transplantation (5–74% improvement). Mean improvement at 6 months was 23%. At 3 years, 3 of 6 patients maintained improvement (15–48%). No off-period dyskinesias were reported. Predictive factors for motor improvement included CB histological integrity and milder disease severity. A non-significant 5% increase in mean putaminal 18 F-dopa uptake was observed, with an inverse relationship between clinical improvement and annual decline in uptake (r = -0.829; p = 0.042).\n\nInterpretation: CB autotransplantation may offer clinical benefits in advanced PD, linked to the biological properties of implanted glomus cells. No adverse events were reported. Trial registration: [Number]. Funding: [Source].",
