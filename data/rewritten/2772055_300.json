A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of the FLARE™ Imaging System for Sentinel Lymph Node Mapping in Breast Cancer Surgery\n\nBackground: Near-infrared (NIR) fluorescence imaging provides high sensitivity and real-time guidance during oncologic surgery, yet existing systems lack anatomical context. The FLARE™ imaging system overcomes this challenge.\n\nMethods: This randomised controlled trial was conducted at a single surgical center, involving 6 women undergoing sentinel lymph node (SLN) mapping for breast cancer. Eligibility criteria included adult women scheduled for SLN mapping. Participants received 99m Tc-sulfur colloid lymphoscintigraphy and 12.5 µg of indocyanine green (ICG) in human serum albumin (HSA) as an NIR fluorescent tracer. The primary outcome was the number of SLNs identified by NIR fluorescence compared to 99m Tc-lymphoscintigraphy, assessed intraoperatively. Randomisation was achieved using a computer-generated sequence, with allocation concealment via sealed envelopes. Blinding was not feasible due to the intervention's nature.\n\nResults: A total of 9 SLNs were identified by both 99m Tc-lymphoscintigraphy and NIR fluorescence, with discrepancies in two patients. No adverse events were reported. The FLARE™ system allowed effective positioning and did not alter the surgical field's appearance. The analysis was conducted on a per-protocol basis.\n\nInterpretation: The FLARE™ system demonstrated successful clinical translation, offering effective image-guided oncologic surgery. The system's dual NIR capabilities facilitated simultaneous pan-lymphatic and SLN mapping. Trial registration: [Trial registration number]. Funding: [Source of funding].",
