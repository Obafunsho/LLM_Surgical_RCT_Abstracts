Adjuvant drugs that enhance cell survival during tissue hypoxia could improve outcomes. This study evaluates six potential treatments for hemorrhagic shock (HS): niacin, thiazolidinediones, prolyl hydroxylase domain inhibitors, O-GlcNAcylation stimulation, histone deacetylase inhibitors, and adenosine–lidocaine–magnesium solution.\n\nMethods: A systematic review was conducted using PubMed and ClinicalTrials.gov databases, focusing on studies from 2000 onwards. Articles on medical devices, transfusion therapy, steroid treatment, and specific coagulation or inflammation targets were excluded. The review assessed the biological mechanisms and preclinical efficacy of these treatments in HS.\n\nResults: The selected treatments demonstrated potential in enhancing mitochondrial function, reducing inflammation, and improving cell survival during tissue hypoxia in preclinical models. Niacin and thiazolidinediones showed improved survival in animal models, while prolyl hydroxylase domain inhibitors and O-GlcNAcylation stimulation demonstrated promising effects on cellular stress responses. Histone deacetylase inhibitors and adenosine–lidocaine–magnesium solution showed potential in improving cardiac function and reducing blood failure. These findings suggest that the treatments could serve as effective adjuvant therapies during the initial resuscitation of severe trauma patients, including in out-of-hospital settings.\n\nInterpretation: The promising results of these molecules, some already approved for other indications, warrant further investigation in human clinical trials for HS. The study underscores the need for adjuvant therapies to improve outcomes in severe trauma patients. However, translating findings from animal models to human trials remains challenging, and further research is needed to confirm efficacy and safety in clinical settings. The potential for these treatments to enhance survival in HS highlights their importance in future clinical research.",
