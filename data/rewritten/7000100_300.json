A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Tissue Adhesive in Bilateral Total Knee Arthroplasty\n\nBackground: Prolonged wound drainage after total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is linked to increased infection risk. This study investigates the impact of high-viscosity tissue adhesive on postoperative wound drainage and healing in a fast-track TKA setting.\n\nMethods: In this randomised controlled trial, 30 patients undergoing simultaneous bilateral TKA were included. The left knee was randomised to receive either standard three-layer closure with staples or the same closure supplemented with tissue adhesive, with the opposite treatment on the contralateral knee. One patient was excluded, leaving 29 patients (58 knees) for analysis. The primary outcome was the number of dressing changes in the first 72 hours postoperatively. The secondary outcome was wound healing assessed by the ASEPSIS score at 3 weeks. Nurses changing dressings were blinded to treatment allocation.\n\nResults: Knees with tissue adhesive had fewer dressing changes (median, 0; IQR, 0-1) compared to the control (IQR, 1-2; p = 0.001). In the intervention group, 59% of knees required no dressing changes before discharge, compared to 24% in the control group (p = 0.02). ASEPSIS scores at 3 weeks showed no significant difference between groups.\n\nInterpretation: Tissue adhesive as an adjunct to standard wound closure in TKA reduced the number of dressing changes but did not alter wound healing at 3 weeks. Further studies are needed to evaluate cost-effectiveness and long-term outcomes. No adverse events were reported. Trial registration and funding details are not provided. The study highlights the potential benefits of tissue adhesive in reducing immediate postoperative care requirements, though its broader implications remain to be explored.",
