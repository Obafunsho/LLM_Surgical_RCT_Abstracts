A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Biomechanical Analysis of Short-Stem Total Hip Arthroplasty in Revision Scenarios: A Randomised Controlled Trial\n\nBackground: Short-stem total hip arthroplasty (SHA) is gaining popularity for its bone-preserving benefits. This study evaluates whether a short stem can provide adequate primary stability in revision total hip arthroplasty (THA) scenarios.\n\nMethods: This randomised controlled trial involved ten composite femurs, with randomisation at the femur level. A metaphyseal anchoring SHA (Tri-Lock BPS) stem and a standard THA (Corail) stem were implanted and dynamically loaded from 300 to 1700 N at 1 Hz. Primary stability was assessed using three-dimensional (3D) micromotions at five points around the bone–implant interface. A revision scenario was created by replacing the standard stem with the Tri-Lock BPS stem. Blinding was not applicable.\n\nResults: In the primary scenario, no significant differences in 3D micromotions were observed between the short and standard stems at most test points, except at the lateral point of the distal femur (P5: Tri-Lock BPS 32.9 ± 7.54 μm vs. Corail 25.1 ± 4.32 μm; p = 0.011). In the revision scenario, no significant differences in 3D micromotions were noted between the primary and revision Tri-Lock BPS stems at all test points.\n\nInterpretation: The SHA (Tri-Lock BPS) provides good primary stability comparable to the standard THA (Corail). The Tri-Lock BPS stem achieves similar stability in revision scenarios, suggesting that the Corail standard stem can be safely revised with a Tri-Lock BPS short stem.\n\nTrial registration: Not provided.\n\nFunding: Not disclosed.",
