Participants were classified as nonobese (BMI <30 kg/m², n = 854) and obese (BMI ≥30 kg/m², n = 336). The primary outcomes were Short Form-36 physical function and bodily pain scores, and the Oswestry Disability Index, measured at baseline and up to four years. Randomisation and allocation concealment methods were not detailed. Blinding of outcome assessors, patients, and clinicians was not specified. An as-treated analysis was used.\n\nResults: At four years, obese patients demonstrated less improvement in primary outcomes compared to nonobese patients in both treatment groups. In the operative group, obese patients had lower improvements in Short Form-36 physical function (37.3 vs. 47.7, p < 0.001), bodily pain (44.2 vs. 50.0, p = 0.005), and Oswestry Disability Index (−33.7 vs. −40.1, p < 0.001). In the nonoperative group, differences were observed in physical function (23.1 vs. 32.0, p < 0.001) and Oswestry Disability Index (−21.4 vs. −26.1, p < 0.001). No significant differences in secondary outcomes were noted. Adverse events were not reported.\n\nInterpretation: Obesity is linked to reduced clinical benefit from both operative and nonoperative treatments for lumbar disc herniation. Surgery provided similar benefits over nonoperative treatment irrespective of BMI. The study highlights the need for tailored treatment strategies for obese patients.\n\nTrial registration: Not provided.\n\nFunding: Not specified.",
