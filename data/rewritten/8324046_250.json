A 250-word version\n\nTitle: A Randomised Controlled Trial Comparing Supraclavicular and Retroclavicular Brachial Plexus Block on Diaphragmatic Function\n\nBackground: The ultrasound-guided retroclavicular block (RCB) is a novel approach to brachial plexus blockade, potentially reducing phrenic nerve block incidence compared to the supraclavicular block (SCB).\n\nMethods: This double-blinded, randomised controlled trial was conducted at a single tertiary hospital from December 2017 to May 2019. Forty patients undergoing upper extremity surgery below the axilla were randomised to receive either SCB or RCB with ropivacaine 0.5%. Exclusion criteria included significant pulmonary disease, BMI >40, and contraindications to peripheral nerve block. Randomisation was computer-generated, and allocation was concealed using sealed envelopes. Both patients and outcome assessors were blinded. The primary outcome was the incidence of phrenic block, assessed by changes in diaphragmatic excursion and maximum inspiratory volume at baseline, 15, 30 minutes postblock, and postoperatively.\n\nResults: Forty patients were randomised, 20 to each group. The incidence of phrenic block was significantly higher in the SCB group (70% by ultrasound, 55% by spirometry) compared to the RCB group (15% by ultrasound, 5% by spirometry). Diaphragmatic excursion and inspiratory volume decreased more in the SCB group (p < 0.001). No significant differences were observed in distal arm block timing and extent. Adverse events were not reported.\n\nInterpretation: RCB is significantly less likely to impair ipsilateral diaphragmatic function than SCB. Trial registration: Clinicaltrials.gov NCT02631122.
