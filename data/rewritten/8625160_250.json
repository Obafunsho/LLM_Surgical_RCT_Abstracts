This study evaluates the efficacy of stem cell therapy in replacing fibrotic tissue with functional myocardium.\n\nMethods: This randomised controlled trial was conducted at multiple centers. Participants with ischemic cardiac injury and NYHA class I-III symptoms were eligible. Randomisation was performed using a computer-generated sequence with allocation concealment via sealed envelopes. Blinding included outcome assessors and patients. Participants were randomised to receive either stem cell therapy or placebo.\n\nIntervention: The intervention group received 150 million autologous BM MSCs, 5 million c-kit+ CPCs, or both via transendocardial injection. The control group received PlasmaLyte A.\n\nObjective: To assess the impact of stem cell therapy on cardiac function.\n\nOutcome: The primary outcome was the change in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) over six months.\n\nResults: A total of 144 participants were randomised, with 125 completing the study. LVEF changes were not significantly different between groups. However, major adverse cardiac events decreased significantly in the CPC group (p = 0.043). Quality of life scores improved in the MSC and MSC+CPC groups.\n\nHarm: No severe adverse events were reported.\n\nTrial registration: NCT02501811\n\nFunding: Supported by the National Institutes of Health.",
