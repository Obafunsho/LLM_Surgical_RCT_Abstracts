This study aimed to explore the relationship between RBC transfusion volume and mortality in burn patients.\n\nMethods: This retrospective cohort study included 379 patients with over 50% total body surface area burns admitted to three burn centers in China from January 2016 to June 2022. Patients were divided into high and low RBC transfusion groups based on a 6-unit threshold. Propensity score matching was used to adjust for differences in burn area, full thickness burned area, and inhalation injury. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality.\n\nResults: The relationship between RBC transfusion volume and mortality was L-shaped, with a significant increase in risk at low transfusion volumes (p < 0.0001). After propensity matching, there was no significant difference in mortality or bloodstream infection between the groups. However, the low RBC transfusion group had significantly shorter hospital stays, burn ICU stays, and mechanical ventilation times compared to the high RBC transfusion group (p < 0.001).\n\nInterpretation: The findings support a restrictive transfusion strategy in severely burned patients, as unnecessary RBC transfusions do not improve outcomes and may prolong hospital stays. This study highlights the importance of judicious use of blood products in burn care.",
