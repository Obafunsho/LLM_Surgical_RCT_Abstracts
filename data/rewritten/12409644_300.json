A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Acute Normovolemic Hemodilution in Cardiac Surgery\n\nBackground: Acute normovolemic hemodilution (ANH) is a blood conservation technique with low adoption in the US, despite cardiac surgery being a major consumer of blood components. This study evaluates ANH's effectiveness in reducing perioperative transfusion in cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB).\n\nMethods: This retrospective propensity-score matched cohort study used data from the Society of Thoracic Surgeons (STS) Adult Cardiac Surgery Database (version 4.20.2). Adult patients (≥18 years) undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and/or valve surgery with CPB from July 2020 to September 2023 were included. The primary exposure was ANH, defined as any recorded use/volume in the STS database. The primary outcome was intraoperative or postoperative transfusion of any blood component. Randomisation and allocation concealment methods were not applicable. Blinding was not performed.\n\nResults: Among 16,795 patients (mean age 65.3 years; 72.1% male), ANH was used in 2463 cases (14.7%). Patients receiving ANH had a lower preoperative anemia rate and higher baseline hematocrit. After propensity score matching (n=2282 pairs), transfusion rates were significantly lower in the ANH group (31.2% vs 36.4%; P<.001). ANH was associated with 27% lower odds of any transfusion (odds ratio, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.60-0.89). High-volume ANH (≥650 mL) further reduced transfusion odds by 47% to 64%. No adverse events were reported.\n\nInterpretation: ANH is associated with reduced transfusion rates in cardiac surgery, yet remains underused. Trial registration: N/A. Funding: Not specified.",
