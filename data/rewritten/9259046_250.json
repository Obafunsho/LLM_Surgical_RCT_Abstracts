A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of a Digital Behavioral Pain Management Intervention in Orthopedic Trauma Surgery\n\nBackground: This study evaluated the feasibility and efficacy of a digital behavioral pain management intervention, \"My Surgical Success\" (MSS), compared to a digital general health education (HE) intervention in orthopedic trauma surgery patients.\n\nMethods: A randomised controlled trial was conducted at an academic hospital in the San Francisco Bay area. Participants were adults aged 18-80 undergoing orthopedic trauma surgery. They were randomly assigned to MSS or HE using the REDCap system with a 1:1 ratio. Outcome assessors were blinded. The primary outcome was feasibility, assessed by treatment acceptability and engagement rate, measured up to 3 months post-surgery. Secondary outcomes included pain intensity, pain catastrophizing, and time to opioid cessation.\n\nResults: A total of 84 participants were randomised (MSS, n = 37; HE, n = 47) between December 2018 and January 2020. The engagement rate was 63%, with >80% of MSS participants reporting treatment acceptability. MSS participants showed greater reductions in pain intensity over time (F[215] = 5.23; P = .024). No significant differences were observed for opioid cessation or pain catastrophizing (F[215] = 0.20; P = .653). No adverse events were reported.\n\nInterpretation: MSS is a feasible and effective intervention for reducing postsurgical pain in motivated orthopedic trauma surgery patients. However, it did not significantly impact opioid cessation compared to HE. Trial registration: NCT03764839. Funding: Not specified.",
