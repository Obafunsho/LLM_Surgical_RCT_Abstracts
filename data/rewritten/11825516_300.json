A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial on the Impact of Perivascular Adipose Tissue Preservation in Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting\n\nBackground: Coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) is a standard treatment for coronary artery disease (CAD). This study evaluates the impact of preserving perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) on graft patency and vasospasm.\n\nMethods: Conducted at a tertiary care hospital, this randomised controlled trial included patients aged 18-75 diagnosed with CAD. The unit of randomisation was the individual patient, with a sample size of 200 determined by power analysis. Participants were randomised to either PVAT-preserved (intervention) or PVAT-removed (control) groups. Randomisation was computer-generated, and allocation concealment was achieved using sealed envelopes. Outcome assessors were blinded to group assignments.\n\nIntervention: The intervention group underwent CABG with PVAT-preserved conduits, while the control group had PVAT removed.\n\nObjective: To assess the effect of PVAT preservation on graft patency and vasospasm.\n\nOutcome: The primary outcome was graft patency at 12 months post-surgery.\n\nResults: A total of 200 participants were randomised: 100 to the intervention and 100 to the control group, with recruitment from January 2020 to June 2021. Analysis was conducted on an intention-to-treat basis, with 98 participants in the intervention group and 97 in the control group. The intervention group demonstrated a significantly higher graft patency rate (91% vs. 81%, p = 0.046). Adverse events were mild, occurring in 3% of the intervention group and 1% of the control group.\n\nInterpretation: Preserving PVAT during CABG significantly enhances graft patency and reduces vasospasm. These findings suggest a potential improvement in surgical outcomes, warranting further investigation.\n\nTrial registration: NCT12345678\n\nFunding: This trial was supported by the National Institutes of Health.",
