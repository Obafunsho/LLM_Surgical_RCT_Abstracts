A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Prehabilitation vs. Rehabilitation in Frail Patients Undergoing Colorectal Cancer Resection\n\nBackground: Prehabilitation is proposed to optimize physical status before and after colorectal cancer resection, but its effect on postoperative complications remains uncertain. This study assesses the impact of a prehabilitation program on 30-day postoperative complications in frail patients compared to postoperative rehabilitation.\n\nMethods: This single-blind, parallel-arm, superiority randomized clinical trial was conducted at two university-affiliated tertiary hospitals. Participants were frail patients (Fried Frailty Index ≥ 2) aged 65 years or older undergoing colorectal cancer resection. From 418 assessed, 120 were randomized, and 110 were included in the intention-to-treat analysis (55 in each group). The intervention was a multimodal program involving exercise, nutritional, and psychological components initiated before (Prehab) or after (Rehab) surgery. The primary outcome was the Comprehensive Complications Index at 30 days post-surgery. Randomization was computer-generated, and allocation was concealed. Outcome assessors were blinded.\n\nResults: The mean age was 78 years; 47.3% were men. No significant difference was found in the primary outcome (adjusted mean difference, –3.2; 95% CI, –11.8 to 5.3; P = .45). Secondary outcomes, including overall and severe complications, length of hospital stay, emergency department visits, hospital readmissions, recovery of walking capacity, and patient-reported outcomes, also showed no differences. No adverse events were reported.\n\nInterpretation: In frail patients undergoing colorectal cancer resection, a prehabilitation program did not affect postoperative outcomes. Alternative strategies should be considered to optimize treatment preoperatively. Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02502760. Funding: Not specified.",
