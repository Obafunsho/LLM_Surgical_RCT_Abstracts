A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of DFN-15 for Acute Pain Management Post-Dental Surgery\n\nBackground: This study assessed the efficacy and safety of DFN-15, a liquid celecoxib formulation, for acute pain following dental surgery.\n\nMethods: Conducted as a single-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging trial, 120 adults undergoing bilateral mandibular third molar extraction were randomized 1:1:1:1 to receive a single dose of placebo or DFN-15 (62.5, 125, or 250 mg). The primary outcome was the summed pain intensity difference (SPID) over 6 hours post-dose. Randomization was computer-generated, and allocation was concealed. Blinding included participants, clinicians, and outcome assessors. Recruitment occurred from June 19 to August 20, 2018.\n\nResults: All 120 participants were analyzed using a modified intent-to-treat approach. DFN-15 significantly reduced SPID6 compared to placebo (least square mean differences: −756.6, −1120.7, −1355.1; P < 0.0001 for all doses). DFN-15 also improved pain relief, treatment satisfaction, and reduced rescue medication use. Adverse events were similar between DFN-15 and placebo groups, with no dose-related trends. Specifically, 15.6% of DFN-15 participants and 13.3% of placebo participants reported treatment-emergent adverse events, primarily mild in severity.\n\nInterpretation: DFN-15 is effective and safe for managing acute pain post-dental surgery, offering rapid pain relief without increased adverse events. The liquid formulation provides a faster onset of action compared to traditional capsules, making it a valuable option for acute pain management.\n\nTrial registration: NCT03554772\n\nFunding: Dr. Reddy's Laboratories",
