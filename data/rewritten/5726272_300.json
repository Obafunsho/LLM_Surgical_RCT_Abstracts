A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of a Decision Aid to Improve Access to Total Knee Replacement Surgery for Black Patients with Osteoarthritis\n\nBackground: Black patients with advanced osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee are significantly less likely than white patients to undergo total knee replacement (TKR) surgery. This study assesses whether a decision aid improves access to TKR for black patients with OA of the knee.\n\nMethods: In this randomised clinical trial, 336 eligible participants who self-identified as black and were 50 years or older with chronic knee pain, a Western Ontario McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index score of at least 39, and radiographic evidence of knee OA were recruited from three medical centers between December 1, 2010, and May 31, 2014. Participants were randomised to receive either a 40-minute decision aid video on TKR or usual care. The primary outcome was receipt of TKR within 12 months. Randomisation was computer-generated, and allocation was concealed. Outcome assessors were blinded.\n\nResults: A total of 168 participants were randomised to each group. In the intention-to-treat analysis, 25 intervention patients (14.9%) and 13 controls (7.7%) underwent TKR within 12 months (P = .04), representing a 70% increase in the TKR rate. The adjusted odds ratio for TKR receipt was 2.10 (95% CI, 1.04–4.27). In the per-protocol analysis, the TKR rate increased by 86% (11 of 154 [7.1%] vs 23 of 150 [15.3%]; P = .02). No significant difference was found in surgery recommendations. No adverse events were reported.\n\nInterpretation: The decision aid increased TKR rates among black patients but did not significantly affect surgery recommendations. This patient-centered intervention may help address racial disparities in TKR use. Trial registration: clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT01851785. Funding: Not specified.",
