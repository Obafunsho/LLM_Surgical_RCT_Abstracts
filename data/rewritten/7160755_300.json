This study aims to assess the effectiveness and safety of negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) compared to conventional wound treatment (CWT) for SAWHI.\n\nMethods: Conducted in 34 abdominal surgical departments across Germany, Belgium, and the Netherlands, this multinational, multicenter, randomized clinical trial enrolled adult patients with SAWHI post-surgery. Participants were randomly assigned to NPWT or CWT in a 1:1 ratio using a centralized web-based tool, stratified by study site and wound size. The primary outcome was time to wound closure within 42 days. Randomization ensured allocation concealment, and outcome assessors were blinded.\n\nResults: Between August 2, 2011, and January 31, 2018, 539 patients were randomized, with 507 included in the modified intention-to-treat analysis (NPWT, 256; CWT, 251). The mean time to wound closure was significantly shorter in the NPWT arm (36.1 days) compared to the CWT arm (39.1 days) (difference, 3.0 days; 95% CI, 1.6-4.4; P < 0.001). The wound closure rate within 42 days was higher with NPWT (35.9%) than CWT (21.5%) (difference, 14.4%; 95% CI, 6.6%-22.2%; P < 0.001). In the therapy-compliant population, excluding participants with unauthorized treatment changes, the risk of wound-related adverse events was higher in the NPWT arm (risk ratio, 1.51; 95% CI, 0.99-2.35).\n\nInterpretation: NPWT is an effective treatment for SAWHI, achieving faster wound closure compared to CWT, but it is associated with a higher incidence of wound-related adverse events.
