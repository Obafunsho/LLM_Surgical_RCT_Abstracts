A 300-word version\n\nBackground: The study explores the use of low-frequency components of spontaneous functional MR imaging signals for presurgical motor function mapping in patients with tumors or epileptic foci near the motor cortex.\n\nMethods: Conducted at a single center, six surgical candidates were included based on the proximity of their tumors or epileptic foci to the motor cortex. The intervention involved mapping the motor network using intrinsic activity correlations, compared to task-elicited activation of the motor system. The primary outcome was the precision of motor function mapping, evaluated by comparing intrinsic activity correlations with task-elicited activation and direct cortical stimulation. Randomization and allocation concealment methods were not applicable. Blinding was not implemented.\n\nResults: The motor regions identified through intrinsic activity correlations closely matched those defined by task-elicited activation and cortical stimulation. The study demonstrated the feasibility of using intrinsic activity correlations for mapping the motor cortex in presurgical patients. No adverse events were reported.\n\nInterpretation: The task-free paradigm using intrinsic activity correlations provides a promising approach for mapping functional anatomy in patients unable to comply with tasks, allowing multiple brain systems to be assessed in a single scanning session. The study was not registered as a randomized controlled trial, and no funding information is available. The findings suggest that intrinsic activity correlations can effectively map motor regions, offering a valuable tool for presurgical planning. Further research with larger sample sizes and randomized controlled trial design is needed to validate these findings and explore the potential of this approach in clinical practice.",
