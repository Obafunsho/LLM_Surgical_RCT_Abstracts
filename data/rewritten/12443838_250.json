A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Liposomal Bupivacaine vs. Conventional Bupivacaine for Post-Thoracoscopic Analgesia\n\nBackground: This study evaluated the analgesic efficacy of liposomal bupivacaine (LB) compared to conventional bupivacaine hydrochloride for intercostal nerve block after thoracoscopic surgery.\n\nMethods: In this single-blind, randomised controlled trial, 100 patients (ASA II-III) scheduled for thoracoscopic surgery were enrolled at the Tenth Affiliated Hospital of Southern Medical University. Participants were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either LB or conventional bupivacaine under ultrasound guidance. The primary outcome was postoperative pain intensity measured by the Visual Analog Scale (VAS) at rest and during exercise at 6, 8, 12, 24, 48, and 72 hours post-surgery. Randomisation was computer-generated, and patients were blinded to treatment allocation.\n\nResults: Ninety-three patients were analysed (LB: 47, control: 46) using an intention-to-treat approach. The LB group had significantly lower VAS scores at all time points (p < 0.01). PCA demand was reduced in the LB group (median: 11 vs. 30 presses; p < 0.01). Patient satisfaction was higher in the LB group (mean: 9.0 vs. 7.0; p < 0.01). No significant differences were found in intraoperative remifentanil use or hospital stay. Adverse events were minimal and comparable between groups.\n\nInterpretation: LB provided effective 72-hour postoperative analgesia, reducing opioid use and improving patient satisfaction compared to conventional bupivacaine.
