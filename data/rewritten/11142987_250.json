A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Nicotinamide Riboside in Cardiac Ischemia-Reperfusion Injury\n\nBackground: Nicotinamide riboside (NR) is a precursor of NAD+ with potential cardioprotective effects. This study investigates NR's efficacy in protecting isolated mouse hearts from ischemia-reperfusion (IR) injury.\n\nMethods: This randomised controlled trial involved C57BL6/N adult male mice. Hearts were isolated and perfused using the Langendorff setup. Mice were randomised to receive either NR (50 mg/L) or vehicle control. The primary outcome was infarct size, measured by TTC staining after 90 minutes of reperfusion. Randomisation was achieved using a computer-generated sequence, and allocation was concealed. Blinding was maintained for outcome assessors.\n\nResults: A total of 16 mice were randomised, with 8 in each group. NR treatment significantly reduced infarct size compared to control (mean difference = 15%, 95% CI 10% to 20%; p < 0.01). No adverse events were reported in either group.\n\nInterpretation: NR effectively reduces infarct size in isolated mouse hearts subjected to IR injury, suggesting its potential as a cardioprotective agent. Further studies are needed to explore its mechanisms and clinical applicability.\n\nTrial registration: Not provided.\n\nFunding: Supported by institutional grants.",
