This study evaluates the efficacy of CNI-sparing regimens to address these concerns.\n\nMethods: This randomised controlled trial was conducted among kidney transplant recipients (KTRs) with low-to-moderate immunological risk. Participants were randomised to either a CNI-sparing regimen or a standard CNI-based regimen. Randomisation was computer-generated, and allocation was concealed. Outcome assessors were blinded to group assignments.\n\nIntervention: The intervention group received a CNI-sparing regimen, while the control group received standard CNI-based therapy.\n\nObjective: To evaluate the impact of CNI-sparing regimens on long-term allograft function.\n\nOutcome: The primary outcome was allograft function at 12 months, assessed by estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR).\n\nResults: A total of 200 participants were randomised: 100 to the intervention group and 100 to the control group. The analysis was conducted using an intention-to-treat approach. The intervention group demonstrated improved eGFR (mean difference = 5.2 mL/min/1.73 m², 95% CI 3.1 to 7.3; p = 0.01). Adverse events were mild, with 3% in the intervention group and 1% in the control group experiencing gastrointestinal side-effects.\n\nInterpretation: CNI-sparing regimens offer improved allograft function without significant adverse effects, presenting a viable alternative to standard CNI-based therapy. These findings suggest that CNI-sparing strategies could be beneficial for KTRs, particularly those at risk for CNI-related complications.\n\nTrial registration: N/A\n\nFunding: Not specified.",
