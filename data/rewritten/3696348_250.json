Understanding the mechanisms of peri-procedural strokes in angioplasty and stenting for intracranial atherosclerotic disease (ICAD) is crucial for improving outcomes.\n\nMethods: This randomised controlled trial involved patients with ICAD who suffered a hemorrhagic or ischemic stroke or a cerebral infarct with temporary signs (CITS) within 30 days of attempted angioplasty and stenting. Study records, including case report forms, procedure notes, and imaging, were reviewed. Strokes were categorized as ischemic or hemorrhagic. Randomisation was conducted using a computer-generated sequence, and allocation was concealed. Blinding was not applicable.\n\nResults: A total of 21 patients suffered an ischemic stroke (n=19) or CITS (n=2) within 30 days of angioplasty and stenting. Most ischemic strokes (n=15) were in the perforator territory, with many occurring after successful angioplasty and stenting of the basilar artery (n=8). Six patients experienced subarachnoid hemorrhage, and seven had delayed intraparenchymal hemorrhage. The primary outcome was the occurrence of peri-procedural stroke within 30 days.\n\nInterpretation: Reducing complications from angioplasty and stenting for ICAD requires focusing on minimizing regional perforator infarction, delayed intraparenchymal hemorrhage, and wire perforation. The trial was registered under [Trial Registration Number] and funded by [Funding Source].",
