This study aims to identify the optimal analgesic method.\n\nMethods: A network meta-analysis of 110 randomised controlled trials involving 8871 pregnant women was conducted. The trials were sourced from Embase, PubMed, Web of Science, and Cochrane databases. The primary outcome was the time to first postoperative request for analgesia. Secondary outcomes included postoperative medication-supplemented analgesia, pain scores at four postoperative time points, complications, and patient satisfaction. Randomisation and allocation concealment methods were not specified. Blinding details were not provided.\n\nResults: All modalities except wound infiltration prolonged the time to first analgesia request. Transversal abdominal block-type and lumbar quadratus block-type analgesia reduced opioid needs. Wound infiltration and transversalis fascia plane decreased nonopioid medication needs. Intrathecal morphine (IM) and epidural morphine had the best analgesic effect. Lateral transversus abdominis block and lumbar square muscle block reduced complications. IM with Petit transverse abdominal block showed the highest patient satisfaction. Adverse events were not detailed.\n\nInterpretation: Regional nerve block is a safe and effective postoperative analgesic modality. QLB III is the most effective for opioid-supplemented analgesia, while transversalis fascia plane is optimal for non-opioid analgesia.\n\nTrial registration: Registered with PROSPERO.\n\nFunding: Not specified.",
