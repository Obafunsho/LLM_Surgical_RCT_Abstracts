The study was conducted at a tertiary hospital from July 2021 to May 2023. The primary outcome was the change in N20 latency of somatosensory-evoked potentials (SEP) measured preoperatively and 30 minutes after anesthetic induction (T1). Randomisation was computer-generated with allocation concealment using opaque envelopes. Patients, surgeons, and outcome assessors were blinded.\n\nResults: 33 patients were randomised to each group, and all were analysed using an intention-to-treat approach. The change in N20 latency at T1 compared to preoperative values was not significantly different between Group R and Group P (mean difference = 0.2 ms, 95% CI -0.3 to 0.7; p = 0.45). Adverse events were similar between groups, with no severe complications reported. Trial registration: NCT04968054.\n\nFunding: The study was funded by the Yonsei University Health System.",
