A 300-word version\n\nBackground: This study explores the potential of the F(SVC)–J(RA) configuration in veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (V–V ECMO) to enhance systemic oxygenation in patients with severe respiratory failure. \n\nMethods: A detailed single-case analysis was performed on a 65-year-old male patient suffering from severe respiratory failure. The intervention involved positioning the drainage cannula tip into the superior vena cava (SVC) and crossing the reinfusion cannula in the right atrium (RA). The primary outcome was the partial pressure of arterial oxygen (PaO2), monitored throughout the ECMO treatment. \n\nResults: The patient exhibited a PaO2 exceeding 200 mmHg, even with minimal ventilation under lung rest conditions. The recirculation ratio was determined to be 20.0%, and transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) revealed no right-to-left shunt. The configuration allowed for effective drainage and reinfusion, maintaining high systemic oxygenation levels. \n\nInterpretation: The F(SVC)–J(RA) configuration appears to provide a significant advantage in achieving elevated systemic oxygenation during V–V ECMO, without requiring specialized devices such as dual lumen cannulae. This method could revolutionize V–V ECMO management in patients with severe respiratory failure. However, further research is necessary to validate these findings and evaluate the safety and efficacy of this configuration in a broader patient population.",
