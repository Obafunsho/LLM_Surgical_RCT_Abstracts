  "abstract": "250-word version:\n\nBackground: Endoleak is a significant complication of endovascular aortic repair (EVAR), associated with adverse long-term outcomes. This study aims to evaluate the classification, mechanisms, and imaging diagnosis of endoleaks.\n\nMethods: This review discusses five types of endoleaks, each with distinct characteristics and management approaches. Imaging modalities for endoleak detection include computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), ultrasonography, and angiography, each with unique advantages and limitations.\n\nResults: CT remains the gold standard for endoleak detection, but MRI and contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) show promise in specific scenarios. The article details imaging findings for each endoleak type, emphasizing the importance of multimodality imaging for accurate diagnosis. While CT is essential for early postoperative evaluation and reintervention planning, a tailored approach using various imaging techniques may optimize long-term surveillance.\n\nInterpretation: Future research should focus on establishing cost-effective, radiation-minimizing protocols for lifelong post-EVAR monitoring. The study highlights the need for a multimodal imaging approach to improve the detection and management of endoleaks, potentially enhancing patient outcomes.",
