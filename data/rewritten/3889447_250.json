Randomisation was performed using a computer-generated sequence, and allocation was concealed using sealed envelopes. IORA was administered as a bolus injection into a tibial intraosseous cannula below an inflated thigh tourniquet before skin incision. Subcutaneous fat and bone samples were collected intraoperatively to measure vancomycin concentrations. The primary outcome was tissue concentration of vancomycin, measured during the procedure.\n\nResults: Mean vancomycin concentrations in subcutaneous fat were 14 μg/g in the 250-mg IORA group, 44 μg/g in the 500-mg IORA group, and 3.2 μg/g in the systemic group. In bone, concentrations were 16 μg/g, 38 μg/g, and 4.0 μg/g, respectively. One patient in the systemic group developed red man syndrome. No other adverse events were reported.\n\nInterpretation: Low-dose IORA vancomycin achieves tissue concentrations equal or superior to systemic administration, potentially reducing systemic side effects while providing effective prophylaxis in TKA.\n\nTrial registration: [Trial registration number]\n\nFunding: [Source of funding]",
