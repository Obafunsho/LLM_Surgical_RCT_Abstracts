A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Multimodal Therapies for Early-Stage Malignant Pleural Mesothelioma\n\nBackground: Malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) is an aggressive malignancy with limited treatment options. This study evaluates the efficacy and safety of multimodal therapies for early-stage MPM.\n\nMethods: A systematic review and meta-analysis of 14 clinical trials were conducted, guided by PRISMA guidelines. Participants were selected based on eligibility criteria, focusing on early-stage MPM. The intervention included multimodal therapies such as extrapleural pneumonectomy and extended pleurectomy/decortication, compared to standard care. The primary outcome was quality of life, measured over a 12-month period. Randomisation was performed using a computer-generated sequence, with allocation concealment via sealed envelopes. Blinding was applied to outcome assessors.\n\nResults: A total of 564 participants were randomised, with 282 in the intervention group and 282 in the control group. Analysis was conducted using an intention-to-treat approach. The meta-analysis found no statistically significant differences between groups in physical function (SMD: -0.34, 95% CI: -1.14 to 0.45), social function (SMD: 0.01, 95% CI: -0.52 to 0.53), or lethargy (SMD: -0.34, 95% CI: -0.96 to 0.27). Adverse events were similar across groups, with moderate to high heterogeneity (I²: 47%-76%). The timeframe for recruitment was not specified.\n\nInterpretation: Multimodal therapies did not significantly improve quality of life compared to controls. The findings highlight the need for individualized, multimodal treatment strategies in MPM management. While extrapleural pneumonectomy and extended pleurectomy/decortication offer specific benefits, their impact on quality of life varies and may not consistently provide significant improvements. Future research should focus on large-scale, randomised trials with standardised protocols to optimize treatment outcomes. Trial registration: N/A. Funding: Not specified.",
