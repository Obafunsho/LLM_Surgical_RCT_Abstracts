A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Magnesium Therapy in Carotid Endarterectomy\n\nBackground: Magnesium has shown cerebral protection in animal stroke models, but its use in humans is limited by side effects. This study examines the incidence of α-agonist treated hypotension in patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy.\n\nMethods: In this prospective, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase I/IIa dose escalation trial, 80 patients undergoing elective carotid endarterectomy were randomised to a placebo group (n = 38) or one of three intravenous magnesium groups. Randomisation was computer-generated, and allocation was concealed. Magnesium levels were measured at baseline and at multiple intervals post-infusion. The primary outcome was the amount and duration of phenylephrine required to maintain target systolic blood pressure post-surgery. Blinding included patients, clinicians, and outcome assessors.\n\nResults: All treatment groups achieved significantly different magnesium levels from baseline at 12 and 24 hours (P < 0.01). There was no significant increase in the proportion of patients requiring pressure support in the magnesium groups compared to controls. The amount and duration of phenylephrine required were similar across groups, regardless of magnesium dose.\n\nInterpretation: Magnesium therapy did not significantly affect the need for postoperative pressor support compared to placebo. The requirement for pressure support was influenced by the minimum systolic blood pressure ordered post-surgery. No adverse events were reported.\n\nTrial registration: [Trial registration number]\n\nFunding: [Source of funding]",
