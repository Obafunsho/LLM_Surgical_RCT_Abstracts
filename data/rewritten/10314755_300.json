A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of a Novel Surgeon-Placed Adductor Canal Block in Total Knee Arthroplasty\n\nBackground: Effective pain management in total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is crucial, with a shift towards non-opioid modalities. This study investigates a novel surgeon-placed adductor canal block (ACB) with catheter placement for continuous regional nerve block, hypothesizing reduced pain and opioid use post-TKA.\n\nMethods: Conducted as a randomised controlled trial from July to November 2017, 56 consecutive patients undergoing primary TKA by a single surgeon were included. Participants were randomly assigned to receive either the novel ACB technique or a standard single-shot ACB by anesthesia. The primary outcome was perioperative pain, assessed using a visual analog scale (VAS) over seven days postoperatively. Randomisation was based on consecutive patient presentation, with no blinding of patients or clinicians. The study setting was a single surgical center.\n\nResults: Of the 56 patients, 48 initiated the survey, and 36 completed it. The novel ACB group experienced a 25% reduction in VAS pain scores (3.9 to 2.9), a 24% reduction in opioid use, and significant reductions in side effects such as dizziness, nausea, and vomiting compared to the control group. Length of stay was reduced to 23 hours. No adverse events were reported in the novel ACB group.\n\nInterpretation: The surgeon-placed ACB technique offers potential benefits in reducing pain and opioid consumption without adverse effects, suggesting a viable alternative to traditional methods. Further research is warranted to validate these findings. Trial registration and funding details were not provided.",
