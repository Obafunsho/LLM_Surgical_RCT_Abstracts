This study aimed to determine the mechanisms and treatment of rejection in kidney transplant recipients under belatacept-based early corticosteroid withdrawal following T cell depleting induction.\n\nMethods: In this randomised controlled trial, peripheral mononuclear cells, serum creatinine levels, and renal biopsies were collected from 8 patients experiencing belatacept-refractory rejection. Flow cytometry, histology, and immunofluorescence were used to characterize CD8+ effector memory T cell (T_EM) populations before and after mTOR inhibition with everolimus. The trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov (#NCT01729494).\n\nResults: Patients with belatacept-refractory rejection did not respond to standard antirejection therapy and showed a substantial increase in alloreactive CD8+ T_EM cells with a CD28 low/DR hi/CD38 hi/CD45RO+ phenotype. These cells had increased activation of the mTOR pathway, as assessed by phosphorylated ribosomal protein S6 (p-RPS6) expression. Everolimus treatment halted the in vivo proliferation of T_EM cells, reduced their ex vivo alloreactivity, and significantly decreased their presence in peripheral blood. The frequency of circulating FoxP3+ regulatory T cells was not altered. Everolimus led to rapid resolution of rejection as confirmed by histology.\n\nInterpretation: Everolimus may provide an effective \"rescue\" therapy for rejections occurring under belatacept that are refractory to traditional antirejection therapy. The study highlights the potential of mTOR inhibition in managing belatacept-refractory rejection. Trial registration: clinicaltrials.gov #NCT01729494. Funding: Not specified.",
