Pulmonary endarterectomy (PEA) remains the sole potentially curative intervention.\n\nMethods: This randomised controlled trial was conducted across four leading CTEPH centers. Eligible participants were adults with a confirmed diagnosis of operable CTEPH. Participants were randomised to either undergo PEA or receive standard medical therapy. The primary outcome was the change in pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) at 6 months post-intervention. Randomisation was performed using a computer-generated sequence, with allocation concealment ensured through sealed envelopes. Blinding was applied to outcome assessors.\n\nResults: A total of 200 participants were randomised: 100 to the PEA group and 100 to the control group, during the recruitment period from January 2020 to June 2021. In the intention-to-treat analysis, 98 participants in the PEA group and 97 in the control group were analysed. The PEA group demonstrated a significant reduction in PVR compared to the control group (mean difference = 5.2 mm Hg, 95% CI 3.1 to 7.3; p = 0.01). Adverse events were observed in 3/100 (3%) of the PEA group and 1/98 (1%) of the control group, primarily mild gastrointestinal side-effects.\n\nInterpretation: The findings indicate that PEA significantly reduces PVR in patients with operable CTEPH compared to standard medical therapy, with a low rate of adverse events. These results support the use of PEA as the treatment of choice in suitable candidates.\n\nTrial registration: [Trial registration number]\n\nFunding: This research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public, commercial, or not-for-profit sectors.",
