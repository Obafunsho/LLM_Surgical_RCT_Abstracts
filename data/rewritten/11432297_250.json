A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial on the Impact of Vitamin Supplementation on Cardiovascular Health\n\nBackground: Vitamins play a crucial role in regulating biochemical and metabolic pathways affecting cardiovascular function. This study investigates the impact of vitamin supplementation on cardiovascular disease (CVD) prevention.\n\nMethods: This randomised controlled trial was conducted with participants recruited from a cardiovascular clinic. Eligibility criteria included adults with a history of cardiovascular risk factors. Participants were randomly assigned to receive either vitamin supplementation or a placebo. Randomisation was computer-generated, and allocation was concealed using sealed envelopes. Blinding was maintained for participants, clinicians, and outcome assessors.\n\nIntervention: The intervention group received a combination of hydrophilic and lipophilic vitamins, while the control group received a placebo.\n\nObjective: To evaluate the efficacy of vitamin supplementation in preventing CVD.\n\nOutcome: The primary outcome was the incidence of cardiovascular events over a 12-month period.\n\nResults: A total of 200 participants were randomised, with 100 in each group. Analysis was conducted on 98 participants in the intervention group and 97 in the control group using an intention-to-treat approach. The intervention group showed a significant reduction in cardiovascular events (mean difference = 5.2 events, 95% CI 3.1 to 7.3; p = 0.01). Adverse events were mild, with 3% in the intervention group and 1% in the control group experiencing gastrointestinal side-effects.\n\nInterpretation: Vitamin supplementation may contribute to the prevention of CVD in at-risk individuals. Further research is needed to confirm these findings.\n\nTrial registration: [Trial registration number]\n\nFunding: The study was funded by [source of funding].",
