This study aimed to compare the time to lung insufflation between a surgical technique using a bougie/endotracheal tube (ETT) and an open technique using the Melker catheter.\n\nMethods: A randomised crossover trial was conducted at Nepean Hospital from June 2022 to January 2023. Participants were emergency physicians (EPs) and trainees trained in both techniques. The primary outcome was the time to first insufflation of the artificial lung. Randomisation was achieved via block randomisation with random block sizes. Participants were not blinded to the technique.\n\nResults: Thirty-six participants (17 EPs, 19 trainees) were randomised to perform both techniques. The Melker catheter technique was quicker, with a mean time of 29.2 seconds compared to 44.3 seconds for the bougie/ETT technique (difference 15.1 seconds, 95% CI 10.8–19.4 seconds). The Melker catheter was preferred by 61% of participants, though comfort ratings did not differ significantly. Time to insufflation was unaffected by training level or time since last cricothyrotomy.\n\nInterpretation: The Melker catheter technique was faster and preferred by participants, suggesting it may be advantageous in emergency settings. No adverse events were reported. The study was approved by the Nepean Hospital Human Research and Ethics Committee. Trial registration and funding details were not provided.",
