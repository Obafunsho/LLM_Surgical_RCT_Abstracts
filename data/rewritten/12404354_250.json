A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Chemical Biomarkers in Post-Amputation Healing\n\nBackground: Poor post-amputation healing delays prosthetic fitting, affecting mortality and quality of life. Current assessments lack standardization, necessitating objective biomarkers for improved healing evaluation.\n\nMethods: This scoping review followed JBI and PRISMA-ScR guidelines. Searches using “biomarkers,” “wound healing,” and “amputation” were conducted across multiple databases. Inclusion criteria included references to chemical biomarkers, residuum tissue healing, and ethical approval. Articles were evaluated for quality and evidence level, categorized by study type, wound type, and model. Repeated chemical biomarkers and quantification methods were reported.\n\nResults: From 3,306 screened titles and abstracts, 646 underwent full-text review, and 203 met criteria for data extraction, with 76% classified as strong quality. Thirty-eight chemical biomarkers were identified, with interleukins and HbA1c most prevalent. Other biomarkers included predictive blood markers, indicative growth factors, and diagnostic proteins.\n\nInterpretation: Predictive biomarkers aid pre-amputation risk assessment, indicative biomarkers monitor healing processes, and diagnostic biomarkers provide insights into tissue healing. Integrating these biomarkers into assessments enhances objectivity and personalizes rehabilitation strategies.",
