The primary outcome was the incidence of surgical site infections (SSIs), measured over the postoperative period. Randomisation was conducted at the participant level, with allocation concealment ensured. Blinding was applied to outcome assessors, patients, and clinicians. The study setting included various international locations, and eligibility criteria focused on clean and clean-contaminated surgeries.\n\nResults: The pooled odds ratio (OR) for SSIs with antibiotic prophylaxis versus placebo was 0.60 (95% CI: 0.53–0.68). Subgroup analyses showed pooled ORs for gastrointestinal, oncology, orthopedics, neurosurgery, oral, and urology surgeries. The summary mean difference (MD) for length of hospitalization was −0.91 days (95% CI: −1.61, −0.16). Sensitivity analyses confirmed the stability of these results. Adverse events were not reported.\n\nInterpretation: Prophylactic antibiotics significantly reduce SSIs and hospital stay length in clean and clean-contaminated surgeries. The study supports their continued use in these procedures. The findings are consistent across various surgical disciplines, indicating a broad applicability of prophylactic antibiotics in reducing postoperative complications.\n\nTrial registration: PROSPERO CRD42023445822.\n\nFunding: No specific funding was received.",
