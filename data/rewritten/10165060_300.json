A 300-word version\n\nTitle: A Randomised Controlled Trial Comparing Free Dermal Fat Graft and Superficial Musculoaponeurotic System Flap in Superficial Parotidectomy\n\nBackground: Parotidectomy is a standard treatment for benign parotid lesions but can result in complications such as facial asymmetry and Frey’s syndrome. This randomised controlled trial aimed to compare the effectiveness of free dermal fat graft (FDFG) and superficial musculoaponeurotic system (SMAS) flap in reducing these complications.\n\nMethods: Conducted at a single centre, this prospective study included 78 adult patients undergoing superficial conservative parotidectomy for benign indications. Participants were randomised into two equal groups using a closed envelope method: one group received FDFG, and the other received SMAS flap. The primary outcome was the development of Frey’s syndrome, assessed at 6 months postoperatively. Randomisation was concealed, and outcome assessors were blinded. Sample size was calculated to detect differences in Frey’s syndrome incidence with 80% power and a 5% significance level.\n\nResults: Between February 2016 and October 2021, 78 patients were randomised equally. There was no significant difference in the incidence of Frey’s syndrome between the FDFG and SMAS groups. Aesthetic satisfaction was high in both groups, with no poor results reported. Over correction was more common in the FDFG group, while under correction was more frequent in the SMAS group. No significant differences were found in demographic data, co-morbidities, parotid pathologies, specimen volumes, total operating time, or postoperative complications. Adverse events were minimal, with mild infection and seroma occurring only in the FDFG group.\n\nInterpretation: Both FDFG and SMAS flap are simple, rapid, and reliable procedures that effectively improve functional and aesthetic outcomes post-parotidectomy. The choice between procedures can be guided by patient and tumour characteristics. Trial registration: NCT05452837. Funding: Not specified.",
