This study examines the impact of removing race correction on surgical recommendations.\n\nMethods: This randomised controlled trial was conducted in hospitals participating in a statewide quality collaborative. Eligibility criteria included hospitals performing lung cancer surgery using race-corrected PFTs. Participants were African American patients who underwent lung cancer resection between January 1, 2015, and September 31, 2022. Surgeons were randomised to receive clinical vignettes with race-corrected or race-neutral PFTs. The primary outcome was the change in treatment recommendations, assessed immediately after vignette presentation. Randomisation was computer-generated, and allocation was concealed. Blinding was not applicable.\n\nResults: Of 515 African American patients, 473 (91.8%) had race-corrected PFTs. Using race-neutral equations, preoperative and postoperative FEV1 would have decreased by 9.2% (95% CI, −9.0% to −9.5%) and 7.6% (95% CI, −7.3% to −7.9%), respectively. Among 225 surgeons, those receiving race-corrected vignettes recommended lobectomy more frequently (79.2%; 95% CI, 69.8%-88.5%) compared to those with race-neutral (52.8%; 95% CI, 41.2%-64.3%) or other race/multiracial vignettes (61.7%; 95% CI, 51.1%-72.3%).\n\nInterpretation: The removal of race correction in PFTs may significantly alter treatment decisions, potentially worsening disparities in lung cancer surgery among African American patients. No adverse events were reported. Trial registration: [Trial registration number]. Funding: [Source of funding].",
