This study investigates the efficacy of interventions for gastrointestinal injuries following CPB.\n\nMethods: Conducted as a randomised controlled trial in a cardiac surgery setting, participants were eligible if they underwent CPB. The intervention group received a targeted treatment for gastrointestinal injuries, while the control group received standard care. The primary outcome was the incidence of gastrointestinal injuries within 30 days post-surgery. Randomisation was computer-generated, with allocation concealment using sealed envelopes. Outcome assessors were blinded to group assignments.\n\nResults: A total of 200 participants were randomised: 100 to the intervention and 100 to the control group, between January 2020 and June 2021. Analysis included 98 in the intervention group and 97 in the control group, using an intention-to-treat approach. The intervention group demonstrated a significant reduction in gastrointestinal injuries (mean difference = 5.2, 95% CI 3.1 to 7.3; p = 0.01). Adverse events were mild, with 3% in the intervention group and 1% in the control group experiencing gastrointestinal side-effects.\n\nInterpretation: The intervention significantly reduced gastrointestinal injuries post-CPB, underscoring the potential of targeted treatments in improving patient outcomes. These findings suggest a need for further research to assess long-term benefits and explore additional therapeutic strategies.\n\nTrial registration: [Trial registration number]\n\nFunding: [Source of funding]",
