A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Therapeutic Plasma Exchange in Cardiac Surgery Patients with Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia\n\nBackground: Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is an antibody-mediated condition that complicates cardiac surgery requiring cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). This study evaluates the impact of intraoperative therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) on thromboembolic events, bleeding, and mortality in HIT patients undergoing CPB.\n\nMethods: This randomised controlled trial was conducted at a tertiary care center. Participants included patients diagnosed with HIT requiring cardiac surgery with CPB. Patients were randomised to receive TPE with heparin re-exposure or standard care. The primary outcome was the incidence of HIT-related thromboembolic events within 7 days post-surgery. Randomisation was computer-generated, and allocation was concealed using sealed envelopes. Blinding was not feasible due to the nature of the intervention.\n\nResults: A total of 24 patients were randomised, with 12 in each group. Three patients (12.5%) died within 30 days post-surgery, none of which were HIT-related. Thromboembolic events occurred in 3 patients, with 2 possibly HIT-related. The effect size for thromboembolic events was not statistically significant. No significant differences in bleeding or mortality were observed between groups.\n\nInterpretation: TPE with heparin re-exposure did not significantly increase HIT-related thromboembolic events or mortality in cardiac surgery patients with CPB. Further studies are needed to confirm these findings.\n\nTrial registration: [Trial registration number]\n\nFunding: [Source of funding]",
