Patients with grade III or IV haemorrhoids were randomised 1:1 to either no tamponade (intervention) or tamponade (control) groups. The primary outcomes were maximum pain intensity within 48 hours post-surgery (superiority) and severe bleeding requiring surgical re-intervention within 7 days (non-inferiority). Randomisation was centre-stratified with variable block sizes, and allocation was concealed via a web-based tool. No blinding was implemented.\n\nResults: Between May 2017 and November 2020, 754 patients were randomised (366 intervention, 359 control). The intervention group reported lower median pain intensity (5, i.q.r. 3–7) compared to the control group (6, i.q.r. 4–7), P < 0.001. Severe bleeding occurred in 1.1% of patients in both groups, with a non-inferiority margin of −0.03% (90% CI −1.47% to +1.41%). Adverse events were similar between groups, with 10 serious adverse events recorded (3 intervention, 7 control), including urinary retention, wound infections, fever, and vomiting. Health-related quality of life and patient satisfaction were comparable between groups.\n\nInterpretation: Omitting tamponade dressings reduces postoperative pain without increasing severe bleeding risk. The trial was prematurely stopped due to the COVID-19 pandemic, but results support the omission of tamponade dressings in clinical practice. Trial registration: DRKS00011590.
