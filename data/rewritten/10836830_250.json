A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Probe-Based Near Infrared Autofluorescence for Parathyroid Identification\n\nBackground: Intraoperative identification of parathyroid glands during parathyroidectomy is challenging and often requires costly frozen sections. This study evaluates the benefits of probe-based near infrared autofluorescence (NIRAF) for parathyroid identification.\n\nMethods: This randomised controlled trial enrolled patients undergoing parathyroidectomy for primary hyperparathyroidism at a single institution. Participants were randomly allocated to either the probe-based NIRAF group or the control group. The primary outcome was the number of parathyroids identified with high confidence by the surgeon and resident, measured intraoperatively. Randomisation was performed using a computer-generated sequence, and allocation was concealed using sealed envelopes. Blinding was not feasible due to the nature of the intervention.\n\nResults: A total of 160 patients were randomised, with 80 in each group. The senior surgeon's identification rate improved significantly in the probe group from 3.2 to 3.6 parathyroids per patient (p<0.001), and the junior surgeon's rate increased from 2.2 to 2.5 (p=0.001). Residents showed a significant increase from 0.9 to 2.9 parathyroids per patient (p<0.001). The probe group required fewer frozen sections (17 vs 47, p=0.005). No adverse events were reported.\n\nInterpretation: Probe-based NIRAF is a valuable adjunct for improving parathyroid identification and reducing frozen section use. The trial was registered under [Trial Registration Number] and funded by [Funding Source].",
