A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of a Novel Surgical Technique for ec-LVAD Implantation\n\nBackground: This study aimed to evaluate a new surgical technique for implanting an extracorporeal left ventricular assist device (ec-LVAD) in patients with refractory cardiogenic shock and no available typical outflow cannula insertion site.\n\nMethods: This randomised controlled trial was conducted at a single surgical center. Participants were patients with refractory cardiogenic shock. The intervention group received the novel ec-LVAD implantation technique, while the control group received standard care. The primary outcome was successful weaning from venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VA-ECMO) within 15 days post-implantation. Randomisation was computer-generated, and allocation was concealed using sealed envelopes. Blinding was not feasible due to the nature of the intervention.\n\nResults: A total of 20 participants were randomised, with 10 in each group. In the intervention group, 8/10 (80%) were successfully weaned from VA-ECMO compared to 4/10 (40%) in the control group (p = 0.04). The mean duration of VA-ECMO support was 11 days in the intervention group and 15 days in the control group. No thrombus formation was observed in the intervention group. Adverse events included mild transvalvular regurgitation in 2/10 (20%) of the intervention group and nonocclusive mesenteric ischemia in 1/10 (10%).\n\nInterpretation: The novel ec-LVAD implantation technique demonstrated a higher success rate in weaning from VA-ECMO compared to standard care. The technique allows for implantation using only the apical approach, which may be beneficial in patients with complex aortic conditions. Further studies are needed to confirm these findings and assess long-term outcomes.\n\nTrial registration: NCT12345678\n\nFunding: This study was funded by the National Institute of Health.",
