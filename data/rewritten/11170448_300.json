A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Timing of Adjuvant Chemotherapy in Colorectal Cancer: A Randomised Controlled Trial\n\nBackground: The timing of adjuvant chemotherapy after colorectal cancer surgery is debated, with implications for disease-free survival. This study evaluates the impact of chemotherapy timing on outcomes.\n\nMethods: This post hoc analysis of the phase 3 SCOT trial included 5719 patients from 244 centers in 6 countries. Eligible participants had high-risk stage II or III nonmetastatic colorectal cancer and underwent curative surgery. They were randomized to 3 or 6 months of adjuvant chemotherapy with fluoropyrimidine and oxaliplatin. Randomization was computer-generated with allocation concealment. Patients were grouped by chemotherapy start: <6 weeks vs >6 weeks post-surgery. The primary outcome was disease-free survival over a median follow-up of 72 months. Analysis was intention-to-treat.\n\nResults: Of 5719 patients, 914 were in the early-start group and 4805 in the late-start group. Five-year disease-free survival was 78.0% in the early-start group compared to 73.2% in the late-start group (hazard ratio, 1.24; 95% CI, 1.06-1.46; P = .01). Adverse events were similar between groups, with no significant difference in the total treatment period (odds ratio, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.65-1.04; P = .09) or the first cycle (odds ratio, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.56-1.09; P = .13).\n\nInterpretation: Delaying adjuvant chemotherapy beyond 6 weeks post-surgery is linked to poorer disease-free survival, without increased adverse events.
