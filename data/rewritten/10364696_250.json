A 250-word version\n\nTitle: A Randomised Controlled Trial Comparing Scar Quality After Hydrosurgical Versus Conventional Debridement in Burn Patients\n\nBackground: This trial aimed to compare scar quality following hydrosurgical versus conventional debridement before split-skin grafting in burn patients.\n\nMethods: A multicentre, double-blind, randomised controlled trial was conducted within patients at three specialized burn centres in the Netherlands. Eligible participants had burns requiring split-skin grafting. Each patient had two wound areas, one randomised to hydrosurgical debridement and the other to Weck knife debridement. The primary outcome was scar quality at 12 months, assessed using the observer part of the Patient and Observer Scar Assessment Scale (POSAS). Randomisation was performed using a web-based system, and allocation was concealed. Both patients and outcome assessors were blinded.\n\nResults: A total of 137 patients were randomised between January 2017 and July 2019. At 12 months, the hydrosurgically debrided wounds had a lower POSAS observer total item score (mean difference -0.12, 95% CI -0.22 to -0.02; p = 0.023) and overall opinion score (mean difference -0.22, 95% CI -0.34 to -0.09; p = 0.006). Patient-reported scar quality and pliability were significantly better for hydrosurgically debrided wounds. No significant differences in complication rates were observed. Histologically, more dermis was preserved with hydrosurgery (p < 0.001).\n\nInterpretation: Hydrosurgical debridement resulted in better scar quality and pliability at one year, likely due to enhanced dermal preservation.\n\nTrial registration: Trial NL6085 (NTR6232).\n\nFunding: This study was funded by the Dutch Burns Foundation (grant number 15.101).",
