A 250-word version\n\nBackground: This study aimed to evaluate the risk factors and patterns of local recurrence in rectal carcinoma patients treated at the National Cancer Center Hospital, Tokyo, between 1993 and 2002. Methods: In this retrospective cohort study, 351 patients with rectal carcinoma at or below the peritoneal reflection were analyzed. Patients with T1 or T2 tumors without suspected lymph nodes underwent total mesorectal excision (TME), while those with suspected T3 or T4 disease or positive lymph nodes received lateral lymph node dissection (LLND). Seventy-three patients underwent unilateral LLND, and 133 underwent bilateral LLND. Results: The 5-year local recurrence rate was 6.6% overall. TME alone resulted in a 0.8% recurrence rate. In lymph-node-positive patients, the unilateral LLND group had a 33% local relapse rate, significantly higher than the 14% in the bilateral LLND group (p = 0.04). Local recurrence in lateral, presacral, perineal, and anastomotic subsites was lower in the bilateral LLND group. Interpretation: Bilateral LLND is more effective in reducing local recurrence than unilateral LLND in lymph-node-positive patients. Reliable imaging is essential for surgical planning. Trial registration: Not applicable. Funding: Not specified.",
