A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Revascularization vs. Non-Operative Management in Intermittent Claudication\n\nBackground: Revascularization is recommended for intermittent claudication (IC) to enhance function and quality of life, but its superiority over medical management is uncertain.\n\nMethods: This randomised controlled trial was conducted at an academic medical center from 2016 to 2021. IC patients were randomised to revascularization (bypass or PVI) or non-operative management (medication and exercise therapy). The primary outcome was patient-reported physical function (PROMIS-PF) and satisfaction in social roles (PROMIS-SA) over a follow-up of up to 7 years. Randomisation was computer-generated, with allocation concealment ensured. Blinding was not applicable due to the nature of interventions. Sample size was determined to detect a clinically significant difference in PROMIS scores.\n\nResults: A total of 225 patients were randomised: 89 to revascularization and 136 to non-operative management. Analysis was conducted using a linear mixed-effect model adjusted for age, sex, diabetes, Charlson Comorbidity Index, Clinical Frailty Score, tobacco use, and index ABI. No significant differences were found in PROMIS-PF between groups over time (P=0.07). PROMIS-SA improved significantly in all patients (P=0.019), with greater improvement in the non-operative group (P=0.045). No adverse events were reported.\n\nInterpretation: Both revascularization and non-operative management yield similar long-term functional outcomes in IC patients. Non-operative management may offer better satisfaction in social roles, supporting conservative treatment. These findings suggest that non-operative management is a viable long-term strategy for IC.\n\nTrial registration: [Trial registration number]\n\nFunding: [Source of funding]",
