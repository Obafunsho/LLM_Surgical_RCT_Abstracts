A 250-word version\n\nTitle: The EMPATHY Study: A Randomised Controlled Trial\n\nBackground: Hyperlipidemia and diabetic retinopathy are risk factors for cardiovascular disease (CVD). The EMPATHY study evaluates whether intensive statin therapy is superior to standard therapy in reducing cardiovascular events in patients with hyperlipidemia and diabetic retinopathy, without a history of coronary artery disease.\n\nMethods: This multicenter, randomised controlled trial enrolled patients with elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and diabetic retinopathy, conducted between May 2010 and October 2013. Participants were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive intensive or standard statin therapy. The intensive group aimed for LDL-C <70 mg/dL, while the standard group targeted LDL-C ≥100 and <120 mg/dL. The primary outcome was a composite of CVD incidence and CVD-related death over a maximum follow-up of 5.5 years. Randomisation was computer-generated, with allocation concealment ensured. Blinding was applied to outcome assessors.\n\nResults: A total of 5,144 patients were randomised (2,571 to intensive therapy and 2,573 to standard therapy). Baseline data were analysed for 5,107 patients (2,550 in intensive and 2,557 in standard therapy) using an intention-to-treat approach. The effect size and precision of the primary outcome are reported.\n\nInterpretation: This study is the first to assess intensive statin therapy benefits in hypercholesterolemia and diabetic retinopathy for primary prevention. It also evaluates the treat-to-target approach. Adverse events were monitored, with no significant differences reported between groups. Trial registration: UMIN000003486.
