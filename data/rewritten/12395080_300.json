A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Quantitative EEG in Delirium Subtypes\n\nBackground: Delirium, a manifestation of acute encephalopathy with heterogeneous etiology, presents significant clinical challenges. This study aimed to investigate whether quantitative electroencephalography (qEEG) characteristics differ among etiology-based delirium subtypes or converge on common neurophysiological patterns.\n\nMethods: In this multicenter observational study, we analyzed qEEG data from 377 patients (173 delirious, 204 non-delirious) across three sites. Participants were assigned to post-stroke, medical, or postoperative delirium subtypes based on DSM-IV or DSM-5 criteria. We compared peak frequency, relative power, and phase lag index (PLI) between delirious and non-delirious patients using standardized mean differences (SMDs) with 95% confidence intervals (CI).\n\nResults: Among spectral qEEG measures, there were no differences between subgroups. Peak frequency consistently decreased in all delirium groups compared to controls (SMD = -0.81, CI: -1.50 to -0.13), relative delta power increased (SMD = 1.44, CI: 0.61 to 2.26), and relative beta power decreased (SMD = -1.72, CI: -2.46 to -0.97). PLI differences were small and inconsistent across subtypes.\n\nInterpretation: Our findings demonstrate consistent patterns in spectral qEEG characteristics across delirium subtypes, suggesting a common neurophysiological pathway of global EEG slowing in delirium regardless of etiology. By contrast, differences in PLI did not converge across subtypes. Multicenter studies should harmonize data collection to disentangle the shared and distinct neurophysiological changes associated with delirium of varying etiologies, in order to advance our understanding of potentially convergent mechanisms across subtypes.\n\nFunding: The study was funded by institutional resources.",
