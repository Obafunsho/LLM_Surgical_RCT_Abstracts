A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial on Endothelial Dysfunction in Single-Ventricle Congenital Heart Disease\n\nBackground: Endothelial dysfunction is a key factor in chronic diseases and is increasingly recognized in single-ventricle congenital heart disease (SV-CHD). This study evaluates the impact of endothelial dysfunction across all stages of SV-CHD palliation.\n\nMethods: This randomised controlled trial was conducted at a tertiary care center. Participants included SV-CHD patients eligible for surgical palliation. Randomisation was performed using a computer-generated sequence with allocation concealment via sealed envelopes. Blinding was applied to outcome assessors. The intervention group received standard surgical and pharmacological treatment, while the control group received standard care without targeted endothelial interventions.\n\nObjective: To assess the effect of targeted interventions on endothelial dysfunction in SV-CHD patients.\n\nOutcome: The primary outcome was the change in endothelial function, measured by flow-mediated dilation, over a 12-month period.\n\nResults: A total of 200 participants were randomised: 100 to the intervention group and 100 to the control group, between January 2020 and June 2021. Analysis was conducted on 98 participants in the intervention group and 97 in the control group using an intention-to-treat approach. The intervention group showed a significant improvement in endothelial function (mean difference = 5.2%, 95% CI 3.1 to 7.3; p = 0.01). Adverse events were mild, with 3% in the intervention group and 1% in the control group experiencing gastrointestinal side-effects.\n\nInterpretation: Targeted interventions significantly improve endothelial function in SV-CHD patients, suggesting potential benefits in clinical outcomes. Further research is needed to explore long-term effects and optimize treatment strategies.\n\nTrial registration: NCT12345678\n\nFunding: This study was funded by the National Institutes of Health.",
