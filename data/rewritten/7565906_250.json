Patients were randomly assigned to receive dobutamine to increase cardiac index or phenylephrine to increase mean arterial pressure (MAP), with a >10% increase targeted for each. The primary outcome was the absolute change in graft flow between the reference and intervention phases. Randomisation was performed using sealed opaque envelopes, and the anaesthesiologist was blinded to graft flow measurements.\n\nResults: Graft flow increased with a median of 4.1 ml/min (IQR, 1.7–12.0) after dobutamine and 3.6 ml/min (IQR, 1.3–7.8) after phenylephrine (difference –0.6 ml/min; 95% CI, –14.5 to 5.3; P = 0.441). No treatment effect (0.9 ml/min; 95% CI, 0.0–20.1; P = 0.944) or carry-over effect was observed. One patient experienced a short episode of atrial arrhythmia during dobutamine administration, with no haemodynamic consequences.\n\nInterpretation: Both dobutamine and phenylephrine increased graft flow during cerebral bypass surgery, with no preference for one method over the other.\n\nTrial registration: Netherlands Trial Register, NL7077.\n\nFunding: Departmental sources.",
