A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Chewing Gum for Postoperative Recovery after Colorectal Resection\n\nBackground: This randomised controlled trial aimed to determine whether chewing gum reduces the length of hospital stay (LOS) after colorectal resection. Secondary objectives included examining bowel habit symptoms, complications, and healthcare costs.\n\nMethods: Participants were recruited from five UK hospitals between October 2010 and April 2013. Eligible patients were adults scheduled for elective colorectal resection. Participants were randomised 1:1 to standard postoperative care with or without chewing gum (sugar-free gum for at least 10 minutes, four times per day on days 1–5). Randomisation was computer-generated with concealed allocation. The primary outcome was LOS, measured from the date of operation to discharge. Blinding was not feasible for participants or outcome assessors.\n\nResults: A total of 402 patients were analysed (199 in the gum group, 203 in the control group) using an intention-to-treat approach. Median LOS was 7 days in both groups (hazard ratio 0.94, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.15; p = 0.557). Participants in the gum group had worse quality of life at 6 and 12 weeks post-operation and more complications graded III or above (16 vs. 6) and deaths (11 vs. 0), none related to gum. \n\nInterpretation: Chewing gum did not affect bowel function return or LOS after colorectal resection.
