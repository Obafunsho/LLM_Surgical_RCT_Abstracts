Participants were randomised to receive either iNPWT or sterile gauze dressings. The primary outcome was the incidence of SSIs within 30 days, measured using the ASEPSIS scoring protocol. Secondary outcomes included Wound Quality of Life and EQ-5D-3L™ scores. Randomisation was performed using an online system with a block size of ten, and surgeons were blinded to the dressing type. The study recruited 123 patients between 2018 and 2023.\n\nResults: Of the 123 patients randomised, 109 completed the study. SSIs occurred in 15% of the iNPWT group and 25% of the control group (P = 0.340). Patients with a BMI ≥ 25 kg/m² had higher SSI rates. Wound Quality of Life scores were similar between groups, but the iNPWT group reported a larger negative impact on everyday life (7.40 vs. 4.91; P = 0.048). No significant differences were found in EQ-5D-3L™ scores. Adverse events related to the device led to withdrawal in 7 patients. The analysis was per-protocol.\n\nInterpretation: The similar SSI rates and negative impact on everyday life do not support the general use of iNPWT in this patient cohort. However, iNPWT may be beneficial for patients with high BMI and excessive perioperative bleeding, which are associated with higher SSI risk.\n\nTrial registration: NCT03395613\n\nFunding: Not specified.",
