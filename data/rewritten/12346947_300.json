A 300-word version\n\nTitle: A Randomised Controlled Trial of the AtriClip V-Clip for Left Atrial Appendage Exclusion\n\nBackground: Cardiac surgery patients with atrial fibrillation are at increased risk for thromboembolic stroke due to left atrial appendage (LAA) thrombus. Complete surgical LAA exclusion (LAAE) is essential to prevent thrombus formation.\n\nMethods: This retrospective-prospective, multi-center, post-market study (NCT05101993) evaluated the long-term safety and performance of the epicardial V-shape AtriClip device. Patients aged ≥18 years who received V-shape AtriClip devices during non-emergent cardiac surgery were included. The primary performance outcome was LAAE without residual left atrium-LAA communication, assessed by imaging at the last follow-up visit. The primary safety outcome was device- or implant procedure-related serious adverse events (SAEs) within 30 days. Randomisation was conducted by providing a de-identified list of potential patients, which was then randomized and returned to the site for screening. The study was unblinded.\n\nResults: A total of 156 patients were enrolled from 11 U.S. centers between January 2022 and November 2022. Of these, 155 patients were included in the intention-to-treat analysis, and 151 had evaluable imaging. Complete LAAE was achieved in all patients. Primary performance in the intent-to-treat population was met, with 97% (95% CI 93.52%, 99.29%; p = 0.0001) complete LAAE. Primary safety was met, with 100% (95% CI 97.75%, 100%; p < 0.0001) of patients free from pre-defined SAEs within 30 days. One device-related SAE was reported, which resolved intraprocedurally.\n\nInterpretation: The AtriClip V-Clip demonstrated safe and effective LAAE through 12 months of follow-up. The study was funded by AtriCure, Inc. The results support the use of the AtriClip V-Clip as a standard adjunct during cardiac surgery for patients with atrial fibrillation.",
