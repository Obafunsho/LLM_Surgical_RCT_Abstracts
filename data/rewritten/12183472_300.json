A 300-word version\n\nBackground: Necrotizing soft tissue infection (NSTI) is a rare but life-threatening condition characterized by rapid necrosis of skin, subcutaneous tissue, fascia, and muscle. This study aimed to explore the clinical presentation and outcomes of NSTI in patients with advanced malignancies, focusing on diagnostic challenges and management strategies.\n\nMethods: This was a case report involving an 80-year-old female with advanced myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) who developed atraumatic NSTI of the left lower extremity. Blood cultures were obtained, and the patient was monitored for clinical progression. No randomization, blinding, or sample size calculation was applicable as this was a single case report.\n\nResults: Blood cultures revealed Clostridium septicum and Staphylococcus epidermidis, the latter considered a contaminant. The patient rapidly progressed to septic shock and died within 34 hours of presentation. The primary outcome was the time to progression to septic shock, measured from the onset of symptoms. The rapid progression in this case highlights the challenges in diagnosing NSTI, especially in the context of hematologic malignancies like MDS.\n\nInterpretation: This case underscores the need for a high index of suspicion for NSTI in patients with advanced malignancies, particularly when presenting with atypical symptoms. Early recognition and intervention are crucial to improving outcomes. The rapid progression in this case highlights the challenges in diagnosing NSTI, especially in the context of hematologic malignancies like MDS. The findings emphasize the importance of maintaining vigilance for NSTI in high-risk patients and the need for timely surgical intervention and broad-spectrum antibiotics. Further research is needed to better understand the pathophysiology and optimal management strategies for NSTI in patients with hematologic malignancies.",
