This study aimed to evaluate the safety and noninferiority of a minimally invasive percutaneous IPD compared to standalone decompressive surgery (SDS).\n\nMethods: This multicenter, international, open-label, randomised controlled trial enrolled 163 patients from 19 sites across 10 countries between January 2010 and April 2014. Participants were randomised 1:1 to IPD or SDS, with randomisation implemented via an electronic data capture system using blinded blocks. The primary outcome was the mean percentage change in Zurich Claudication Questionnaire (ZCQ) physical function from baseline to 12 months. The study was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT00905359) and funded by Medtronic Spinal and Biologics.\n\nResults: At 12 months, both groups showed significant improvement in ZCQ physical function (IPD: −32.3 ± 32.1, SDS: −37.5 ± 22.8, both P < .001). IPD was not significantly noninferior to SDS at 12 months (P = .172) but was at 24 months (P = .005). Reoperations occurred in 18.2% of IPD and 9.3% of SDS patients. Adverse events were similar between groups, with 33.8% of IPD and 33.3% of SDS patients experiencing at least one serious adverse event.\n\nInterpretation: IPD and SDS achieved similar symptom relief in selected patients, but IPD had a higher reoperation rate. The study confirms findings from three recent RCTs, suggesting IPDs may be a less invasive alternative to open decompression in specific patient subsets. However, the higher reoperation rate remains a concern.",
