A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Albuterol Spray in COPD Patients Undergoing General Anesthesia\n\nBackground: Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are at increased risk of perioperative pulmonary complications. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of albuterol spray on hypoxia and bronchospasm in COPD patients under general anesthesia.\n\nMethods: This single-center, double-blind, parallel-group, randomized controlled trial was conducted at 5 Azar Educational Hospital, Gorgan, Iran, in 2021. A total of 120 smoking patients with COPD, aged 18-65 years, were randomly assigned to receive either albuterol spray (n=60) or placebo (n=60) 20 minutes before anesthesia and after surgery before extubation. The primary outcome was the occurrence of wheezing and bronchospasm, assessed perioperatively. Randomization was performed using block randomization, and allocation was concealed using sequentially numbered, opaque, sealed envelopes. Both patients and outcome assessors were blinded.\n\nResults: The mean age was 52 years, with 115 males. Wheezing and recurrent cough were significantly lower in the albuterol group compared to the control group (p<0.05). The mean arterial oxygen saturation before extubation was significantly higher in the albuterol group (p=0.03). No significant side effects were reported in the albuterol group.\n\nInterpretation: Prophylactic use of albuterol spray reduces wheezing and recurrent cough in COPD patients undergoing general anesthesia.
