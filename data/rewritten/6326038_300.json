A 300-word version\n\nTitle: High-Quality Implementation of the Surgical Safety Checklist: A Stepped Wedge Cluster Randomised Controlled Trial\n\nBackground: This study investigates the effect of high-quality implementation of the World Health Organization's Surgical Safety Checklist (SSC) on care processes and patient outcomes in two Norwegian hospitals.\n\nMethods: Conducted from 2009 to 2010, this stepped wedge cluster randomised controlled trial involved five surgical specialties. The unit of randomisation was surgical specialties, with a sample size calculation requiring at least 1100 patients per group. Participants included patients undergoing orthopedic, cardiothoracic, and neurosurgical procedures. The intervention was the SSC, and the comparator was standard care. The primary outcome was in-hospital complications, measured over a 3-month period post-intervention. Randomisation was achieved through a draw of numbers, with allocation concealment by blinding the allocation assessor. Outcome assessors were blinded.\n\nResults: A total of 3702 procedures were analysed (1398 control, 2304 intervention). High-quality SSC implementation improved care processes, with forced air warming blanket use increasing from 35.3% to 42.4% (p < 0.001) and surgical infections decreasing from 7.4% to 3.6% (p < 0.001). The odds ratio for surgical infections was 0.52 (95% CI: 0.38–0.72) for intervention procedures. Blood transfusion costs were reduced by 40%. No adverse events were reported.\n\nInterpretation: High-quality SSC implementation significantly improved care processes and reduced complications. The study highlights the importance of fidelity in SSC application to achieve clinical effectiveness. Trial registration: Unique identifier 2009/561. Funding: Not specified.",
