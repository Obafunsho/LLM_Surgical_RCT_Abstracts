A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Lateral Lymph Node Involvement in Rectal Cancer\n\nBackground: The role of enlarged lateral lymph nodes (LLN) in rectal cancer recurrence, metastasis, and organ preservation is controversial. This study assesses LLN involvement in rectal adenocarcinoma patients.\n\nMethods: A post hoc analysis of the OPRA trial, a multicenter randomised controlled trial, was conducted. Patients with locally advanced rectal cancer were treated with total neoadjuvant therapy (TNT) followed by total mesorectal excision or watch-and-wait management. Eligibility criteria included rectal cancer with LLN involvement. The primary outcome was disease recurrence, assessed over a follow-up period. Randomisation was centralised, with allocation concealment. Blinding details were not provided.\n\nResults: Of 324 patients, 57 (18%) had visible LLN (LLN+) on baseline MRI. Post-TNT, LLN disappeared in 30 (53%) of these patients. Disease recurrence in LLN was rare, occurring in 3.5% of LLN+ and 0.4% of LLN− patients. All patients with LLN recurrence also had distant metastasis. Organ preservation was significantly lower in patients with LLN ≥ 4 mm on restaging MRI (P = 0.013). No significant differences in local recurrence or metastasis rates were observed between LLN+ vs. LLN− and LLN ≥ 7 mm vs. < 7 mm on baseline MRI. LLN dissection was performed in 3 patients; 2 died of distant metastasis. Adverse events were not reported.\n\nInterpretation: LLN involvement does not correlate with increased recurrence or metastasis, but persistence of LLN ≥ 4 mm post-TNT is negatively associated with rectum preservation. LLN dissection appears to benefit few patients. Trial registration: [Number]. Funding: [Source]. Further research is needed to refine treatment strategies for LLN in rectal cancer.",
