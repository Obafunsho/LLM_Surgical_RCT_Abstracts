Eligibility criteria included age over 18 and absence of pre-existing chronic kidney disease. Participants were randomized using a computer-generated sequence, with allocation concealment ensured by sealed envelopes. The intervention group received biomarker-guided management, while the control group received standard care. The primary outcome was the incidence of AKI within 48 hours, measured by serum creatinine levels. Blinding was maintained for outcome assessors, patients, and clinicians.\n\nResults: A total of 200 participants were randomized, with 100 in each group, between January 2020 and June 2021. Analysis was conducted on 98 participants in the intervention group and 97 in the control group using an intention-to-treat approach. The intervention group demonstrated a significant reduction in AKI incidence compared to the control group (mean difference = 5.2%, 95% CI 3.1 to 7.3; p = 0.01). Adverse events were reported in 3% of the intervention group and 1% of the control group, with mild gastrointestinal side effects being the most common.\n\nInterpretation: The findings suggest that biomarker-guided management significantly reduces the incidence of AKI compared to standard care, indicating potential for improved patient outcomes and highlighting the importance of early intervention in high-risk patients.\n\nTrial registration: NCT12345678.\n\nFunding: This trial was funded by the National Institutes of Health.",
