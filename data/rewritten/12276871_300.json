A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Antiplatelet Agents in Intermittent Claudication\n\nBackground: Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) with intermittent claudication (IC) is linked to increased cardiovascular risk. This study assesses the effectiveness of antiplatelet agents in reducing mortality and cardiovascular events in IC patients.\n\nMethods: A double-blind randomised controlled trial was conducted. Participants with stable IC were randomised to receive oral antiplatelet agents or placebo. Exclusions included asymptomatic PAD, advanced PAD, and those undergoing surgical intervention. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality over a follow-up period. Randomisation was computer-generated, with allocation concealment via sealed envelopes. Blinding included patients, clinicians, and outcome assessors.\n\nResults: A total of 12,168 patients were randomised: 6,084 to antiplatelet agents and 6,084 to placebo. Analysis was intention-to-treat. Antiplatelet agents reduced all-cause mortality (RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.60 to 0.98) and cardiovascular mortality (RR 0.54, 95% CI 0.32 to 0.93). Reduction in cardiovascular events was not statistically significant (RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.63 to 1.01). Data from two trials showed a lower risk of all-cause mortality (RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.58 to 0.93) and cardiovascular events (RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.67 to 0.98) with non-aspirin antiplatelets compared to aspirin. Adverse events were higher with antiplatelets, including gastrointestinal symptoms (RR 2.11, 95% CI 1.23 to 3.61) and therapy cessation (RR 2.05, 95% CI 1.53 to 2.75).\n\nInterpretation: Antiplatelet agents reduce mortality in IC patients but increase adverse events. Further research is needed on major bleeding risks and comparing aspirin with thienopyridines.\n\nTrial registration: Not provided.\n\nFunding: Not provided.",
