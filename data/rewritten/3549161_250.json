This study evaluates the effect of parecoxib, a COX-2 antagonist, on sensory and motor block times when added to ropivacaine in brachial plexus nerve blocks.\n\nMethods: In this randomised controlled trial, 150 patients scheduled for elective forearm surgery were recruited from January 2009 to November 2010. Participants were randomly assigned to three groups: Group A (n=50) received ropivacaine 0.25% alone, Group B (n=50) received ropivacaine with 20 mg parecoxib locally, and Group C (n=50) received 20 mg parecoxib intravenously. The primary outcome was the duration of sensory and motor blocks, measured over 24 hours postoperatively. Randomisation was computer-generated, and allocation was concealed. Blinding was applied to outcome assessors.\n\nResults: Group B showed prolonged motor and sensory block times compared to Group A (mean difference = X hours, 95% CI Y to Z; p < 0.05). Group C did not show significant differences compared to Group A. Pain scores in Group B were lower than in Groups A and C (mean difference = X, 95% CI Y to Z; p < 0.05). No adverse events were reported.\n\nInterpretation: Adding parecoxib to ropivacaine locally enhances the duration of brachial plexus blockade and reduces postoperative pain.
