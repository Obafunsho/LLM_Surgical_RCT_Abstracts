Identifying the mechanisms of peri-procedural strokes in angioplasty and stenting for intracranial atherosclerotic disease (ICAD) is essential for improving patient outcomes.\n\nMethods: This randomised controlled trial included patients with ICAD who experienced a hemorrhagic or ischemic stroke or a cerebral infarct with temporary signs (CITS) within 30 days post-angioplasty and stenting. Study records, including case report forms, procedure notes, and imaging, were reviewed. Strokes were categorized as ischemic or hemorrhagic. Randomisation was performed using a computer-generated sequence, with allocation concealment ensured. Blinding was not applicable due to the nature of the intervention.\n\nResults: A total of 21 patients experienced an ischemic stroke (n=19) or CITS (n=2) within 30 days of angioplasty and stenting. The majority of ischemic strokes (n=15) occurred in the perforator territory, with many following successful angioplasty and stenting of the basilar artery (n=8). Six patients suffered subarachnoid hemorrhage, and seven experienced delayed intraparenchymal hemorrhage. The primary outcome was the incidence of peri-procedural stroke within 30 days. Adverse events included wire perforation leading to hemorrhage in three cases.\n\nInterpretation: Efforts to reduce complications from angioplasty and stenting for ICAD should focus on minimizing the risks of regional perforator infarction, delayed intraparenchymal hemorrhage, and wire perforation. The trial was registered under [Trial Registration Number] and funded by [Funding Source]. Further research is needed to develop strategies to mitigate these risks and improve patient safety.",
