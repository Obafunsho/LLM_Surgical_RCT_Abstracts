This study evaluates the efficacy of the Cox-Maze IV procedure and left atrial appendage (LAA) occlusion in patients with AF.\n\nMethods: This randomised controlled trial was conducted in Brazil, enrolling patients with symptomatic AF refractory to antiarrhythmic drugs or catheter ablation. Participants were randomised to receive either the Cox-Maze IV procedure with LAA occlusion or standard medical therapy. The primary outcome was freedom from AF at 12 months. Randomisation was computer-generated, and allocation was concealed. Blinding was applied to outcome assessors.\n\nResults: A total of 200 participants were randomised: 100 to the intervention group and 100 to the control group, between January 2020 and June 2021. In the intervention group, 98 participants were analysed using an intention-to-treat approach, while 97 were analysed in the control group. The intervention group showed a 92% AF freedom rate at 12 months compared to 0% in the control group (p < 0.001). Adverse events included renal dysfunction and pacemaker requirement in <5% of the intervention group, with no increase in overall mortality.\n\nInterpretation: The Cox-Maze IV procedure with LAA occlusion significantly improves AF outcomes compared to standard therapy, with manageable adverse events.
