A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Prehabilitation in Surgical Patients\n\nBackground: This randomised controlled trial assessed the efficacy of prehabilitation in enhancing surgical outcomes. Prehabilitation involves exercise, nutrition, respiratory training, and psychosocial support to optimize patients' preoperative condition.\n\nMethods: Participants were randomized into intervention and control groups, with a sample size calculated to detect significant differences in postoperative outcomes. Eligibility criteria included adults scheduled for surgery, conducted in a hospital setting. The intervention group received a multimodal prehabilitation program, while the control group received standard care. The primary outcome was the rate of postoperative complications, measured within 30 days post-surgery. Randomisation was computer-generated, with allocation concealment using sealed envelopes. Outcome assessors were blinded to group allocation.\n\nResults: A total of 200 participants were randomised: 100 to the intervention and 100 to the control group, recruited between January 2020 and June 2021. Analysis included 98 participants in the intervention group and 97 in the control group, using an intention-to-treat approach. The intervention group demonstrated a significant reduction in complications (mean difference = 5.2%, 95% CI 3.1 to 7.3; p = 0.01). Adverse events were mild, with 3% in the intervention and 1% in the control group experiencing gastrointestinal side-effects.\n\nInterpretation: The trial demonstrated that prehabilitation significantly improves surgical outcomes, supporting its integration into routine preoperative care. The findings suggest that prehabilitation can enhance patient resilience and recovery, with potential applicability across various surgical specialties. Further research is warranted to explore its effectiveness in different surgical contexts and to optimize multimodal strategies.\n\nTrial registration: NCT12345678\n\nFunding: This trial was funded by the National Institute of Health.",
