  "abstract": "Title: Randomised Controlled Trial on the Effect of Sugammadex on Acute Hypoxic Ventilatory Response Recovery\n\nBackground: Neuromuscular blocking agents can inhibit the peripheral chemoreflex, increasing the risk of postoperative respiratory complications. This study evaluated the effect of 2 and 4 mg/kg sugammadex versus spontaneous recovery on the acute hypoxic ventilatory response (AHVR) after minimal neuromuscular block.\n\nMethods: Conducted at Leiden University Medical Center from January 2022 to July 2023, this single-center, single-blind, two-experiment randomized controlled trial included healthy volunteers aged 18 years or older. Participants received a continuous infusion of rocuronium to induce symptomatic neuromuscular block. In experiment 1, block recovery was spontaneous, while in experiment 2, participants were randomized to receive 2 mg/kg or 4 mg/kg sugammadex. Randomization was computer-generated, and only participants were blinded. The primary outcome was AHVR recovery time, measured at baseline, during block, and at 0, 20, and 40 minutes post-recovery.\n\nResults: Thirty-two participants were randomized, with 14 in experiment 1 and 18 in experiment 2 analyzed per protocol. AHVR was reduced by 32% during block (mean TOF ratio 0.42 ± 0.22). At symptom resolution, AHVR remained 23% below baseline. In 57% of spontaneous recovery versus 28% of sugammadex groups, AHVR did not return to baseline. No significant adverse events were reported. Trial registration: NCT05149872. Funding: Merck Sharp & Dohme LLC.\n\nInterpretation: Sugammadex did not significantly alter AHVR recovery compared to spontaneous recovery, but fewer participants had residual AHVR depression with sugammadex. These findings suggest sugammadex may facilitate faster AHVR recovery, warranting further clinical investigation.",
