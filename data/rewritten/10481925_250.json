A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Indocyanine Green Fluorescence Imaging in Minimally Invasive Rectal Cancer Surgery\n\nBackground: The efficacy of indocyanine green fluorescence imaging (ICG-FI) in reducing anastomotic leakage in minimally invasive rectal cancer surgery is debated.\n\nMethods: This open-label, phase III randomised controlled trial was conducted at 41 hospitals in Japan. Patients with stage 0–III rectal carcinoma less than 12 cm from the anal verge, scheduled for minimally invasive sphincter-preserving surgery, were randomised 1:1 to receive ICG-FI (ICG+ group) or no ICG-FI (ICG− group). The primary outcome was the anastomotic leakage rate (grade A+B+C) within 30 days post-surgery. Randomisation was computerised, and allocation was not concealed. Neither patients nor clinicians were blinded. Sample size was calculated to detect a 6% reduction in leakage rate, requiring 391 participants per group.\n\nResults: Between December 2018 and February 2021, 850 patients were randomised (422 to ICG+ and 417 to ICG−). The modified intention-to-treat analysis included 839 patients. The anastomotic leakage rate was 7.6% in the ICG+ group versus 11.8% in the ICG− group (relative risk 0.645; 95% CI 0.422–0.987; p = 0.041). Reoperation rates were 0.5% in the ICG+ group and 2.4% in the ICG− group (p = 0.021). No adverse events related to ICG were reported.\n\nInterpretation: ICG-FI significantly reduced the anastomotic leakage rate by 4.2%, although the reduction was less than the expected 6%.
