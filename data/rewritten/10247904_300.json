A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Tricuspid Annuloplasty During Mitral Valve Surgery\n\nBackground: This study investigates the effects of tricuspid annuloplasty (TA) during mitral valve surgery (MVS) for degenerative mitral regurgitation (MR) with moderate or less tricuspid regurgitation (TR) on permanent pacemaker (PPM) implantation rates.\n\nMethods: In a multicenter, randomised controlled trial, 401 patients were randomised to MVS alone (n=203) or MVS with TA (n=198). The primary outcome was the composite rate of death, re-operation for TR, or TR progression at 2 years. Randomisation was computer-generated, and allocation was concealed. Blinding was not specified. Potential risk factors for PPMs were assessed using multivariable time-to-event models with death and PPM implantation for heart failure indications as competing risks.\n\nResults: A PPM was implanted in 36 patients (9.6%; 95% CI 6.8%−13.0%) within 2 years, with 30/187 (16.0%) in the MVS+TA group and 6/188 (3.2%) in the MVS group (RR 5.08; 95% CI 2.16–11.94; p<0.001). The majority (80.6%) of implants occurred within 30 days postoperatively. Independent risk factors for PPMs were TA (HR 5.94; 95% CI 2.27–15.53; p<0.001), increasing age (HR 1.23; 95% CI 1.01–1.52; p=0.04), and LVEF (HR 0.96; 95% CI 0.92–0.99; p=0.02). In the TA group, age and LVEF were associated with PPM within 2 years.\n\nInterpretation: While TA during MVS effectively prevents TR progression, it significantly increases the risk of PPM implantation. Strategies to reduce this risk are necessary.\n\nTrial registration: [Trial registration number]\n\nFunding: [Source of funding]",
