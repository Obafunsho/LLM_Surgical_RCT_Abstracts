A 300-word version\n\nTitle: CETUPANC Trial: A Randomised Controlled Trial Comparing Surgical Approaches in Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma\n\nBackground: This randomised controlled trial evaluated the impact of the no-touch (NT) approach versus the superior mesenteric artery (SMA) approach in pancreatoduodenectomy on intraoperative circulating tumour cells (CTCs) and cluster mobilization, and their potential link to distant metastasis.\n\nMethods: Conducted across ten university hospitals, the trial included patients with resectable pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Participants were randomly assigned to either the NT or SMA group. The primary outcome was intraoperative CTC and cluster mobilization, assessed at four time points. Randomization was intraoperative, with allocation concealed until surgery. Patients were blinded to the intervention. A total of 101 patients were randomized (51 SMA, 50 NT) between January 2017 and December 2019. Sixty-three patients with PDAC were analyzed using an intention-to-treat approach.\n\nResults: CTC and cluster mobilization were comparable between the NT and SMA groups. Median metastasis disease-free survival (MDFS) was 12 months (IQR 6.1–not reached) in the SMA group and 18 months (IQR 12.1–not reached) in the NT group (P = 0.730). High intraoperative cluster dissemination was significantly associated with early metastases within the first year post-surgery (P = 0.023). The SMA approach (P = 0.025) and vein resection (P < 0.001) were identified as predictive factors for cluster mobilization. No adverse events were reported.\n\nInterpretation: The NT and SMA approaches resulted in similar CTC and cluster mobilization and survival outcomes. However, high intraoperative cluster dissemination was a predictive factor for early metastases in PDAC patients, suggesting the need for tailored postoperative management.\n\nTrial registration: NCT03340844.
