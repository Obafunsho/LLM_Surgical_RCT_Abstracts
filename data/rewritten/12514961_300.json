The primary outcome was opioid consumption within 72 hours postoperatively. Secondary outcomes included pain ratings at various time points, rescue analgesia, time to first ambulation and defecation, and adverse events. Randomization was achieved using fixed block randomization with allocation concealment via sealed opaque envelopes. Blinding was maintained for participants, clinicians, and outcome assessors.\n\nResults: From November 1, 2024, to March 10, 2025, 102 patients were randomized (LB group, n = 51; RH group, n = 51). One patient was excluded, resulting in 101 patients analyzed. LB significantly reduced 72-hour opioid consumption compared to RH (mean difference = –181.4 mg; 95% CI: –232.8, –130.0 mg; P < 0.001). Fewer patients in the LB group required rescue analgesia (OR: 0.33; 95% CI: 0.13, 0.82; P = 0.015). Pain scores at 24 hours were lower in the LB group (difference = –0.44; 95% CI: –0.84, –0.04; P = 0.032). No significant differences in adverse events were observed between groups.\n\nInterpretation: LB in thoracic paravertebral block effectively reduces opioid consumption and enhances recovery without increasing adverse events.
