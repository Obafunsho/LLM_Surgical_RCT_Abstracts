A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of ABThera vs. Barker's Vacuum Pack in Reducing Systemic Inflammation\n\nBackground: Excessive systemic inflammation following abdominal injury or intra-abdominal sepsis is associated with poor outcomes. This study aimed to evaluate whether the ABThera temporary abdominal closure device reduces systemic inflammation compared to Barker's vacuum pack.\n\nMethods: This single-center, parallel-group randomised controlled trial was conducted at Foothills Medical Centre, Calgary, Canada. Forty-five adults undergoing abbreviated laparotomy were randomised 1:1 to ABThera (n=23) or Barker's vacuum pack (n=22) between September 29, 2011, and December 9, 2012. The primary outcome was the difference in plasma IL-6 concentration at 24 and 48 hours post-application. Randomisation was computer-generated with allocation concealment via a dedicated website. Outcome assessors were blinded. Analysis was conducted using intention-to-treat principles.\n\nResults: There was no significant difference in plasma IL-6 concentrations at 24 (p=0.52) or 48 hours (p=0.82) between groups. The 90-day mortality was lower in the ABThera group (HR 0.32, 95% CI 0.11–0.93, p=0.04). The cumulative incidence of primary fascial closure at 90 days was similar between groups (HR 1.6, 95% CI 0.82–3.0, p=0.17). No significant differences were observed in adverse events, including enterocutaneous fistula formation and intra-abdominal hypertension.\n\nInterpretation: The ABThera device was associated with improved 90-day survival but did not significantly affect systemic inflammation markers or adverse events compared to Barker's vacuum pack. These findings suggest potential benefits of ABThera in improving survival, warranting further multicenter trials to confirm these results and explore underlying mechanisms.\n\nTrial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01355094.\n\nFunding: The trial was funded by institutional grants.",
