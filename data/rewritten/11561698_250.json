A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial on the Effects of Hydroxyethyl Starches on Kidney Function\n\nBackground: Hydroxyethyl starches (HES) are synthetic colloids used for fluid resuscitation but have been linked to adverse kidney effects. This study updates a Cochrane review from 2010.\n\nMethods: We conducted a randomised controlled trial comparing HES to other fluid therapies. The unit of randomisation was individual patients, with a sample size of 11,399 across 42 studies. Eligibility criteria included patients requiring fluid resuscitation. The primary outcome was renal replacement therapy (RRT) and acute kidney injury (AKI) over a follow-up period defined by the RIFLE criteria. Randomisation and allocation concealment methods were not specified. Blinding details were not provided.\n\nResults: A total of 11,399 patients were randomised, with 9,857 analysed for RRT and 8,402 for AKI. HES increased the risk of RRT (RR 1.31, 95% CI 1.16 to 1.49) and AKI (RR 1.14, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.30). Adverse events were not detailed.\n\nInterpretation: HES products increase the risk of AKI and RRT. The risks likely outweigh benefits, suggesting alternative therapies should be considered. Trial registration and funding sources were not reported.",
