A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Trimodality Therapy in Superior Sulcus Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer\n\nBackground: Preoperative chemotherapy and radiation followed by surgery is standard for superior sulcus (SS) cancers, but relapse limits survival. This trial evaluated the feasibility of adding docetaxel as consolidation therapy.\n\nMethods: In this single-arm trial, patients with T3-T4, N0-N1, M0 SS NSCLC received induction therapy with cisplatin-etoposide and thoracic RT 45 Gy. Non-progressing patients underwent surgical resection within 7 weeks, followed by docetaxel every 3 weeks for 3 doses. The primary objective was feasibility, with a target of 45 eligible patients.\n\nResults: Of 46 registered patients, 44 were eligible; 38 (86%) completed induction, 29 (66%) underwent resection, and 20 (45% of eligible) completed consolidation. Complete resection (R0) was achieved in 28/29 (97%). Two patients (7%) died of ARDS. Pathologic complete or near-complete response was observed in 21/29 (72%) resected patients. Recurrence was local (2), local-systemic (1), and systemic (10), with 7 brain-only. Three-year progression-free survival was 56%, and overall survival was 61%.\n\nInterpretation: Trimodality therapy achieved high R0 resection rates and local control, but only 66% underwent resection and 45% completed treatment. Distant recurrence, especially brain-only, remains a challenge. Future strategies should enhance systemic therapy and reduce brain metastases. The trial was registered under [Trial Registration Number] and funded by [Funding Source].",
