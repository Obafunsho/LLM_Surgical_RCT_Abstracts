A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Evaluation of PERCIST in Predicting Pathologic Response in NSCLC: A Retrospective Study\n\nBackground: Induction therapy followed by surgery is an alternative treatment for locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). This study evaluates the predictive value of Positron Emission Tomography Response Criteria in Solid Tumors (PERCIST) for pathologic response.\n\nMethods: This retrospective study analyzed 130 patients from the Setouchi Lung Cancer Group who underwent FDG-PET imaging before and after induction therapy prior to planned surgical resection for NSCLC between 2007 and 2016. Pathologic responses of primary lung tumors and metastatic lymph nodes were compared with PERCIST evaluations. The primary outcome was pathologic complete response (pCR), measured postoperatively.\n\nResults: Pathologic studies revealed pCR in 42 (32.3%) patients. PERCIST was significantly correlated with pathologic response (p < 0.001). The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of PERCIST for predicting pCR were 16.7%, 88.6%, and 65.4%, respectively. Patients with pCR had significantly higher reduction rates in SULpeak for both primary lung tumors and metastatic lymph nodes and TLG for primary tumors than non-responders. In a multivariate Cox regression analysis, tumor site in upper lobes, reduction rate of TLG in primary tumor, and pathologic N0 were independent predictors of favorable recurrence-free survival (RFS).\n\nInterpretation: PERCIST, particularly the rate of TLG reduction, is useful for predicting pathological response and prognosis after induction therapy in NSCLC. Further research is needed to confirm these findings.",
