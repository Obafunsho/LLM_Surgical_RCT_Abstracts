This study aimed to evaluate the intellectual and conceptual foundations of MRI-based neuroplasticity research in stroke through a bibliometric analysis.\n\nMethods: A comprehensive search of Scopus was conducted for publications from January 2004 to December 2024. Eligible studies included original articles and reviews assessing neuroplasticity in stroke using MRI. Citation Classics were defined as articles with ≥100 citations. Performance indicators were compared using Mann-Whitney U and Chi-square tests. Science mapping was performed with Biblioshiny and VOSviewer.\n\nResults: From 854 initial records, 100 most-cited articles were included, with Citation Classics (n = 62) showing significantly higher mean citation counts and rates per year than non-Classics (p < 0.0001). Reviews predominated among Classics, while original research was more frequent in non-Classics. High-impact journals accounted for the most influential articles, with strong correlations between journal metrics and citation performance. Leading institutions included Harvard Medical School and University of California, Irvine. The United States, Germany, and the United Kingdom dominated global contributions, with emerging participation from China and Japan. Science mapping revealed clusters on motor recovery, cortical reorganization, and emerging areas like connectomics.\n\nInterpretation: This study provides a comprehensive overview of MRI-based neuroplasticity research in stroke, identifying seminal works and evolving research themes. While citation activity has declined, advances in connectomics and computational approaches offer promising directions. Expanding global collaborations and addressing underrepresented regions will be critical for inclusive progress. MRI remains central to bridging mechanistic insights with clinical applications in stroke rehabilitation.",
