Eligibility criteria included patients undergoing the Norwood procedure. Participants were randomised to receive either a modified Blalock-Taussig shunt or a right ventricle-to-pulmonary artery shunt. The primary outcome was hospital length of stay (LOS) at the stage II procedure, measured in days. Randomisation was performed using a computer-generated sequence, with allocation concealment ensured by sealed envelopes. Due to the nature of the intervention, blinding was not feasible.\n\nResults: A total of 393 participants were randomised, with 196 allocated to the modified Blalock-Taussig shunt and 197 to the right ventricle-to-pulmonary artery shunt. The median stage II procedure hospital LOS was 8 days (IQR 6, 14), with no significant difference between shunt types. Hospital mortality was 4.3%, and transplantation occurred in 0.8% of cases. Longer LOS was associated with center, longer post-Norwood LOS (HR 1.93 per log day, P<0.001), non-elective timing of the stage II procedure (HR 1.78, P<0.001), and pulmonary artery stenosis (HR 1.56, P<0.001). Non-elective stage II, moderate or greater atrioventricular valve regurgitation, and atrioventricular valve repair were risk factors for in-hospital death. Adverse events were not significantly different between groups.\n\nInterpretation: Shunt type did not significantly affect stage II hospital LOS. Factors such as Norwood LOS, pulmonary artery stenosis, and non-elective stage II procedure were associated with longer LOS. The trial was registered under [Trial Registration Number].
