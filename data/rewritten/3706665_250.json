A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Volar Locking Plate Fixation in Low-Grade Open vs. Closed Distal Radius Fractures\n\nBackground: This study aimed to compare the outcomes of volar locking plate fixation in low-grade open distal radius fractures (DRFs) versus closed DRFs.\n\nMethods: This randomised controlled trial included 60 participants, with 20 patients in the open fracture group and 40 in the closed fracture group. Participants were treated at a single orthopedic center. Eligibility criteria included patients with Gustilo and Anderson Type I or II open DRFs. The primary outcome was the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand (DASH) score, measured at 3 months and 1 year postoperatively. Randomisation was performed using a computer-generated sequence, and allocation was concealed. Blinding was not applicable due to the nature of the intervention.\n\nResults: At 3 months, the closed fracture group showed better wrist flexion, extension, grip strength, and DASH scores. However, at 1 year, no significant differences were observed between the groups in functional outcomes. Radiographic parameters and infection rates were similar between groups. No severe adverse events were reported.\n\nInterpretation: Volar locking plate fixation in low-grade open DRFs results in comparable 1-year outcomes to closed DRFs, despite initial differences at 3 months. This suggests that volar plate fixation is a viable option for low-grade open DRFs.\n\nTrial registration: Not provided.\n\nFunding: Not disclosed.",
