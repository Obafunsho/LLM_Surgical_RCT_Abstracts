One knee was operated on using computer navigation, and the other without. Eligibility criteria included patients scheduled for bilateral TKA. The primary outcome was the Knee Society knee score, measured at a mean follow-up of 15 years. Randomisation was performed at the knee level, and allocation was concealed. Both patients and assessors were blinded to treatment assignment. A total of 282 patients (95%) were analysed using an intention-to-treat approach.\n\nResults: No significant differences were found between the computer-assisted and conventional TKA groups in Knee Society knee scores (92 ± 8 vs. 93 ± 7; p = 0.461), function scores, WOMAC scores, or radiographic alignment. The Kaplan-Meier survivorship was 99% in both groups at 15 years. Anterior femoral notching occurred in 11 knees (4%) in the computer-assisted group and none in the conventional group (p = 0.046).\n\nInterpretation: Computer-assisted TKA did not demonstrate superior outcomes in pain, function, or survivorship compared to conventional TKA. Given the risks and costs associated with computer navigation, its widespread use is not recommended without further evidence of long-term benefits.\n\nTrial registration: Not provided.\n\nFunding: Not provided.",
