A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Opioid-Sparing Anesthesia in Laparoscopic Major Abdominal Surgery\n\nBackground: Opioid-sparing (OS) anesthesia strategies have been proposed to enhance postoperative recovery, but their benefits in laparoscopic major abdominal surgery remain unclear.\n\nMethods: This double-blind, randomised controlled trial was conducted at a single center from May 2022 to August 2023. Eligible participants were adults aged 18-65 years undergoing laparoscopic major abdominal surgery. Participants were randomly assigned to receive either remifentanil (Remi group, n=77) or esketamine combined with dexmedetomidine (OS group, n=80). The primary outcome was the numeric rating scale (NRS) pain score on postoperative day (POD)1. Randomisation was performed using a computer-generated list, and allocation was concealed with opaque envelopes. Patients, clinicians, and outcome assessors were blinded.\n\nResults: In the postanesthesia care unit (PACU), the OS group had significantly lower NRS pain scores and a lower proportion of rescue analgesia compared to the Remi group (NRS: 1 vs 3, p=0.001; rescue analgesia: 5.0% vs 15.6%, p=0.028). Extubation time was longer in the OS group (31 vs 20 minutes, p<0.01), and the proportion of dreaminess was higher (42.5% vs 15.6%, p<0.01). No significant differences were observed in NRS scores on POD1, POD7, and POD30, or in the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index on POD30. The analysis was conducted on 157 patients using an intention-to-treat approach.\n\nInterpretation: OS anesthesia with esketamine and dexmedetomidine reduces PACU pain scores and rescue analgesia use but may prolong extubation time and increase dreaminess. The findings suggest that this OS strategy is effective in managing postoperative pain but requires careful monitoring for potential side effects. Trial Registration: ChiCTR2200060130.
