Randomisation was conducted using a computer-generated sequence, with allocation concealment ensured through sealed envelopes. IORA was administered as a bolus injection into a tibial intraosseous cannula below an inflated thigh tourniquet immediately before skin incision. Subcutaneous fat and bone samples were collected intraoperatively to measure vancomycin concentrations. The primary outcome was the tissue concentration of vancomycin, assessed during the procedure.\n\nResults: The mean vancomycin concentration in subcutaneous fat was 14 μg/g in the 250-mg IORA group, 44 μg/g in the 500-mg IORA group, and 3.2 μg/g in the systemic group. In bone, concentrations were 16 μg/g, 38 μg/g, and 4.0 μg/g, respectively. One patient in the systemic group experienced red man syndrome. No other adverse events were reported.\n\nInterpretation: Low-dose IORA vancomycin results in tissue concentrations that are equal to or greater than those achieved with systemic administration, potentially reducing systemic side effects while providing effective prophylaxis in TKA.\n\nTrial registration: [Trial registration number]\n\nFunding: [Source of funding]",
