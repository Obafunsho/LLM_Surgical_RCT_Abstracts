A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Liposomal Bupivacaine in Quadratus Lumborum Block for Laparoscopic Nephrectomy\n\nBackground: Quadratus lumborum block at the lateral supra-arcuate ligament (QLB-LSAL) is effective for postoperative pain management in laparoscopic nephrectomy. This trial compared the analgesic efficacy of liposomal bupivacaine versus bupivacaine hydrochloride in QLB-LSAL.\n\nMethods: In this single-center, triple-blind, randomised controlled trial, 116 patients aged 20–75 years undergoing elective laparoscopic nephrectomy were enrolled at Xuzhou Medical University. Participants were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either 10 mL of liposomal bupivacaine (133 mg) with 10 mL saline or 20 mL of 0.375% bupivacaine hydrochloride. The primary outcome was total morphine equivalent consumption within 48 hours postoperatively. Randomisation was computer-generated, with allocation concealed in opaque envelopes. Patients, surgeons, and outcome assessors were blinded. Analysis was intention-to-treat.\n\nResults: Between January and May 2025, 116 patients were randomised: 58 to each group. The liposomal bupivacaine group had significantly lower morphine consumption (mean difference = 11.1 mg, 95% CI 10.1 to 12.1, P < 0.001) and improved recovery quality. No significant difference in adverse events was observed between groups.\n\nInterpretation: Liposomal bupivacaine in QLB-LSAL significantly reduces opioid consumption and enhances recovery quality in laparoscopic nephrectomy.
