A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Intrathecal Oxytocin for Postoperative Recovery: A Randomised Controlled Trial\n\nBackground: Recovery from surgery may be expedited in the postpartum period due to oxytocin's action in the spinal cord. This study evaluated whether intrathecal oxytocin accelerates recovery from pain and disability after major surgery.\n\nMethods: In this randomised controlled trial, 98 participants undergoing elective total hip arthroplasty were randomised to receive either intrathecal oxytocin (100 μg) or saline. The primary outcome was the modelled pain trajectory, assessed from the day of hospital discharge over 8 weeks. Secondary outcomes included opioid use, daily steps, and disability. Randomisation was computer-generated, with allocation concealed. Participants, clinicians, and outcome assessors were blinded. The study was conducted at a single tertiary care center.\n\nResults: Ninety patients were analysed (oxytocin: n=44; saline: n=46) using an intention-to-treat approach. The primary outcome showed no significant difference in pain trajectory between groups (intercept: −0.1, 95% CI: −0.8 to 0.6, p=0.746; slope: 0.1, 95% CI: 0 to 0.2, p=0.057). Secondary analyses indicated earlier cessation of opioid use and increased daily steps in the oxytocin group (p<0.001), with reduced disability for the first 21 days (p=0.007). No drug-related adverse effects were reported.\n\nInterpretation: Intrathecal oxytocin did not significantly alter pain recovery but may enhance functional recovery post-surgery. Further research is warranted.\n\nTrial registration: [Trial registration number]\n\nFunding: The study was stopped early due to lack of funding.",
