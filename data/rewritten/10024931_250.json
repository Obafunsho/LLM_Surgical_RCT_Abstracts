  "abstract": "250-word version:\n\nBackground: Cardiac masses, including myxomas, can cause significant clinical issues. Myxomas are the most common primary cardiac tumors, typically arising from the left heart chambers. Surgical resection is the standard treatment, but it is not always feasible. This study aimed to evaluate the management of a pulmonary valve mass suspicious of being a myxoma in a patient with multiple comorbidities.\n\nMethods: This case study was conducted in a hospital setting. The patient, a 77-year-old male with chronic kidney disease, type 1 diabetes mellitus, and hypertension, presented with a pulmonary valve mass. Due to the patient's poor surgical candidacy, a conservative management approach was adopted.\n\nResults: The patient underwent high-risk staged percutaneous coronary intervention followed by dual antiplatelet therapy. At six months follow-up, the patient showed no complications such as stroke or pulmonary embolism, and the echocardiogram indicated stable mass size and improved ejection fraction.\n\nInterpretation: In patients who are poor surgical candidates, conservative management with antiplatelet therapy may help reduce thromboembolic and constitutional symptoms associated with cardiac myxomas. Further studies are needed to establish guidelines for non-surgical management of cardiac myxomas.",
