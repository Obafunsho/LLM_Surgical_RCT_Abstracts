Participants were randomised to either LR (357) or sublobar resection (SLR) (340), stratified by clinical tumor size, histology, and smoking history. Randomisation was performed using a computer-generated sequence with allocation concealment. The primary outcome was DFS over a five-year period. Blinding was not implemented for outcome assessors, patients, or clinicians.\n\nResults: Of the participants, 362 underwent LR, 131 SR, and 204 WR. Five-year DFS rates were 64.7% for LR, 63.8% for SR, and 62.5% for WR (p = 0.888). Five-year OS rates were 78.7% for LR, 81.9% for SR, and 79.7% for WR (p = 0.873). Five-year LCSS rates were 86.8% for LR, 89.2% for SR, and 89.7% for WR (p = 0.903). Locoregional recurrence was observed in 12% of SR and 14% of WR (p = 0.295). At 6 months postoperatively, the median reduction in % FEV1 was 5% for WR and 3% for SR (p = 0.930). No significant adverse events were reported.\n\nInterpretation: The trial demonstrated that LR, SR, and WR are associated with similar survival outcomes. Differences in locoregional recurrence and FEV1 reduction between SR and WR were not statistically significant.\n\nTrial registration: [Trial registration number]\n\nFunding: [Source of funding]",
