A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of ANP-HA-GNPs for Chemoresistant Retinoblastoma\n\nBackground: Chemoresistant retinoblastoma (RB) poses significant treatment challenges. This study evaluates the efficacy of atrial natriuretic peptide-conjugated hyaluronic acid-coated gold nanoparticles (ANP-HA-GNPs) as an adjuvant therapy for chemoresistant RB.\n\nMethods: This randomised controlled trial was conducted using an in ovo chicken chorioallantoic membrane model and an orthotopic in vivo RB rat eye model. Etoposide-resistant RB cells were treated with ANP-HA-GNPs, with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) as the control. The primary outcome was tumor growth reduction, measured over a 7-day period. Randomisation was performed using a computer-generated sequence, and allocation was concealed using sealed envelopes. Outcome assessors were blinded to group assignments.\n\nResults: A total of 60 eggs were randomised: 30 to the ANP-HA-GNPs group and 30 to the control group. In the in ovo model, ANP-HA-GNPs significantly reduced tumor growth and angiogenesis compared to controls (mean difference = 2.5 mm, 95% CI 1.8 to 3.2; p < 0.001). In the rat model, ANP-HA-GNPs administered via eye drops also demonstrated significant tumor reduction. No adverse events were reported in either group.\n\nInterpretation: ANP-HA-GNPs show promise as a minimally invasive adjuvant treatment for chemoresistant RB, effectively reducing tumor growth and angiogenesis. Further clinical trials are warranted.\n\nTrial registration: Not provided.\n\nFunding: The study was funded by institutional grants.",
