The primary outcomes were the need for an emergency department visit and the incidence of seroma, assessed over the postoperative period. Randomisation was computer-generated, and allocation was concealed. Blinding was not applied.\n\nResults: A total of 227 patients were randomised, with 115 in the patch group and 112 in the drainage group. Analysis was conducted on all participants using an intention-to-treat approach. The incidence of emergency department visits was significantly higher in the drainage group (33.0%) compared to the patch group (7.0%), with an incidence rate difference of 26.1% (95% CI 14.5 to 37.7; p < 0.0001). Conversely, the seroma rate was higher in the patch group (49.6%) than in the drainage group (26.8%), with an incidence rate difference of 22.8% (95% CI 6.7 to 38.9; p < 0.006). Cost savings of €100.41 per patient were observed with the patch. No severe adverse events were reported in either group.\n\nInterpretation: The use of a polyethylene glycol-coated patch in axillary lymph node dissection reduced emergency department visits and overall costs but was associated with a higher incidence of seroma compared to drainage. These findings suggest that while the patch offers economic benefits, its clinical implications regarding seroma management require further investigation. Trial registration: NCT04487561.
