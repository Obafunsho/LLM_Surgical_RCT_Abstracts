A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Augmented Reality Navigation in Total Hip Arthroplasty\n\nBackground: This randomised controlled trial evaluated the effectiveness of a commercially available augmented reality (AR) navigation system in improving cup positioning during total hip arthroplasty (THA) compared to conventional techniques.\n\nMethods: Seventy-two patients undergoing THA were randomly assigned to either the AR navigation group or the conventional technique group. All patients received cementless acetabular cups via a posterior approach. The primary outcome was cup positioning, measured by the absolute differences between intended and achieved angles, and the number of cups within the Lewinnek safe zone, assessed within one week post-surgery. Secondary outcomes included operative factors, improvement in the Hip Disability and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (HOOS), and postoperative course. Randomisation was performed using a computer-generated sequence with allocation concealment. Blinding was not specified.\n\nResults: AR navigation improved cup positioning, with median absolute differences of 1° (IQR 0° to 4.0°) versus 5° (IQR 3.0° to 7.5°) for abduction and 2° (IQR 1.9° to 3.7°) versus 5° (IQR 3.2° to 9.7°) for anteversion (p < 0.001 and p = 0.001, respectively). Ninety-four percent of cups in the AR group were within the safe zone compared to 64% in the control group (p < 0.001). No significant differences were observed in HOOS improvement or complication rates.\n\nTrial registration: Not provided.\n\nFunding: Not specified.",
