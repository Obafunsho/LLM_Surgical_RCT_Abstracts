A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Postoperative Perturbation Training on Gait Mechanics After ACL Reconstruction\n\nBackground: Movement asymmetries during walking post-ACL reconstruction may lead to early posttraumatic osteoarthritis. This study investigates the impact of postoperative perturbation training on gait mechanics.\n\nMethods: This randomised controlled trial involved 40 men post-ACL reconstruction, randomised to strength, agility, and secondary prevention (SAP) or SAP plus perturbation training (SAP+PERT). Participants were recruited from a single orthopedic clinic, meeting criteria of ≥80% quadriceps strength symmetry, minimal knee effusion, full ROM, no pain, and completion of a running progression. Randomisation was computer-generated with allocation concealment. Outcome assessors were blinded. Gait mechanics were evaluated at 1 and 2 years postoperatively, focusing on sagittal and frontal plane hip and knee angles and moments. The primary outcome was the elimination of gait asymmetries.\n\nResults: No significant differences were observed between SAP and SAP+PERT groups in biomechanical gait variables. At 1 year, 11 of 18 SAP and 11 of 20 SAP+PERT athletes exhibited truncated knee excursions during weight acceptance (odds ratio: 0.8, p = 0.70) and midstance (SAP 12 of 18, SAP+PERT 12 of 20; odds ratio: 0.8, p = 0.67). At 2 years, asymmetries persisted with 7 of 17 SAP and 8 of 19 SAP+PERT athletes affected during weight acceptance (odds ratio: 1.0, p = 0.96) and midstance (SAP 5 of 17, SAP+PERT 11 of 19; odds ratio: 3.3, p = 0.09). No adverse events were reported.\n\nInterpretation: Postoperative perturbation training did not significantly enhance gait symmetry compared to SAP alone. Persistent asymmetries indicate the need for additional interventions. Trial registration: [Number]. Funding: [Source].",
