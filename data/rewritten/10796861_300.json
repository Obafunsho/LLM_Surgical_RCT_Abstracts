A 300-word version\n\nBackground: This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of acetaminophen and topical diclofenac (AtopD) combination therapy compared to monotherapies in osteoarthritis (OA) pain, using evidence from acute pain settings through a model-based meta-analysis (MBMA).\n\nMethods: A literature search was conducted to identify randomized controlled trials (RCTs) from the MEDLINE database studying the AtopD combination for acute pain. An MBMA was implemented to assess pain score reduction and opioid-sparing effect (OSE). The analysis focused on 5 RCTs with 353 patients, evaluating the interaction coefficient for OSE.\n\nResults: The AtopD combination showed greater pain score reduction compared to acetaminophen monotherapy. However, pain score reduction was more susceptible to confounding by opioid patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) than OSE. The MBMA revealed a statistically significant interaction coefficient, indicating a 32% reduction in opioid use with the combination versus acetaminophen monotherapy. Differences in effect size were less conclusive versus diclofenac monotherapy.\n\nInterpretation: The AtopD combination demonstrated greater pain reduction and opioid-sparing efficacy compared to acetaminophen monotherapy. Given the similar pain pathways and mechanisms of action in acute and mild-to-moderate OA pain, comparable beneficial effects may be anticipated in chronic OA pain. Prospective RCTs and real-world studies are needed to confirm these findings. The study highlights the potential of AtopD combination therapy to provide effective pain management and reduce opioid consumption in OA patients, addressing an unmet need for well-tolerated treatments. Further research should focus on confirming these results and exploring the long-term benefits and safety of the combination therapy in diverse patient populations.",
