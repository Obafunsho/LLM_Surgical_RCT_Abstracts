Participants were patients with HCC eligible for liver transplantation, with randomisation at the patient level. The primary outcome was overall survival, measured over a median follow-up of 5.3 years. Response to bridging therapy was categorized as controlled or progressive disease based on imaging and pathology reports. Randomisation and allocation concealment methods were not specified. Blinding details were not provided.\n\nResults: Of 525 patients, 350 received bridging therapy. Tumour progression was an independent risk factor for overall survival (HR 1.80; P = 0.005). Patients within the Milan criteria (MC) at listing had longer survival with controlled disease (6.8 vs. 5.8 years; P < 0.001). Downstaging from outside to within the MC did not improve survival compared to those always within the MC (6.2 vs. 6.6 years; P = 0.030). Adverse events were not reported.\n\nInterpretation: The study highlights that patients with HCC within the MC who do not show tumour progression under locoregional therapy have the best outcomes post-transplant. Downstaging into the MC limits does not enhance survival probability. These findings suggest that disease control under bridging therapy is crucial for improved prognosis, while downstaging does not equate to outcomes seen in patients consistently within the MC.\n\nTrial registration: NCT00355862.\n\nFunding: Not specified.",
