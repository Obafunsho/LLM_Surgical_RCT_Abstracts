A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Multimodal Prehabilitation in Colorectal Cancer Surgery\n\nBackground: Multimodal prehabilitation is proposed to improve postoperative outcomes in colorectal cancer patients with low functional capacity. This study assessed its impact on immediate postoperative recovery.\n\nMethods: This randomised controlled trial was conducted at Zealand University Hospital and Slagelse Hospital, Denmark, from April 2019 to May 2022. Forty patients with colorectal cancer (WHO performance status I or II) scheduled for elective surgery were randomised 1:1 to either a 4-week multimodal prehabilitation program or standard care. The intervention included supervised physical training, nutritional support, and medical optimization. The primary outcome was postoperative recovery within the first 3 days, measured by the Quality of Recovery-15 (QoR-15) questionnaire. Randomisation was performed using random blocks of eight, and allocation was concealed until baseline testing. Blinding was not feasible.\n\nResults: Thirty-six patients were analysed (16 intervention, 20 control). The intervention group demonstrated a 21.9-point higher QoR-15 score (95% CI 4.5 to 39.3) compared to control, surpassing the minimal clinically relevant difference of 8. Adverse events occurred in 3/16 (19%) intervention and 3/20 (15%) control patients, with no serious events attributed to the intervention. The mean age of participants was 79 years, and the study was conducted per protocol due to the exclusion of patients who did not undergo surgery.\n\nInterpretation: Multimodal prehabilitation significantly enhanced postoperative recovery in patients with low functional capacity undergoing colorectal cancer surgery. These findings support the integration of prehabilitation into standard care for this patient population.\n\nTrial registration: NCT04167436\n\nFunding: Not specified.",
