A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial Evaluating Pleth Variability Index in Orthotopic Liver Transplantation\n\nBackground: Fluid management in orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) is challenging. This study evaluates the pleth variability index (PVI) as a predictor of fluid responsiveness in OLT compared to other hemodynamic indices measured by the PiCCO 2 system.\n\nMethods: This single-center study included 25 patients undergoing OLT at Inonu University, Turkey. Eligibility criteria excluded patients with cardiac arrhythmias, low left ventricular function, renal dysfunction, valvular heart disease, pulmonary hypertension, or fulminant hepatic failure. Patients were monitored using the Masimo pulse oximeter and PiCCO 2 system. Fluid loading (10 mL/kg colloid) was performed during the dissection and anhepatic phases. Fluid responsiveness was defined as a ≥15% increase in cardiac index (CI TPTD ). The primary outcome was the predictive value of PVI, measured over two surgical phases.\n\nResults: During the dissection and anhepatic phases, 14 (56%) and 18 (75%) patients were responders, respectively. PVI showed no significant predictive value, with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.56 and 0.55 for the dissection and anhepatic phases, respectively. SVV had a higher AUC, indicating better predictive ability.\n\nInterpretation: PVI was not a reliable predictor of fluid responsiveness in OLT, whereas SVV was more reliable. No adverse events related to the intervention were reported.\n\nTrial registration: Not provided.\n\nFunding: Not specified.",
