A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial on Postoperative Sore Throat Prevention\n\nBackground: Postoperative sore throat (POST) is a frequent complication following tracheal intubation. This study evaluates the efficacy of different interventions in preventing POST.\n\nMethods: This randomised controlled trial was conducted in a hospital setting. Eligible participants were adults undergoing elective surgery with tracheal intubation. Participants were randomly assigned to receive pharmacological interventions (NSAIDs or steroids), non-pharmacological interventions, or traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) therapy. The primary outcome was the incidence of POST within 24 hours post-surgery. Randomisation was computer-generated, and allocation was concealed using sealed envelopes. Outcome assessors were blinded to group assignments.\n\nResults: A total of 200 participants were randomised: 100 to the intervention group and 100 to the control group, recruited between January 2020 and June 2021. The analysis included 98 participants in the intervention group and 97 in the control group, using an intention-to-treat approach. The intervention group showed a significant reduction in POST incidence compared to the control group (mean difference = 15%, 95% CI 10% to 20%; p < 0.01). Adverse events were mild, with 3% in the intervention group and 1% in the control group experiencing minor side effects.\n\nInterpretation: The study demonstrates that pharmacological, non-pharmacological, and TCM interventions effectively reduce POST incidence. These findings suggest that incorporating these strategies into routine clinical practice could improve patient recovery and satisfaction. Further research is needed to explore the mechanisms underlying these interventions. Trial registration: NCT12345678. Funding: Supported by hospital intramural sources.",
