Participants were presented with a hypothetical trial comparing IVT+EVT (standard care) with EVT alone (experimental arm), where both arms achieved similar functional independence at 90 days. Respondents indicated the level of certainty required to skip IVT in clinical practice.\n\nResults: Out of 600 invited participants, 180 responded (response rate: 30%), with 165 providing complete answers. The median acceptable uncertainty for reasonable comparability was an absolute difference of 3% in the rate of day 90 functional independence (mode 5%, IQR 1–5%). Interventionalists chose higher margins (aOR 2.20, 95% CI 1.06 to 4.67). No adverse events were reported.\n\nInterpretation: Most physicians would consider EVT alone if trial data showed similar functional independence at 90 days between groups, with confidence that no more than 3 out of 100 patients would not achieve independence due to skipping IVT. This study provides insights into acceptable non-inferiority margins for future trials.\n\nTrial registration: Not applicable.\n\nFunding: Not specified.",
