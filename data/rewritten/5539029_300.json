A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial Comparing Core Decompression and Vascularized Fibular Grafting for Osteonecrosis of the Femoral Head\n\nBackground: Osteonecrosis of the femoral head is difficult to manage. This study evaluates core decompression versus vascularized fibular grafting regarding femoral head vascularity, disease progression, and hip function.\n\nMethods: Conducted at Zhongshan Hospital, Fudan University, from June 2010 to October 2012, this randomised controlled trial included patients with ARCO Stages I-IIIB bilateral osteonecrosis. Of 51 potential participants, 33 met inclusion criteria, and 27 were randomised. Each patient's hips were randomly assigned to core decompression or fibular grafting. SPECT/CT assessed vascularity at baseline, 6, and 36 months. MRI evaluated ARCO stage progression at baseline, 6, 12, 24, and 36 months. Harris hip score (HHS) was measured pre-treatment and at 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, and 36 months. Randomisation was by bilateral hip assignment; allocation concealment and blinding details were not specified.\n\nResults: At 6 and 36 months, fibular-grafted hips showed higher vascularity than decompression-treated hips (mean difference at 6 months: −27%; 95% CI, −32% to −23%; p < 0.001). ARCO stage progression was more severe in decompression-treated hips at 36 months (p = 0.027). HHS favored fibular grafting from 18 months onward (mean difference at 18 months: −13; 95% CI, −15 to −7; p < 0.001). No significant difference in progression to THA was observed (p = 0.893). Six patients were lost to follow-up.\n\nInterpretation: Vascularized fibular grafting improved vascularity and reduced osteonecrosis progression compared to core decompression. HHS differences became clinically significant by 18 months. No adverse events were reported. Trial registration and funding details were not provided. The study highlights the potential of fibular grafting for better mid-term outcomes in femoral head osteonecrosis.",
