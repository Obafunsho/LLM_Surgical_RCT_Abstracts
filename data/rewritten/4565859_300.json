Eligibility criteria included no prior neck dissection or radiotherapy. Patients received 50 µg [99m Tc]tilmanocept radiolabeled with either 0.5 mCi (same day) or 2.0 mCi (next day), followed by lymphoscintigraphy, SLNB, and elective neck dissection (END). The primary outcome was the FNR of SLNB, measured from June 2009 to November 2012.\n\nResults: Of 85 patients injected, 83 underwent SLNB/END. [99m Tc]Tilmanocept identified SLNs in 81 of 83 patients (97.6%). Among 39 patients with tumor-positive nodes, one had a false negative, yielding an FNR of 2.56% (95.03% CI 0.06–13.49; p = 0.0205). The negative predictive value (NPV) was 97.8%, and overall accuracy was 98.8%. No significant differences were observed between same-day and next-day procedures. No drug-related serious adverse events were reported.\n\nInterpretation: [99m Tc]Tilmanocept provides high SLN identification rates and accurately predicts nodal status in intraoral HNSCC, with low FNR and high NPV. Its use may reduce the need for extensive procedures like END. The trial was registered under NCT00911326. Funding sources were not specified. The study supports the potential of [99m Tc]tilmanocept in improving surgical outcomes for HNSCC patients.",
