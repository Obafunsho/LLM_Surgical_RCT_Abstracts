A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Repeated COVID-19 Vaccination Strategies in Kidney Transplant Recipients\n\nBackground: This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of different repeated COVID-19 vaccination strategies in kidney transplant recipients (KTRs) with poor serological responses after 2 or 3 doses of an mRNA-based vaccine.\n\nMethods: In a multicenter, open-label, randomised controlled trial (NCT05030974), 125 KTRs were randomised to receive a single dose of mRNA-1273 (100 μg, n=25), a double dose of mRNA-1273 (2×100 μg, n=25), or a single dose of Ad26.COV2.S (n=25). Additionally, 50 KTRs receiving 100 μg mRNA-1273 were randomised to continue (n=25) or discontinue (n=25) mycophenolate mofetil/mycophenolic acid. The primary outcome was the change in SARS-CoV-2-specific interleukin-21 memory T-cell and B-cell responses, measured 28 days post-vaccination.\n\nResults: Repeated vaccination increased the seroconversion rate from 21% to 66%, significantly associated with enhanced levels of SARS-CoV-2-specific interleukin-21 memory T cells (odds ratio, 3.84 [1.89-7.78]; P<0.001) and B cells (odds ratio, 35.93 [6.94-186.04]; P<0.001). No significant differences were observed among the vaccination strategies. No adverse events were reported.\n\nInterpretation: Repeated COVID-19 vaccination enhances cellular immune responses in KTRs, with no strategy proving superior. The study underscores the importance of virus-specific memory T- and B-cell responses in understanding vaccine efficacy in this population.\n\nTrial registration: NCT05030974\n\nFunding: Supported by the Dutch Renal patients COVID-19 VACcination consortium.",
