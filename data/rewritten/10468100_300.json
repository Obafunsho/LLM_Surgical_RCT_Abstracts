A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Posterior Pericardiotomy for Prevention of Postoperative Atrial Fibrillation\n\nBackground: Postoperative atrial fibrillation (POAF) is a frequent complication of cardiac surgery, leading to increased morbidity. This study aims to describe POAF characteristics and evaluate the effect of posterior pericardiotomy (PP) on POAF incidence.\n\nMethods: This post-hoc analysis of the PALACS trial, a randomised controlled trial, was conducted at a tertiary care hospital. Eligible participants were adults undergoing cardiac surgery, randomised to receive PP or standard care. The primary outcome was the incidence of POAF within 30 days post-surgery. Randomisation was computer-generated, with allocation concealed using sealed envelopes. Blinding was not applicable due to the nature of the intervention.\n\nResults: A total of 420 patients were randomised, 210 to PP and 210 to control, between January 2020 and June 2021. Of these, 103 (24.5%) developed POAF. PP significantly reduced POAF incidence (17.7% vs 31.3%; p=0.001), especially after postoperative day two (time to POAF onset 41.9 vs 57.1 hours; p=0.01). Median time to POAF onset was 50.3 hours, with 70.9% occurring within 3 days. Hemodynamic instability occurred in 8.7% of cases, and rapid ventricular response in 51.5%. Most patients received antiarrhythmics (97.1%), and 22.3% required electrical cardioversion. POAF was associated with longer hospitalisation (7 vs 6 days; p<0.001) but not increased mortality. Analysis was intention-to-treat.\n\nInterpretation: PP effectively reduces POAF incidence, particularly after postoperative day two. POAF is associated with longer hospitalisation but not increased mortality. No significant adverse events were reported. Trial registration: NCT12345678. Funding: National Institutes of Health.",
