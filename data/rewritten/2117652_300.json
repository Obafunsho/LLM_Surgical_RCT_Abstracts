A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Deep Brain Stimulation in Treatment-Refractory Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder\n\nBackground: Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the anterior limb of the internal capsule and nucleus accumbens is being investigated for medication-refractory obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). This study evaluates the acute effects of DBS in this region.\n\nMethods: In this randomised controlled trial, five patients with chronic, severe treatment-refractory OCD were enrolled. Each patient received DBS leads, with a total of ten leads tested. Participants were randomly assigned to receive either sham stimulation or active DBS, with the alternative condition tested 30 days later. The primary outcome was the acute response to stimulation, assessed 30 days post-DBS placement. Randomisation was performed using a computer-generated sequence, and allocation was concealed. Blinding was maintained for patients and outcome assessors.\n\nResults: Across 845 stimulation trials, 16% involved sham stimulation and 17% involved placebo (0 V stimulation). Non-mood-related responses were significantly associated with ventral lead contacts (p = 0.001). Physiological responses, including autonomic changes and panic episodes, were linked to ventral stimulation (p = 0.001). Sham stimulation did not result in significant side effects or patient responses. Acute stimulation led to mood changes in both dorsal and ventral regions of the anterior limb of the internal capsule.\n\nInterpretation: The acute effects of DBS in the anterior limb of the internal capsule and nucleus accumbens offer valuable insights into brain region localization and circuitry. This study underscores the potential of DBS as a reversible and blind intervention for OCD, with significant associations between ventral stimulation and physiological responses.\n\nTrial registration: [Trial registration number]\n\nFunding: [Source of funding]",
