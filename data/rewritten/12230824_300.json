A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Invasive Hemodynamic Monitoring in Acute Heart Failure: A Randomised Controlled Trial\n\nBackground: This study investigates the impact of invasive hemodynamic monitoring on the management of acute heart failure (AHF) and cardiogenic shock (CS).\n\nMethods: A randomised controlled trial was conducted in cardiac intensive care units. Participants were adults diagnosed with AHF or CS, meeting specific eligibility criteria. Randomisation was performed using a computer-generated sequence, with allocation concealment via sealed envelopes. The intervention group underwent complete hemodynamic assessment, including arterial line, central venous catheter, and pulmonary artery catheter, while the control group received standard care. Outcome assessors were blinded to group assignments.\n\nResults: A total of 200 participants were randomised: 100 to the intervention group and 100 to the control group, recruited between January 2020 and June 2021. The primary outcome was the change in hemodynamic stability, assessed over a 30-day period. In the intervention group, 98 participants were analysed using an intention-to-treat approach, demonstrating a significant improvement in hemodynamic stability (mean difference = 5.2 mm Hg, 95% CI 3.1 to 7.3; p = 0.01). Adverse events occurred in 3% of the intervention group and 1% of the control group, with mild gastrointestinal side-effects reported.\n\nInterpretation: The findings indicate that invasive hemodynamic monitoring significantly enhances hemodynamic stability in patients with AHF and CS. This supports its integration into clinical practice for improved management and outcomes in these patient populations.\n\nTrial registration: NCT12345678\n\nFunding: The trial was funded by the National Heart Institute, ensuring the independence of the research process.",
