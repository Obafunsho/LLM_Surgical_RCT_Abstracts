A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Del Nido Cardioplegia in Cardiac Surgery\n\nBackground: Del Nido (DN) cardioplegia is widely used in cardiac surgery for myocardial protection up to 90 minutes. Its safety and efficacy during prolonged ischemia remain unclear.\n\nMethods: This retrospective study analyzed 471 patients who underwent cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) between January 2019 and September 2024. Patients were divided into two groups based on aortic cross-clamp (ACC) duration: 60–90 minutes (Group A, n=240) and >90 minutes (Group B, n=231). The primary outcome was postoperative troponin I levels, measured within 24 hours. Secondary outcomes included lactate levels, defibrillation requirements, and vasoactive inotropic score (VIS). Propensity score matching was used to balance baseline characteristics.\n\nResults: Group B exhibited significantly higher troponin I levels (mean difference = 0.27, p<0.05) and elevated lactate levels at 4 hours post-CPB, which normalized within 24 hours. Defibrillation requirements and VIS were significantly elevated in Group B, reflecting compromised myocardial electrical stability and hemodynamic challenges. However, long-term outcomes such as mortality, low cardiac output syndrome (LCOS), and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) showed no significant differences between the groups.\n\nInterpretation: While DN cardioplegia provides sufficient myocardial protection for ACC durations within 90 minutes, its efficacy diminishes during prolonged ischemia, as evidenced by increased myocardial injury and hemodynamic instability. Tailored strategies, including standardized redosing protocols and enhanced perioperative management, are essential for optimizing outcomes in complex surgeries with extended ischemia times. Further prospective studies are needed to refine these protocols and assess alternative solutions for myocardial protection.\n\nTrial registration: Not applicable.\n\nFunding: Not reported.",
