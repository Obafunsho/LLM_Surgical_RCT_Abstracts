This trial compared the efficiency and quality of conventional and methylene blue-assisted methods.\n\nMethods: This single-center, randomised controlled trial was conducted at Kanagawa Cancer Center. Participants included 60 patients with histologically proven adenocarcinoma of the stomach, clinical stage I-III, and planned R0 resection with D1+ or D2 lymphadenectomy. Patients were randomised using a centralized dynamic method, stratified by lymphadenectomy type, gastrectomy type, and surgical experience. The primary outcome was the ratio of harvested LNs per minute, measured during surgery. The secondary outcome was the total number of harvested LNs. Blinding was not applicable.\n\nResults: Between August and December 2012, 60 patients were randomised: 29 to the conventional method and 31 to the methylene blue method. All patients were analysed using an intention-to-treat approach. The methylene blue arm showed a higher mean number of harvested LNs (43.4±13.9) compared to the conventional arm (33.6±11.9; p=0.005). The primary outcome ratio was also higher in the methylene blue arm (1.49±0.59 LNs/min) than in the conventional arm (1.12±0.46 LNs/min; p=0.010). No adverse events were reported.\n\nInterpretation: The methylene blue-assisted technique demonstrated superior efficiency and quality in LN harvesting compared to the conventional method.
