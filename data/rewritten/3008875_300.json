  "abstract": "Title: A Double-Blind Randomised Controlled Trial Comparing Minimally Invasive and Classic Approaches in Total Hip Arthroplasty\n\nBackground: Minimally invasive surgery (MIS) for total hip arthroplasty (THA) is hypothesized to offer faster rehabilitation due to smaller incisions and reduced muscle dissection compared to the classic approach (CLASS). This study evaluates the clinical outcomes of MIS versus CLASS.\n\nMethods: Conducted at a single center, this double-blind, randomised controlled trial enrolled 120 patients eligible for primary noncemented THA from January 2005 to November 2007. Participants were randomly assigned to MIS or CLASS groups using a block-randomised, stratified method based on surgical approach (anterolateral or posterolateral). The primary outcome was the Harris Hip Score (HHS) at 6 weeks postoperatively. Blinding was maintained for patients and outcome assessors. An intention-to-treat analysis was performed.\n\nResults: Of the 120 patients randomised, 60 were assigned to each group. At 6 weeks, the MIS group demonstrated a statistically significant increase in mean HHS compared to the CLASS group (mean difference = 4.5, 95% CI 0.5 to 8.5; p = 0.03), primarily due to favorable results in the posterolateral MIS subgroup. The MIS group experienced longer surgical times and a higher, though not statistically significant, perioperative complication rate. Adverse events included six complications in the MIS group and two in the CLASS group. A learning curve was observed, with reduced complications and operative time over the study period.\n\nInterpretation: Although MIS showed a statistically significant improvement in HHS at 6 weeks, the difference was not clinically relevant. The learning curve associated with MIS may contribute to increased operative time and complications. Careful consideration is required when selecting the surgical approach for THA.
