This study assesses the BEACON Caresystem, a decision support tool, for its impact on ventilation duration.\n\nMethods: Conducted as a multicentre, randomised controlled trial, the study involved adult ICU patients ventilated for over 24 hours. Participants were randomised to either the BEACON Caresystem (intervention) or usual care (control). The primary outcome was the duration of mechanical ventilation from intubation to successful extubation. Randomisation was computer-generated, with allocation concealment via sealed envelopes. Blinding was not feasible due to the nature of the intervention.\n\nResults: From September 2017 to March 2020, 252 patients were randomised (58 intervention, 54 control). Due to early termination from the COVID-19 pandemic, 112 patients were analysed. No significant difference in ventilation duration was found between groups. However, the intervention group experienced fewer adverse events, primarily hypoxaemia, and lower tidal volumes. Adverse events were reported in 9% of the intervention group compared to 15% in the control group. The intervention group also showed more frequent ventilator adjustments, particularly in FIO2 settings.\n\nInterpretation: While the BEACON Caresystem did not significantly reduce the duration of mechanical ventilation, it demonstrated potential in reducing adverse events and improving physiological parameters. These findings suggest the need for further research to explore the system's benefits in different settings and patient populations.\n\nTrial registration: NCT12345678\n\nFunding: Supported by [Funding Source].",
