Mindfulness training has shown potential in improving mental health in high-stress populations but has not been tested in surgical settings.\n\nMethods: This pilot randomised controlled trial was conducted at a tertiary academic medical center from April 30, 2016, to December 2017. Twenty-one surgical interns were randomised to either an 8-week modified Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) program or an active control. The primary outcome was feasibility, assessed across six domains using focus groups, interviews, surveys, attendance, daily practice time, and self-reported experience. Randomisation was performed at the individual level, and allocation concealment was ensured. Blinding was not applicable.\n\nResults: Thirteen men (62%) participated, with a mean age of 29.0 years in the intervention group and 27.4 years in the control group. The intervention was feasible and acceptable, with no attrition and high attendance. No significant differences in weekly practice days were observed between groups. Satisfaction and perceived credibility were higher in the intervention group (P = .03). Mindfulness skills were integrated into personal and professional settings, with continued practice over 12 months. No adverse events were reported.\n\nInterpretation: Modified MBSR is feasible and acceptable for surgical interns, with positive integration into their training. Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT03141190. Funding: Not specified.",
