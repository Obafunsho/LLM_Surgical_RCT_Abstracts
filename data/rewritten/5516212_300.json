A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial on Troponin I Levels and Cardiovascular Complications in Postmenopausal Women Undergoing Cardiac Surgery\n\nBackground: Adverse cardiac events following cardiac surgery are a significant concern for women. This study aims to evaluate the prognostic value of troponin I levels for predicting cardiovascular complications in postmenopausal women undergoing cardiac surgery.\n\nMethods: In this double-blind, randomised controlled trial, 175 postmenopausal women not receiving estrogen replacement therapy and scheduled for coronary artery bypass grafting, with or without valve surgery, were enrolled. Participants were randomised to receive 17 β-estradiol or placebo, starting the day before surgery and continuing for 5 days postoperatively. Randomisation was computer-generated, and allocation was concealed. Blinding included patients, clinicians, and outcome assessors. The primary outcome was major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) within 30 days, defined as Q-wave myocardial infarction, low cardiac output state, or death. Serial 12-lead electrocardiograms and serum troponin I measurements were conducted pre-surgery, upon ICU arrival, and for the first four postoperative days.\n\nResults: Troponin I levels on postoperative day 1 were predictive of MACE (AUC = 0.862). A cutoff of >7.6 ng/mL provided optimal sensitivity and specificity. The negative predictive value was 96%, and the positive predictive value was 40%. No significant difference in troponin I levels or MACE frequency was observed between the 17 β-estradiol and placebo groups. Adverse events were not reported.\n\nInterpretation: Elevated troponin I levels on postoperative day 1 are predictive of MACE in postmenopausal women. Monitoring troponin I levels may help stratify patients at risk for adverse cardiovascular events.\n\nTrial registration: [Trial registration number]\n\nFunding: [Source of funding]",
