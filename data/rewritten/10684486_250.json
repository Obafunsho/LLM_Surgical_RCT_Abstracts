This study compares the efficacy and safety of closed versus open lateral internal sphincterotomy (LIS).\n\nMethods: Eight randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with 1035 participants were included. Participants were adults with chronic anal fissure, predominantly female (54.9%) and with posterior midline fissures (86.1%). The primary outcome was postoperative healing rate, measured over a follow-up period. Randomisation methods varied across studies, with allocation concealment and blinding inconsistently reported.\n\nResults: Overall postoperative healing was 90.2% (closed LIS: 90.1%, open LIS: 90.3%). Recurrent anal fissure occurred in 3.7% of cases (closed LIS: 2.3%, open LIS: 1.4%). Postoperative incontinence was 8.9% (closed LIS: 6.6%, open LIS: 11.0%). Closed LIS had higher recurrence rates (RR = 1.73, 95% CI 0.86–3.47) and lower incontinence rates (RR = 0.60, 95% CI 0.37–0.96) compared to open LIS. Adverse events included postoperative pain and infection, more common in open LIS.\n\nInterpretation: Closed LIS is a safe and effective option for chronic anal fissure, with lower incontinence and similar healing rates compared to open LIS.
