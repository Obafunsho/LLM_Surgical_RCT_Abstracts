A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Polyethylene Glycol-Coated Haemostatic Patch in Reducing Clinically Relevant Postoperative Pancreatic Fistula\n\nBackground: This trial aimed to evaluate the impact of a polyethylene glycol-coated haemostatic patch on the incidence of clinically relevant postoperative pancreatic fistula (CR-POPF) after pancreatoduodenectomy (PD).\n\nMethods: Conducted at Miguel Servet University Hospital, Zaragoza, Spain, this single-centre, open-label, parallel, two-arm, superiority randomised controlled trial included patients aged 18-80 years undergoing PD with pancreatojejunostomy for benign or malignant periampullary tumours. Participants were randomised 1:1 to receive pancreatojejunostomy reinforced with two polyethylene glycol-coated haemostatic patches (patch group) or without reinforcement (control group). The primary outcome was CR-POPF within 90 days, defined as grade B/C according to International Study Group of Pancreatic Surgery criteria. Randomisation was performed using a secure internet-based service with allocation concealment. Data analysis was masked. The sample size calculation was based on reducing the CR-POPF rate from 31% to 5% with 80% power.\n\nResults: Between 15 May 2018 and 22 June 2020, 72 patients were randomised, and 64 were analysed (31 in the patch group and 33 in the control group). The risk of CR-POPF was reduced by 90% (OR 0.10, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.89, P = 0.039). The patch retained its protective effect in a multivariable regression model, reducing CR-POPF risk by 93% (OR 0.07, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.67, P = 0.021). One patient died in the patch group versus three in the control group. No significant differences in secondary outcomes were observed.\n\nInterpretation: The polyethylene glycol-coated haemostatic patch significantly reduced the incidence of CR-POPF after PD, suggesting its potential as a protective intervention.\n\nTrial registration: NCT03419676.\n\nFunding: Not specified.",
