A 300-word version\n\nTitle: A Randomised Controlled Trial of a 60-Second Mindfulness-Based Video Exercise in Orthopaedic Practice\n\nBackground: Mindfulness-based interventions are effective in reducing psychological distress and pain intensity in chronic pain patients. This study assesses the effectiveness and feasibility of a 60-second personalized mindfulness-based video exercise in an orthopaedic setting.\n\nMethods: This single-center, single-blind randomized controlled trial was conducted at an urban academic hospital's orthopaedic practice. A total of 125 patients with upper extremity injuries were randomized to either a mindfulness-based video exercise or an attention placebo control (educational pamphlet). The primary outcome was pain intensity measured by the Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) immediately post-intervention. Secondary outcomes included state anxiety, anxiety symptoms, depression, and anger, assessed using the State Anxiety subscale and Emotion Thermometers. Randomization was computer-generated, and allocation was concealed. Outcome assessors were blinded.\n\nResults: 125 patients were randomized and analyzed (mindfulness: 62, control: 63). The mindfulness group demonstrated improved pain intensity (mean difference: 0.46, 95% CI 0.12-0.80, p=0.008), state anxiety (mean difference: 2.94, 95% CI 1.29-4.59, p=0.001), anxiety symptoms (mean difference: 0.61, 95% CI 0.08-1.14, p=0.024), depression (mean difference: 0.44, 95% CI 0.15-0.73, p=0.004), and anger (mean difference: 0.60, 95% CI 0.26-0.94, p=0.001). The observed differences in pain intensity were below the 1-point minimal clinically important difference (MCID). No adverse events were reported.\n\nInterpretation: The 60-second mindfulness-based video exercise is feasible and acceptable in orthopaedic practices, improving pain and psychological distress. However, the clinical significance of these improvements remains unclear. Future studies should explore the intervention's effects in patients with higher pain levels and assess cost-effectiveness.\n\nTrial registration: Not provided. Funding: Not reported.",
