Eligibility criteria included patients aged 65 years or older with stage III NSCLC. Participants were randomised to receive either oral vinorelbine with cisplatin and radiotherapy or standard cisplatin-based CCRT. The primary outcome was overall response rate (ORR) measured at 3 months post-treatment. Randomisation was computer-generated, and allocation was concealed using sealed envelopes. Blinding was not applied to patients or clinicians, but outcome assessors were blinded.\n\nResults: A total of 200 participants were randomised: 100 to the intervention group and 100 to the control group. Analysis was conducted on 98 participants in the intervention group and 97 in the control group using an intention-to-treat approach. The ORR was 54% in the intervention group compared to 37% in the control group (p = 0.02). Adverse events included grade 3 neutropenia in 9% of the intervention group and 4% in the control group. No treatment-related deaths were reported.\n\nInterpretation: Oral vinorelbine in CCRT shows a favorable risk-benefit profile and improved ORR in elderly patients with locally advanced NSCLC. Further studies are warranted to confirm these findings.\n\nTrial registration: NCT12345678\n\nFunding: This study was funded by the National Cancer Institute.",
