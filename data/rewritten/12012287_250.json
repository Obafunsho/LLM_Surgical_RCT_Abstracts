A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Pulsatile vs Nonpulsatile Cardiopulmonary Bypass in Pediatric Congenital Heart Surgery\n\nBackground: This study aimed to evaluate the impact of pulsatile versus nonpulsatile cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) on cerebral hemodynamics and clinical outcomes in pediatric patients with congenital heart disease (CHD), stratified by acyanotic and cyanotic conditions.\n\nMethods: In this randomised controlled trial, 159 pediatric patients (<18 years) undergoing cardiac surgery at Penn State Health Children's Hospital were randomised to pulsatile (n=83) or nonpulsatile (n=76) CPB. Participants were stratified by CHD type. The primary outcome was organ injury, measured by the Pediatric Logistic Organ Dysfunction-2 (PELOD-2) score at 24, 48, and 72 hours postoperatively. Randomisation was computer-generated, and allocation was concealed. Blinding was not applied.\n\nResults: The pulsatility index was higher in the pulsatile group (p<0.05), but no significant differences were observed in regional cerebral oxygen saturation, mean arterial pressure, or gaseous microemboli counts. PELOD-2 scores decreased similarly across groups. No significant differences in secondary outcomes, including Pediatric Risk of Mortality-3 score, vasoactive–inotropic score, mechanical ventilation duration, ICU and hospital stay, and 180-day mortality, were found. Adverse events were not reported.\n\nInterpretation: Pulsatile CPB resulted in higher pulsatility indices but did not improve cerebral hemodynamics or clinical outcomes compared to nonpulsatile CPB in acyanotic or cyanotic CHD patients.\n\nTrial registration: NCT00862407\n\nFunding: Not specified.",
