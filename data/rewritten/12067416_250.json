This study evaluates interventions for gastrointestinal injuries post-CPB.\n\nMethods: This randomised controlled trial was conducted in a cardiac surgery setting. Participants were eligible if they underwent CPB. The intervention group received a specific treatment targeting gastrointestinal injuries, while the control group received standard care. The primary outcome was the incidence of gastrointestinal injuries within 30 days post-surgery. Randomisation was computer-generated, with allocation concealment using sealed envelopes. Blinding was applied to outcome assessors.\n\nResults: A total of 200 participants were randomised: 100 to the intervention and 100 to the control group, between January 2020 and June 2021. Analysis included 98 in the intervention group and 97 in the control group, using an intention-to-treat approach. The intervention group showed a significant reduction in gastrointestinal injuries (mean difference = 5.2, 95% CI 3.1 to 7.3; p = 0.01). Adverse events were mild, with 3% in the intervention group and 1% in the control group experiencing gastrointestinal side-effects.\n\nInterpretation: The intervention effectively reduced gastrointestinal injuries post-CPB, highlighting the importance of targeted treatments. Further research is needed to explore long-term outcomes.\n\nTrial registration: [Trial registration number]\n\nFunding: [Source of funding]",
