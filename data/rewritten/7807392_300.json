A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Postdischarge Video-Based Virtual Visits vs. In-Person Follow-Up\n\nBackground: The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the adoption of postdischarge video-based virtual visits in surgical care. This study aims to assess the noninferiority of virtual visits compared to in-person follow-up in terms of 30-day hospital encounter rates.\n\nMethods: Conducted as a randomised, active, controlled noninferiority trial, this study took place in an urban setting, involving patients from a small community hospital and a large tertiary care hospital. Participants included those undergoing minimally invasive appendectomy or cholecystectomy. Randomisation was performed in a 2:1 ratio to either video-based virtual visits or in-person visits, using a computer-generated sequence with concealed allocation. The primary outcome was the percentage of patients experiencing a 30-day hospital encounter, including emergency department visits, observation, or inpatient admission. Blinding was not applicable.\n\nResults: Out of 1645 screened patients, 432 were randomised, with 289 assigned to the virtual group and 143 to the in-person group. The analysis followed an intention-to-treat approach. The hospital encounter rate was noninferior for virtual visits (12.8% vs. 13.3% for in-person, Δ 0.5% with 1-sided 95% CI, −∞ to 5.2%). The time spent with clinicians was similar (mean 8.4 minutes virtual vs. 7.8 minutes in-person; P = .30), but the median overall visit time was 27.5 minutes shorter for virtual visits (95% CI, −33.5 to −24.0). No adverse events were reported in either group.\n\nInterpretation: Video-based virtual visits are a viable alternative to in-person follow-up, offering reduced overall visit time without increasing hospital encounter rates, thus supporting their integration into postdischarge care.\n\nTrial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03258177\n\nFunding: Not specified.",
