A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial on Exercise in Abdominal Aortic Aneurysms\n\nBackground: This study evaluates the safety and efficacy of exercise in patients with abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs), addressing the balance between exercise benefits and potential risks.\n\nMethods: A randomised controlled trial was conducted with 65 patients with small AAAs, recruited from a cardiovascular clinic. Participants were randomly assigned to an exercise group (n=33) or a usual care group (n=32) using computer-generated random numbers. The exercise group underwent a supervised program of aerobic and resistance training. The primary outcome was the change in AAA size over 12 months. Blinding was not applied to participants or clinicians, but outcome assessors were blinded. Analysis was performed on an intention-to-treat basis.\n\nResults: The exercise group showed no significant difference in AAA growth compared to the control group (mean difference = 0.2 mm/year, 95% CI -0.5 to 0.9; p=0.45). No adverse events were reported in either group. The exercise group demonstrated improved exercise capacity and ventilatory efficiency.\n\nInterpretation: Light to moderate exercise is safe and beneficial for patients with small AAAs, without accelerating aneurysm growth. These findings support the inclusion of exercise in the management of AAA patients.\n\nTrial registration: N/A\n\nFunding: This study was funded by the National Institute of Health.",
