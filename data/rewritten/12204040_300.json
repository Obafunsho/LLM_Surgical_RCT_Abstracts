  "abstract": "Title: Ultrasonic Pupillometry for Nociception Monitoring: A Randomised Controlled Trial\n\nBackground: Monitoring nociception during general anesthesia is challenging. This randomised controlled trial aimed to evaluate the correlation between ultrasonic pupillary dilation reflex (PDR) and sufentanil dose during anesthesia induction.\n\nMethods: Ninety-three patients, aged 18-65 years, with ASA physical status I or II, scheduled for elective surgery under general anesthesia at the Second Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, were enrolled from March 2021 to October 2023. Participants were randomised into three groups: group P (saline), group S1 (0.2 μg/kg sufentanil), and group S2 (0.4 μg/kg sufentanil). Randomisation was computer-generated with allocation concealment via sealed envelopes. Blinding was maintained for anesthesiologists and outcome assessors. The primary outcome was PDR amplitude and rate, measured at four time points (T0-T3) using ultrasound. Data were analysed per-protocol.\n\nResults: Of the 93 randomised, 89 were analysed (group P: 30, group S1: 31, group S2: 28). PDR amplitude and rate were negatively correlated with sufentanil dose [Spearman r = −0.84, 95% CI −0.88 to −0.77, p < 0.01; Spearman r = −0.74, 95% CI −0.82 to −0.64, p < 0.01]. Only PD responded to stimulation within 30 s, while SBP, DBP, and BIS did not. No adverse events were reported. The study demonstrated that ultrasound is a simple and noninvasive method for quantitative assessment of PDR, showing a significant correlation with sufentanil dose.\n\nTrial registration: ChiCTR2100043771.\n\nFunding: Not specified.",
