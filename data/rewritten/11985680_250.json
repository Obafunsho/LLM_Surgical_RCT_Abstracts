This study aimed to identify characteristic brain signals associated with pain-depression comorbidity in PHN patients.\n\nMethods: This randomised controlled trial was conducted at the Second Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine. Participants included 17 depressed PHN patients, 19 non-depressed PHN patients, and 34 healthy controls (HCs). Eligibility criteria included right-handedness and a diagnosis of PHN. Resting-state functional MRI scans were used to assess fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (fALFF) and regional homogeneity (ReHo) values. The primary outcome was the difference in fALFF values in the right temporal lobe (TL) and its connectivity with the inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) over a 5-minute scan period.\n\nResults: One-way analysis of covariance revealed significant differences in fALFF values in the right TL and its connectivity with the IFG among the three groups. The TL-IFG connectivity was positively associated with positive emotional scores and life quality scores in depressed PHN patients.\n\nInterpretation: The findings highlight TL dysfunction in pain-depression comorbidity among PHN patients, suggesting potential central therapeutic targets to disrupt the pain-depression cycle. No adverse events were reported.\n\nTrial registration: Not provided.\n\nFunding: Not specified.",
