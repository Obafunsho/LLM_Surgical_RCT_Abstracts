The study group comprised 164 miniplates in 42 patients, divided into two groups based on the operator: surgical residents (Group 1) and consultant surgeons (Group 2). The primary outcome was the failure rate of miniplates, assessed over the treatment duration.\n\nResults: The overall failure rate of miniplates was 23.8% (39/164). Group 1 had a failure rate of 31.4% (27/86), while Group 2 had a failure rate of 15.3% (12/78) (p < 0.05). Of all failed miniplates, 69.2% were placed by residents and 30.8% by consultants. No significant differences in failure rates were observed between genders or placement sites. The mean age of patients with failed miniplates was 11.9 years.\n\nInterpretation: The failure rate of miniplates was significantly higher when placed by surgical residents compared to consultant surgeons, indicating that surgical experience is crucial in reducing failure rates. This underscores the importance of careful supervision of residents during miniplate placement to improve outcomes. The study's retrospective nature and limited sample size are noted limitations, suggesting the need for further research with larger cohorts to validate these findings.",
