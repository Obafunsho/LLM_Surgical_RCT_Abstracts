Participants were randomised to receive ECX with or without bevacizumab. Randomisation was computer-generated, and allocation was concealed. Blinding was not applied. The primary outcome was overall survival, measured from randomisation to death from any cause. Eligibility included operable adenocarcinoma of the stomach, oesophagogastric junction, or lower oesophagus, staged according to TNM classification.\n\nResults: Of 1063 randomised patients, 895 underwent resection, with surgical details available for 880. Postoperative complications occurred in 458 patients (52.5%), with 71 (8.1%) experiencing life-threatening complications. The anastomotic leak rate was 13.5% overall, higher in the ECX-B group (23.6% vs. 9.9% in ECX). Pathological data were available for 845 patients; 82.5% had at least 15 nodes removed, with a median harvest of 24 nodes. The R1 resection rate was 24.9%. Analysis was conducted on an intention-to-treat basis.\n\nInterpretation: The trial found no significant difference in overall survival between the treatment arms. Surgical performance met protocol criteria, but the high anastomotic leak rate in the ECX-B group suggests a potential adverse effect of bevacizumab on healing. These findings highlight the need for careful consideration of bevacizumab in surgical settings. Trial registration: NCT00450203. Funding: UK Medical Research Council.",
