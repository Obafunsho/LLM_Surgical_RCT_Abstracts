This study investigates whether supplemental fluid administration during and after elective colon resections decreases the incidence of postoperative wound infections.\n\nMethods: This randomised controlled trial included patients undergoing open colon resection, randomly assigned to small volume (8 mL·kg⁻¹·h⁻¹, n=124) or large volume (16-18 mL·kg⁻¹·h⁻¹, n=129) fluid management. The primary outcome was the incidence of surgical wound infections, defined by purulent exudate with culture-positive pathogenic bacteria or CDC criteria, assessed by a blinded observer within 15 days post-surgery. Wound healing was evaluated using the ASEPSIS scoring system. Randomisation was conducted using [randomisation method], with allocation concealment ensured by [method]. Blinding was applied to outcome assessors.\n\nResults: In the small fluid group, 14 patients developed surgical wound infections, compared to 11 in the large fluid group (P=0.46). ASEPSIS scores were similar between groups: 7±16 (small volume) vs. 8±14 (large volume), P=0.70. No significant adverse events were reported in either group. The analysis was conducted on an intention-to-treat basis.\n\nInterpretation: The study suggests that supplemental hydration within the tested range does not significantly affect the rate of wound infections or wound healing scores in patients undergoing elective colon resection.\n\nTrial registration: [Trial registration number]\n\nFunding: [Source of funding]",
