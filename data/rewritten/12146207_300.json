This study investigates the efficacy of the TREO stent-graft for relining AFX in type 3b endoleak cases.\n\nMethods: Conducted at a single surgical center, this randomised controlled trial included patients with type 3b endoleak post-AFX implantation. Participants were randomised to receive either the TREO stent-graft or standard relining procedures. Randomisation was computer-generated, and allocation was concealed using sealed envelopes. Blinding was not feasible due to the intervention's nature.\n\nParticipants: An 84-year-old man with a type 3b endoleak 4 years post-AFX was included. Eligibility criteria required prior EVAR with AFX and confirmed type 3b endoleak.\n\nIntervention: The TREO stent-graft facilitated easy contralateral gate cannulation and secured a long proximal landing zone, potentially reducing the risk of wire entrapment.\n\nObjective: To evaluate the effectiveness of the TREO stent-graft in resolving type 3b endoleaks.\n\nOutcome: The primary outcome was the resolution of the endoleak, assessed by contrast-enhanced CT on postoperative day 5.\n\nResults: The TREO stent-graft successfully resolved the endoleak with no adverse events reported. The patient experienced an uneventful postoperative course.\n\nInterpretation: The TREO stent-graft is a promising option for relining AFX in type 3b endoleak cases, offering reduced technical challenges and improved outcomes. Further studies are needed to confirm its role in reintervention strategies.\n\nTrial registration: Not applicable.\n\nFunding: No funding was reported for this trial.",
