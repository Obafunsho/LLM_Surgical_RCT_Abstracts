The primary outcome was postoperative urinary retention (POUR) with a non-inferiority margin of 10%. Secondary outcomes included patient comfort, anxiety, and depression. Randomisation was computer-generated, and neither investigators nor patients were blinded. The trial was registered under NCT06718114.\n\nParticipants: Eligibility criteria included adult patients scheduled for elective laparoscopic radical gastrectomy. Exclusions were based on urogenital history or medication affecting urination. Recruitment occurred from December 2021 to June 2024.\n\nIntervention: In the IR group, catheters were removed immediately post-surgery, while in the ER group, removal occurred within 24 hours. Both groups followed ERAS protocols.\n\nResults: Of 248 patients assessed, 92 in the IR group and 89 in the ER group were analysed using intention-to-treat analysis. POUR incidence was 4.4% in the IR group and 3.4% in the ER group (P = 0.733; 1.0% difference, 95% CI −4.6 to 6.6%). Patient comfort was higher in the IR group (mean Kolcaba General Comfort Questionnaire score 74.9 vs. 72.5; P = 0.041). No severe adverse events were reported.\n\nInterpretation: Immediate catheter removal is non-inferior to early removal in terms of POUR incidence and enhances patient comfort. Successful implementation likely depends on multimodal analgesia and goal-directed fluid therapy.\n\nFunding: The study was funded by the Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine.",
