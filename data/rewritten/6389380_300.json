A 300-word version\n\nTitle: A Randomised Controlled Trial of Low Molecular Weight Dextran Sulfate in Islet Transplantation\n\nBackground: The instant blood-mediated inflammatory reaction (IBMIR) during intraportal islet transplantation results in significant islet loss, necessitating multiple donors. This study assesses the efficacy and safety of low molecular weight dextran sulfate (LMW-DS) compared to heparin in preventing IBMIR.\n\nMethods: The CIT-01 study was a phase II, multicenter, open-label, active control, randomized trial. Twenty-four subjects were randomized to receive either LMW-DS or heparin during islet transplantation. The primary outcome was the stimulated C-peptide response measured 75±5 days post-transplant. Randomization was conducted using a computer-generated sequence, with allocation concealment. Due to the open-label design, blinding was not applied.\n\nParticipants: Eligible participants were adults undergoing islet transplantation. The study was conducted across multiple centers.\n\nIntervention: Participants received peritransplant intraportal and systemic treatment with either LMW-DS or heparin, targeting an APTT of 150±10 and 50±5 seconds, respectively.\n\nResults: Twelve participants were randomized to each group. The primary outcome showed no significant difference between LMW-DS and heparin (1.33±1.10 vs. 1.56±1.36 ng/mL, p=0.66). Insulin requirements, metabolic parameters, Clarke and HYPO scores, and quality of life were similar between groups. Adverse events were comparable, mostly related to immunosuppression.\n\nInterpretation: LMW-DS demonstrated similar efficacy and safety to heparin in preventing IBMIR, indicating its potential as an alternative treatment. Further studies with optimized dosing are warranted to enhance islet engraftment.\n\nTrial registration: [Trial registration number]\n\nFunding: [Source of funding]",
