Participants were randomly assigned to model-based RSA or marker-based RSA using computer-generated random numbers, with allocation concealment via sealed envelopes. The primary outcome was the accuracy of RSA measurements, evaluated using a phantom model with micromanipulators for controlled translation and rotation. Clinical precision was assessed through double examinations of 24 patients. Outcome assessors were blinded to group assignments.\n\nResults: A total of 24 patients were randomised, with 12 allocated to each group. The accuracy of model-based RSA was 0.03 mm for subsidence (95% CI, −0.03–0.00) and 0.39° for rotation (95% CI, −0.41 to −0.06), compared to marker-based RSA's 0.06 mm for subsidence (95% CI, −0.04–0.01; p = 0.728) and 0.18° for rotation (95% CI, −0.23 to −0.07; p = 0.358). Clinical precision for model-based RSA was 0.14 mm for subsidence (95% CI, −0.02–0.04) and 0.79° for rotation (95% CI, −0.16–0.18). No adverse events were reported in either group.\n\nInterpretation: While model-based RSA's accuracy for rotation was slightly lower than marker-based RSA, its clinical precision is acceptable, suggesting its suitability for clinical trials of cementless tapered wedge femoral stem designs.\n\nTrial registration: [Trial registration number]\n\nFunding: [Source of funding]",
