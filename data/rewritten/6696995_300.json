A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Plasma Biomarker Kinetics in Identifying Postoperative Pulmonary Complications: A Randomised Controlled Trial\n\nBackground: Postoperative pulmonary complications (PPCs) are common after major abdominal surgery. This study evaluates whether plasma biomarker kinetics can identify patients at risk of PPCs and if these kinetics are influenced by intraoperative positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) levels.\n\nMethods: This preplanned substudy of the PROVHILO trial was conducted in the operating rooms of five centers. Two hundred and forty-two adult patients scheduled for abdominal surgery and at risk of PPCs were randomised to receive either high (12 cmH2O) or low (≤2 cmH2O) PEEP. Plasma samples were collected pre-surgery, post-surgery, and on the fifth postoperative day. Biomarkers measured included TNF-α, IL-6, IL-8, sRAGE, SP-D, CC-16, and KL6. The primary outcome was a composite of individual PPCs. Randomisation was computer-generated, and allocation was concealed. Blinding was applied to outcome assessors.\n\nResults: A total of 242 patients were randomised: 120 to high PEEP and 122 to low PEEP. Analysis was conducted on all patients using an intention-to-treat approach. Increases in TNF-α, IL-6, IL-8, and CC-16, and a decrease in SP-D were more pronounced in patients developing PPCs, but the area under the curve was low for all biomarkers. CC-16 levels increased more in the high PEEP group, indicating potential lung overdistension. No adverse events were reported.\n\nInterpretation: Plasma biomarker kinetics showed distinct patterns with PPC development, but lacked prognostic value. High PEEP was associated with increased CC-16 levels, suggesting lung overdistension. The study highlights the need for further research to identify reliable biomarkers for PPC prediction.
