A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Olaparib Maintenance Therapy in BRCA-Mutated Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma\n\nBackground: Conversion surgery for unresectable pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (UR-M PDAC) with BRCA mutations is an emerging treatment strategy. This study evaluates the efficacy of olaparib maintenance therapy following modified FOLFIRINOX (mFFX) in achieving surgical resectability.\n\nMethods: This single-arm trial was conducted at a tertiary care center. Eligible participants were adults with BRCA2-mutated UR-M PDAC. The intervention involved 8 courses of mFFX followed by 8 months of olaparib. The primary outcome was the rate of conversion to resectable disease, assessed by imaging and surgical exploration. Randomisation and blinding were not applicable due to the single-arm design.\n\nResults: One participant was enrolled and completed the intervention. The primary tumor showed over 60% shrinkage, and hepatic metastases disappeared. Surgical exploration confirmed resectability, and distal pancreatectomy with celiac axis resection was performed, achieving R0 resection and a pathological complete response (pCR). The patient remained recurrence-free for 2 years post-surgery. Adverse events included neuropathy due to mFFX, managed by switching to olaparib. The analysis was per-protocol.\n\nInterpretation: Olaparib maintenance therapy post-mFFX may facilitate conversion surgery in BRCA-mutated UR-M PDAC, achieving pCR and prolonged disease-free survival. These findings suggest a potential role for olaparib in the management of BRCA-mutated PDAC, warranting further investigation in larger trials.\n\nTrial registration: Not provided.\n\nFunding: Not disclosed.",
