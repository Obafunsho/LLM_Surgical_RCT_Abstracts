A 300-word version\n\nBackground: This study assessed the feasibility of perioperative gemcitabine plus erlotinib (G+E) for resectable pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC).\n\nMethods: A multicenter, cooperative group, single-arm phase II trial (ACOSOG Z5041) was conducted from April 2009 to November 2013. Patients with biopsy-confirmed PDAC in the pancreatic head without major mesenteric vessel involvement were eligible. Participants received an eight-week cycle of G+E before and after surgery. The primary endpoint was two-year overall survival (OS). Secondary endpoints included toxicity, response, resection rate, and time to progression. Resectability was assessed retrospectively by central review. \n\nResults: One hundred fourteen patients were eligible, consented, and initiated protocol treatment. By central radiologic review, 97 (85%) met protocol resectability criteria. Grade 3+ toxicity was reported in 60% during the neoadjuvant phase and 79% overall. Twenty-two (19%) did not proceed to surgery, while 83 (73%) were successfully resected. R0 and R1 margins were obtained in 67 (81%) and 16 (19%) resected patients, respectively. Fifty-four completed postoperative G+E (65%). The two-year OS rate for the entire cohort was 40% (95% CI 31–50) with a median OS of 21.3 months (95% CI 17.2–25.9). The two-year OS for resected patients was 52% (95% CI 41–63) with a median OS of 25.4 months (95% CI 21.8–29.6). \n\nInterpretation: Perioperative G+E is feasible for resectable PDAC. Further evaluation of neoadjuvant strategies with more active systemic regimens is warranted. Trial registration: NCT01004314. Funding: National Cancer Institute. The study closed early due to slow accrual; no formal hypothesis testing was performed.",
