A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of NSAIDs as Adjunctive Analgesia in Postoperative Critical Care\n\nBackground: This study aimed to assess the impact of NSAIDs as adjunctive analgesia to opioids in reducing opioid consumption and pain in postoperative critical care patients.\n\nMethods: We conducted a randomised controlled trial with 1,621 adult patients admitted to the ICU for postoperative management after elective procedures. Participants were randomised to receive either NSAIDs as adjunctive therapy to opioids or opioids alone. The primary outcome was opioid utilization, measured as 24-hour oral morphine equivalent (OME) consumption. Randomisation was performed using a computer-generated sequence, and allocation was concealed using sealed envelopes. Blinding was applied to outcome assessors, patients, and clinicians. Data were analysed using an intention-to-treat approach.\n\nResults: NSAID adjunctive therapy reduced 24-hour OME consumption by 21.4 mg (95% CI, 11.8 to 31.0 mg reduction; p < 0.001) and probably reduced pain scores by 6.1 mm on the Visual Analog Scale (95% CI, 12.2 decrease to 0.1 increase; p = 0.06). There was no significant impact on the duration of mechanical ventilation (1.6 hr reduction; 95% CI, 0.4 to 2.7 hr reduction) or ICU length of stay (2.1 hr reduction; 95% CI, 6.1 hr reduction to 2.0 hr increase). Adverse events, including gastrointestinal bleeding and acute kidney injury, were infrequent and not significantly different between groups.\n\nInterpretation: NSAIDs as adjunctive analgesia in postoperative critical care patients reduce opioid use and probably reduce pain scores. The evidence is uncertain for the duration of mechanical ventilation or ICU length of stay. Further research is needed to assess the prevalence of NSAID-related adverse outcomes.\n\nTrial registration: CRD42022332635.\n\nFunding: Not specified.",
