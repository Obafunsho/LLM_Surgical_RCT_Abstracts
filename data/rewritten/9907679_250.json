Participants were randomly assigned to one of five PIEB intervals (35, 40, 45, 50, or 55 minutes) using sequentially numbered opaque envelopes. The primary outcome was effective analgesia, defined as no requirement for patient-controlled epidural analgesia (PCEA) during the first stage of labor. Blinding was maintained for patients and outcome assessors. \n\nResults: Of the 100 participants, 93 were analyzed per protocol. Effective PIEB analgesia was achieved in 89.5% (17/19), 84.2% (16/19), 82.4% (14/17), 52.6% (11/19), and 36.8% (7/19) of patients in the 35, 40, 45, 50, and 55-minute groups, respectively. The estimated PIEB intervals for 50% (EI50) and 90% (EI90) effectiveness were 52.5 (95% CI, 48.4–62.6) and 37.0 (95% CI, 28.4–40.9) minutes, respectively. No severe adverse events were reported.\n\nTrial registration: ChiCTR2100047291.\n\nFunding: Not specified.",
