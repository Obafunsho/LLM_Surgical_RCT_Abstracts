A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial on Troponin I Levels and Cardiovascular Complications in Postmenopausal Women Undergoing Cardiac Surgery\n\nBackground: Adverse cardiac events post-cardiac surgery are significant for women. This study evaluates the prognostic value of troponin I levels for predicting cardiovascular complications in postmenopausal women undergoing cardiac surgery.\n\nMethods: This double-blind, randomised controlled trial involved 175 postmenopausal women not on estrogen replacement therapy, scheduled for coronary artery bypass grafting, with or without valve surgery. Participants were randomised to receive 17 β-estradiol or placebo, starting the day before surgery and continuing for 5 days postoperatively. Randomisation was computer-generated, and allocation was concealed. Blinding included patients, clinicians, and outcome assessors. The primary outcome was major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) within 30 days, defined as Q-wave myocardial infarction, low cardiac output state, or death.\n\nResults: Troponin I levels on postoperative day 1 predicted MACE (AUC = 0.862). A cutoff of >7.6 ng/mL provided optimal sensitivity and specificity. The negative predictive value was 96%, and the positive predictive value was 40%. No significant difference in troponin I levels or MACE frequency was observed between the 17 β-estradiol and placebo groups.\n\nInterpretation: Elevated troponin I levels on postoperative day 1 are predictive of MACE in postmenopausal women. Monitoring troponin I levels may help stratify patients at risk for adverse cardiovascular events.\n\nTrial registration: [Trial registration number]\n\nFunding: [Source of funding]",
