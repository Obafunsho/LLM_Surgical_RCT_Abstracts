A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Surgical Techniques for Choledocholithiasis\n\nBackground: The management of choledocholithiasis remains debated, with various surgical techniques available. This study evaluates the postoperative outcomes of open common bile duct (CBD) exploration, laparoscopic CBD exploration, and a combined endoscopic and surgical approach.\n\nMethods: Conducted in the Department of Surgery over two years, this non-randomised prospective observational study involved 50 patients diagnosed with CBD stones. Participants were selected based on specific eligibility criteria and underwent different interventions: ERCP followed by laparoscopic cholecystectomy, laparoscopic CBD exploration, or open CBD exploration. The primary outcome was stone clearance, assessed intraoperatively and postoperatively over a 12-month follow-up. Randomisation and blinding were not applicable.\n\nResults: The mean age was 53.88 years, with 54% women. Abdominal pain was the primary symptom (98%). Stone clearance rates were similar across methods, with a stricture and stone recurrence rate of 2.94%. The LCBDE group had a significantly longer operative time (328 minutes) compared to ERCP+LC (149 minutes). Postoperative complications included pulmonary issues (22%) and wound infections (20%). No mortality was reported. A comparison of biliary drainage methods post-open CBD exploration showed similar short-term outcomes, with the mean operative time for Roux-en-Y being longer than choledochoduodenostomy or T-tube repair.\n\nInterpretation: Laparoscopic management of CBD stones requires significant expertise and has a steep learning curve. Open CBD exploration is effective for complex cases, especially after failed ERCP, despite higher short-term morbidity. The study highlights the importance of skilled surgical techniques in managing choledocholithiasis and suggests that open CBD exploration remains crucial in certain complex cases.\n\nTrial registration: Not applicable.\n\nFunding: Not specified.",
