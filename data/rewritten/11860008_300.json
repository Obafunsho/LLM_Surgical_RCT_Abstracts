This study aimed to develop a dynamic age-dependent physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model to predict drug pharmacokinetics across different ages.\n\nMethods: This trial involved developing PBPK models for adults (20–59 years) and extrapolating them to pediatrics and geriatrics by adjusting physiological parameters. Four CYP3A substrates—midazolam, fentanyl, alfentanil, and sufentanil—served as model drugs. The primary outcome was the prediction accuracy of plasma concentrations, measured over a simulated timeframe. Randomisation and allocation concealment methods were not applicable. Blinding was not used as this was a simulation study. The study setting was virtual, involving 1000 simulated individuals.\n\nResults: Observed plasma concentrations mostly fell within the 5th–95th percentile of predicted values in 1000 virtual individuals. Predicted AUC0–t and Cmax were within 0.5 to 2 times of clinical observations. Dosage optimization for pediatrics and geriatrics was documented, showing that optimized dosages were lower than recommended dosages for these groups.\n\nInterpretation: The developed PBPK model successfully predicts the pharmacokinetics of CYP3A4-metabolized drugs across age groups and aids in optimizing dosage regimens for pediatrics and geriatrics. This model can be a valuable tool for dose optimization in vulnerable populations, ensuring safer and more effective drug administration.\n\nTrial registration: Not applicable.\n\nFunding: Not specified.",
