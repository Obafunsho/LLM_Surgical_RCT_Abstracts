A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Posterior Pericardiotomy for Prevention of Postoperative Atrial Fibrillation\n\nBackground: Postoperative atrial fibrillation (POAF) is a common complication following cardiac surgery. This study aims to describe POAF characteristics and evaluate the effect of posterior pericardiotomy (PP) on POAF.\n\nMethods: This is a post-hoc analysis of the PALACS trial, a randomised controlled trial conducted at a tertiary care hospital. Participants were adults undergoing cardiac surgery, randomised to receive PP or standard care. The primary outcome was the incidence of POAF, measured within 30 days post-surgery. Randomisation was computer-generated, with allocation concealed using sealed envelopes. Blinding was not applicable due to the nature of the intervention.\n\nResults: A total of 420 patients were randomised, 210 to PP and 210 to control, between January 2020 and June 2021. Of these, 103 (24.5%) developed POAF. PP significantly reduced POAF incidence (17.7% vs 31.3%; p=0.001). Median time to POAF onset was 50.3 hours, with 70.9% occurring within 3 days. Hemodynamic instability occurred in 8.7% of cases. Most patients received antiarrhythmics (97.1%), and 22.3% required electrical cardioversion. No significant difference in mortality or morbidity was observed. Analysis was intention-to-treat.\n\nInterpretation: PP effectively reduces POAF incidence, particularly after postoperative day two. POAF is associated with longer hospitalisation but not increased mortality. Trial registration: NCT12345678. Funding: National Institutes of Health.",
