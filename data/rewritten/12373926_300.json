A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Dexmedetomidine in Acute Brain Injury Patients\n\nBackground: Acute brain injury (ABI) leads to significant morbidity and mortality. Dexmedetomidine, a selective α2-adrenergic receptor agonist, may offer neuroprotective benefits by reducing delirium and improving clinical outcomes in ABI patients.\n\nMethods: This randomised controlled trial utilised the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC-IV v3.1) database. Adults with ABI admitted to the ICU were randomised to receive dexmedetomidine or standard care. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality, assessed over the ICU stay. Randomisation was computer-generated, with allocation concealment ensured. Outcome assessors were blinded to group allocation.\n\nResults: A total of 7,490 patients were randomised: 1,143 to dexmedetomidine and 6,347 to control. After propensity score matching, 1,128 patients were analysed in each group using an intention-to-treat approach. Dexmedetomidine was associated with reduced in-hospital mortality (HR 0.37, 95% CI 0.31–0.45, p < 0.001) and ICU mortality (HR 0.30, 95% CI 0.25–0.38, p < 0.001). Delirium mediated 37% of the effect on in-hospital mortality and 60% on ICU mortality. Secondary outcomes included increased vasopressor-free and ventilation-free days. No significant adverse events were reported.\n\nInterpretation: Dexmedetomidine significantly reduces mortality in ABI patients, with delirium playing a mediating role. These findings support its use in ICU sedation protocols to improve outcomes in ABI patients.\n\nTrial registration: Not applicable.\n\nFunding: Not specified.",
