A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Timing of Adjuvant Chemotherapy in Colorectal Cancer: A Randomised Controlled Trial\n\nBackground: The optimal timing of adjuvant chemotherapy post-surgery for colorectal cancer remains uncertain. This study examines the association between chemotherapy timing and disease-free survival.\n\nMethods: This post hoc analysis of the phase 3 SCOT trial involved 5719 patients from 244 centers across 6 countries. Patients with high-risk stage II or III nonmetastatic colorectal cancer were randomized to receive 3 or 6 months of adjuvant chemotherapy with fluoropyrimidine and oxaliplatin. Randomization was computer-generated with allocation concealment. Participants were grouped based on chemotherapy initiation: <6 weeks vs >6 weeks post-surgery. The primary outcome was disease-free survival over a median follow-up of 72 months. Analysis was intention-to-treat.\n\nResults: Of 5719 patients, 914 were in the early-start group and 4805 in the late-start group. Five-year disease-free survival was 78.0% in the early-start group vs 73.2% in the late-start group (hazard ratio, 1.24; 95% CI, 1.06-1.46; P = .01). Adverse events were similar between groups (odds ratio, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.65-1.04; P = .09).\n\nInterpretation: Starting adjuvant chemotherapy more than 6 weeks after surgery is associated with worse disease-free survival, with no significant difference in adverse events.
