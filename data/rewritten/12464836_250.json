A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy in Reducing Perioperative Stress and ICU Stay in Neurosurgical Patients\n\nBackground: Neurosurgical procedures, particularly for brain tumors, are highly stressful due to diagnostic uncertainties and prolonged recovery. This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) in reducing perceived stress and ICU stay in neurosurgical patients.\n\nMethods: In a randomised controlled trial, 80 adult patients scheduled for elective brain surgery at Shohadaye Tajrish Hospital, Tehran, Iran, from 2020 to 2022, were randomly assigned to either a CBT intervention group or a control group. The intervention group received 15 CBT sessions focused on stress management. Stress levels were measured using Cohen’s Perceived Stress Scale pre- and post-surgery. Randomisation was conducted using simple randomisation, and allocation was concealed. Blinding was not applied.\n\nResults: A total of 40 patients were randomised to each group. Postoperative perceived stress scores were significantly lower in the CBT group (mean difference = 17.09, 95% CI 15.12 to 19.06; p<0.001). The CBT group also had a shorter ICU stay (mean difference = 1.4 days, 95% CI 0.01 to 2.79; p=0.049). No adverse events were reported in either group.\n\nInterpretation: CBT significantly reduces perioperative stress and ICU duration in neurosurgical patients. Integrating CBT into preoperative care may enhance recovery and reduce healthcare costs. Trial registration: Not provided. Funding: Not reported.",
