A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Low-Dose Intravenous Lidocaine for Postoperative Analgesia in Total Hip Arthroplasty\n\nBackground: The analgesic effect of perioperative low-dose intravenous lidocaine has been demonstrated after abdominal surgery. This study aimed to evaluate whether a continuous intravenous (IV) low-dose lidocaine infusion reduced postoperative pain and modified nociceptive pain threshold after total hip arthroplasty.\n\nMethods: This randomised, double-blinded trial included 60 patients undergoing total hip arthroplasty. Participants were randomly assigned to receive either lidocaine 1% (lido group) with a 1.5 mg/kg IV bolus followed by a 1.5 mg/kg/h IV infusion or saline (control group). The intervention started 30 minutes before surgical incision and stopped one hour after skin closure. Randomisation was computer-generated, and allocation was concealed. Both patients and clinicians were blinded. The primary outcome was postoperative analgesia, measured by morphine consumption over 48 hours. Pain scores, pressure pain thresholds, and hyperalgesia extent were secondary outcomes.\n\nResults: Sixty patients were randomised, 30 to each group. Lidocaine did not induce any opioid-sparing effect during the first 24 hours (−2 mg, 95% CI [−5; 9]; p = 0.55). No significant differences were observed in pain scores, pressure pain thresholds, hyperalgesia extent, or hip flexion. Mean plasma lidocaine concentration was 2.1 ± 0.4 μg/ml. No adverse events were reported.\n\nInterpretation: Low-dose perioperative IV lidocaine after total hip arthroplasty offers no beneficial effect on postoperative analgesia and does not modify pressure and tactile pain thresholds.
