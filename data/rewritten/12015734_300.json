This study assesses a novel leukocyte remover designed to reduce these effects.\n\nMethods: Conducted as a substudy within a registered clinical trial (NCT05400356), this research involved seven patients undergoing CPB at West China Hospital, Sichuan University. The intervention was a disposable leukocyte remover featuring an RGD peptide-coated membrane, integrated into an extracorporeal circuit. Blood was circulated for 10 minutes at 300 mL/min. Leukocyte counts and activation markers were evaluated at baseline and after 2.5, 5, 7.5, and 10 minutes. The primary outcome was the reduction in activated neutrophils over 10 minutes. Randomisation and blinding were not applicable due to the study design.\n\nResults: Neutrophil counts and those expressing activation markers CD11b, CD54, CD64, or CD181 decreased by 36–39% within the first 2.5 minutes, with slower declines thereafter. Monocyte and lymphocyte counts showed no significant changes. The membrane retained substantial numbers of intact activated leukocytes, as confirmed by immunostaining and electron microscopy. Blood smears before and after circulation showed no significant differences in leukocyte morphology.\n\nInterpretation: The novel leukocyte remover effectively reduces activated neutrophils in ex vivo blood, with minimal impact on other leukocytes and blood components. These findings suggest potential for reducing inflammation-related complications post-CPB, warranting further investigation in larger studies.\n\nTrial Registration: NCT05400356\n\nFunding: Not specified.",
