A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial on Patient Blood Management in Adult Cardiac Surgery\n\nBackground: This study aimed to develop evidence-based guidelines for patient blood management (PBM) in adult cardiac surgery under cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) to reduce blood loss and allogeneic transfusion.\n\nMethods: A randomised controlled trial was conducted by the Working Group on Cardiopulmonary Bypass and Extracorporeal Life Support of China National Center for Cardiovascular Quality Improvement. Participants were adult patients undergoing cardiac surgery with CPB. The intervention group received a comprehensive PBM program, while the control group received standard care. The primary outcome was the rate of allogeneic blood transfusion, measured perioperatively. Randomisation was performed using a computer-generated sequence, with allocation concealment ensured by sealed envelopes. Blinding was applied to outcome assessors.\n\nResults: A total of 200 participants were randomised: 100 to the intervention group and 100 to the control group, between January 2023 and June 2023. Analysis was conducted on 98 participants in the intervention group and 97 in the control group using an intention-to-treat approach. The intervention group showed a significant reduction in allogeneic transfusion rates (mean difference = 15%, 95% CI 10% to 20%; p < 0.001). Adverse events were reported in 5% of the intervention group and 3% of the control group, with no severe events.\n\nTrial registration: NCT12345678.\n\nFunding: The study was funded by the China National Center for Cardiovascular Quality Improvement.",
