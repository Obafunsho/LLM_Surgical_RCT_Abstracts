A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Biventricular Pacing in Cardiac Surgery Patients\n\nBackground: This study investigates the effect of temporary biventricular pacing with optimized atrioventricular and interventricular delays on cardiac output in patients with left ventricular dysfunction undergoing cardiac surgery.\n\nMethods: In this randomised controlled trial, 20 patients at risk of low cardiac output post-coronary artery bypass grafting and/or valve surgery were enrolled. Participants were randomly assigned to biventricular pacing (n=11) or standard care (n=9). Aortic flow was measured using an electromagnetic flowmeter within one hour post-cardiopulmonary bypass. Randomisation was conducted using a computer-generated sequence, and allocation was concealed. Blinding was not specified.\n\nResults: Optimization of atrioventricular delay (171±8 msec) at an interventricular delay of 0 msec increased flow by 14% compared to the worst setting (111±11 msec, p < 0.001) and 7% compared to nominal atrioventricular delay (120 msec, p < 0.001). Interventricular delay optimization increased flow by 10% compared to the worst setting (p < 0.001) and 5% compared to nominal interventricular delay (0 msec, p < 0.001). Optimized pacing increased cardiac output by 13% compared to atrial pacing at matched heart rate (5.5±0.5 vs. 4.9±0.6 L/min; p = 0.003) and 10% compared to sinus rhythm (5.0±0.6 L/min; p = 0.019).\n\nInterpretation: Temporary biventricular pacing with optimized delays significantly enhances intraoperative cardiac output in patients with left ventricular dysfunction. No adverse events were reported. Trial registration and funding details were not provided.",
