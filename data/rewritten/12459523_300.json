A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of LFCN Block Addition to PENG Block in Hip Fracture Surgery\n\nBackground: This randomised controlled trial assessed the impact of adding a lateral femoral cutaneous nerve (LFCN) block to a pericapsular nerve group (PENG) block on postoperative opioid consumption and pain scores in patients undergoing hip fracture surgery under spinal anesthesia.\n\nMethods: Conducted at Zonguldak Bülent Ecevit University Hospital, Türkiye, from October 2022 to January 2024, 60 patients aged 18-75 were randomised into three groups: PENG, PENG + LFCN, and CONTROL. Eligibility criteria included ASA Physical Status I-III. The PENG group received 20 mL of 0.25% bupivacaine, while the PENG + LFCN group received an additional 5 mL LFCN block. The primary outcome was postoperative opioid consumption within 24 hours. Randomisation was computer-assisted with allocation concealment via sealed envelopes. Outcome assessors were blinded.\n\nResults: 60 patients were analysed (20 per group) using a per-protocol approach. Postoperative opioid consumption was significantly lower in the PENG (8.10 ± 6.72 mg) and PENG + LFCN (8.40 ± 4.38 mg) groups compared to CONTROL (15.30 ± 5.59 mg, P < 0.001). No significant difference was found between PENG and PENG + LFCN groups. Postoperative NRS pain scores during activity were significantly lower in the PENG + LFCN group than in the CONTROL group at all-time points, and lower in the PENG group at 2, 6, and 24 hours. No adverse events were reported.\n\nInterpretation: The addition of an LFCN block to the PENG block did not significantly affect opioid consumption or pain scores compared to PENG alone. Preoperative PENG block is effective for analgesia management during positioning for spinal anesthesia and postoperative pain control. Trial registration: NCT06226675. Funding: Not specified.",
