This study evaluates the efficacy and safety of dexmedetomidine sedation during peripheral nerve block surgery in these patients.\n\nMethods: This single-center, retrospective observational study included 18 patients undergoing peripheral nerve block with dexmedetomidine. Sedation levels were assessed using the observer’s assessment of alertness/sedation (OAA/S) score. Intraoperative stress and memory were evaluated postoperatively using a questionnaire. The primary outcome was intraoperative stress, measured on a 6-point scale.\n\nResults: Sedation levels ranged from OAA/S scores of 3 to 5, indicating appropriate sedation. The mean intraoperative stress score was 0.72, and the mean intraoperative memory score was 2.44. One patient experienced bradycardia, and 9 had hypoxemia, all resolved by adjusting dexmedetomidine dosage and encouraging deep breathing.\n\nInterpretation: Dexmedetomidine sedation during peripheral nerve block surgery effectively reduces patient stress and anxiety. However, attention to hypoxemia is crucial, especially in patients with high BMI. Further research is needed to validate these findings.\n\nTrial registration: Not applicable.\n\nFunding: No financial interest declared.",
