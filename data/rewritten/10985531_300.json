The trial was set across various institutions, with eligibility criteria including patients with suspected lung adenocarcinomas. IMI was performed sequentially during lung inspection, tumor resection, and margin check. The primary outcome was the occurrence of clinically significant events (CSE) that necessitated surgical modification or cancer up-staging. Safety was evaluated for a single intravenous dose of OTL38.\n\nResults: Of 110 patients recruited, 92 were eligible for analysis. During lung inspection, IMI identified 24 additional nodules, 9 of which were occult cancers. During tumor resection, IMI located 11 lesions not found by the surgeon. Margin check revealed 8 positive margins initially thought negative. No serious adverse events were reported. The benefits of IMI were pronounced in patients undergoing sublobar resections and those with ground-glass opacities. All surgeons reported comfort with the procedure after 10 cases.\n\nInterpretation: IMI improved surgical outcomes in 26% of patients, highlighting its potential utility in pulmonary resections. The findings support the initiation of a Phase 3 trial to further assess its efficacy and safety.\n\nTrial registration: NCT02872701\n\nFunding: Not specified.",
