A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Del Nido Cardioplegia in Cardiac Surgery\n\nBackground: Del Nido (DN) cardioplegia is commonly used in cardiac surgery for myocardial protection up to 90 minutes. Its efficacy during prolonged ischemia is uncertain.\n\nMethods: This retrospective study evaluated 471 patients undergoing cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) from January 2019 to September 2024. Patients were divided into two groups based on aortic cross-clamp (ACC) duration: 60–90 minutes (Group A, n=240) and >90 minutes (Group B, n=231). The primary outcome was postoperative troponin I levels, measured within 24 hours. Secondary outcomes included lactate levels, defibrillation requirements, and vasoactive inotropic score (VIS). Propensity score matching was used to balance baseline characteristics.\n\nResults: Group B showed significantly higher troponin I levels (mean difference = 0.27, p<0.05) and elevated lactate levels at 4 hours post-CPB, which normalized within 24 hours. Defibrillation requirements and VIS were significantly higher in Group B, indicating compromised myocardial stability and hemodynamic challenges. No significant differences were observed in long-term outcomes such as mortality, low cardiac output syndrome (LCOS), and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS).\n\nInterpretation: DN cardioplegia provides adequate myocardial protection for ACC durations within 90 minutes but is less effective during prolonged ischemia, as indicated by increased myocardial injury and hemodynamic instability. Tailored strategies, including standardized redosing protocols, are necessary for optimizing outcomes in complex surgeries with extended ischemia times. Further prospective studies are needed to refine these protocols.\n\nTrial registration: Not applicable.\n\nFunding: Not reported.",
