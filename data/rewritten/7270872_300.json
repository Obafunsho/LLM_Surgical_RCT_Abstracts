A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass vs Best Medical Treatment in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes and Early-Stage CKD\n\nBackground: Early-stage chronic kidney disease (CKD) with microalbuminuria in type 2 diabetes is associated with increased cardiovascular risk and progression to end-stage renal disease.\n\nMethods: This single-center, randomised controlled trial was conducted from April 1, 2013, to March 31, 2016, involving 100 patients with type 2 diabetes, obesity (BMI 30-35), and stage G1 to G3 and A2 to A3 CKD. Participants were randomised 1:1 to receive Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) or best medical treatment. The primary outcome was remission of albuminuria (uACR <30 mg/g) at 24 months. Randomisation was computer-generated, and allocation was concealed. Blinding was not applied to patients or clinicians.\n\nResults: A total of 51 patients were randomised to RYGB and 49 to best medical treatment. Intention-to-treat analysis revealed albuminuria remission in 82% (95% CI, 72%-93%) of RYGB patients compared to 55% (95% CI, 39%-70%) in the control group (P = .006). CKD remission rates were 82% (95% CI, 72%-92%) for RYGB and 48% (95% CI, 32%-64%) for controls (P = .002). The geometric mean uACRs were 55% lower in the RYGB group (10.7 mg/g) compared to the control group (23.6 mg/g) (P < .001). No significant difference in the rate of serious adverse events was observed between groups.\n\nInterpretation: RYGB was significantly more effective than best medical treatment in achieving remission of albuminuria and CKD in patients with type 2 diabetes and obesity. The trial was registered under ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier NCT01821508. Funding sources were not specified.",
