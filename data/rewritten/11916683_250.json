A 250-word version\n\nTitle: A Randomised Controlled Trial Comparing the Trachway and Airway Scope for Tracheal Intubation by Novice Operators\n\nBackground: The Trachway is a novel intubation device incorporating a video-assisted system. This study aimed to evaluate its effectiveness compared to the Airway Scope in tracheal intubation by novice operators.\n\nMethods: This randomised cross-over study was conducted in a simulated setting. Participants were novice operators with no prior experience in tracheal intubation. The study compared the Trachway and Airway Scope in routine and difficult intubation scenarios, with the latter simulated by increasing the tongue volume of a manikin. The primary outcome was the time required for successful tracheal intubation. Randomisation was achieved using a computer-generated sequence, and allocation was concealed. Blinding was not applicable due to the nature of the intervention.\n\nResults: A total of 50 participants were randomised, with each participant using both devices. The average intubation time did not differ significantly between the Trachway and Airway Scope in the normal airway scenario (11.2 ± 6.5 vs. 9.8 ± 4.3 seconds; p = 0.07). However, in the difficult airway scenario, intubation time was significantly longer with the Trachway (17.1 ± 11.1 vs. 9.5 ± 4.1 seconds; p < 0.001). Success rates were 96.3% for the Trachway and 98.6% for the Airway Scope (p = 0.13). No adverse events were reported.\n\nInterpretation: While both devices are comparable in normal scenarios, the Airway Scope is more suitable for difficult intubations by novice operators.
