  "abstract": "250-word version:\n\nBackground: Juxtarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm (JR-AAA) presents a therapeutic challenge due to the absence of a proximal landing zone. Parallel stenting techniques, such as the chimney technique, offer a viable endovascular option. Methods: This case study reports on the urgent endovascular treatment of a 62-year-old male with JR-AAA using the chimney technique. The patient was treated with a C3 31x150 mm Excluder® bifurcated endoprosthesis and Viabahn® self-expanding covered stents for both renal arteries. Results: The procedure was completed without complications, and the patient was discharged on the third day post-admission. Follow-up over 24 months showed complete exclusion of the aneurysm, no leaks or stent migration, and preserved renal artery patency. The aneurysm diameter reduced by approximately 15%. Interpretation: The chimney technique is a feasible and effective option for urgent JR-AAA treatment, providing good medium-term outcomes. Further long-term studies are needed to establish its role in complex aneurysm management.",
