This study investigates the effects of complement modulation on lung transplant success.\n\nMethods: This randomised controlled trial was conducted at a tertiary care center. Participants were adults eligible for lung transplantation. The intervention group received a complement inhibitor, while the control group received standard care. Randomisation was computer-generated, with allocation concealment via sealed envelopes. Blinding was applied to outcome assessors.\n\nObjective: To evaluate the impact of complement inhibition on lung transplant outcomes.\n\nOutcome: The primary outcome was the incidence of primary graft dysfunction (PGD) within 72 hours post-transplant.\n\nResults: A total of 200 participants were randomised, 100 to the intervention and 100 to the control group, between January 2020 and June 2021. Analysis included 98 in the intervention group and 97 in the control group, using an intention-to-treat approach. The intervention group showed a significant reduction in PGD incidence (mean difference = 15%, 95% CI 5% to 25%; p = 0.01). Adverse events were mild, with 3% in the intervention group and 1% in the control group experiencing gastrointestinal side-effects.\n\nTrial registration: NCT12345678\n\nFunding: This trial was funded by the National Institutes of Health.",
