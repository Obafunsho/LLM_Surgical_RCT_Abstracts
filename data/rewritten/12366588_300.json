This study aimed to compare the predictive effects of carotid and inferior vena cava (IVC) ultrasound measurements on PIH.\n\nMethods: This prospective observational study included 102 older adults scheduled for elective gastrointestinal surgery, conducted from January to June 2022. Eligibility criteria were age 65-75 years, ASA physical status II-III, and BMI 15-30 kg/m². Before anaesthesia induction, maximum IVC diameter (dIVCmax), minimum IVC diameter (dIVCmin), IVC collapsibility index (IVC-CI), carotid artery blood flow peak velocity variation (ΔVpeak), and carotid corrected flow time (FTc) were measured. FTc(B) and FTc(W) were calculated using Bazett’s and Wodey’s formulas, respectively. PIH was defined as a >30% decrease in systolic blood pressure (SBP) or SBP <90 mm Hg within 15 minutes post-induction.\n\nResults: PIH occurred in 49% of patients. The area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUROC) for FTc(W), FTc(B), and ΔVpeak were 0.815, 0.691, and 0.713, respectively. The AUROC for IVC-CI, dIVCmax, and dIVCmin were 0.666, 0.680, and 0.702, respectively. FTc(W) had significantly higher predictive accuracy than FTc(B) (p=0.003), IVC-CI (p=0.024), and dIVCmax (p=0.046).\n\nInterpretation: FTc(W) measured by ultrasonography is more accurate for predicting PIH in older patients compared to dIVCmax and IVC-CI. FTc(W) also demonstrated better predictive accuracy than FTc(B). These findings suggest that FTc(W) could be a reliable non-invasive predictor of PIH in older individuals undergoing elective surgery.\n\nTrial registration: ChiCTR2100054532.\n\nFunding: Not specified.",
