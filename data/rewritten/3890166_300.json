This study investigates whether an abdominal cutout in TLSOs improves pulmonary function in healthy adults.\n\nMethods: This randomised controlled trial involved 20 healthy adults recruited from [study setting]. Participants were randomly assigned to wear a custom-molded TLSO with a reattachable abdominal cutout. The primary outcome was pulmonary function, assessed by forced vital capacity (FVC) and forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) at rest and after exercise. Participants were evaluated under three conditions: no TLSO (control), TLSO (closed), and TLSO (open). Randomisation was performed using a computer-generated sequence, with allocation concealment ensured. Outcome assessors were blinded to group assignments.\n\nResults: Wearing a TLSO (closed or open) significantly reduced FVC and FEV1 at rest and after exercise compared with controls (p < 0.001). The abdominal cutout (open) increased FVC at rest (95% CI, 3.79–4.76; p = 0.007) and postexercise (95% CI, 3.80–4.73; p = 0.025) compared with the closed TLSO. FEV1 increased postexercise (95% CI, 3.01–3.76; p = 0.02) but not at rest (95% CI, 2.96–3.73; p = 0.053). No adverse events were reported during the study.\n\nInterpretation: TLSOs restrict pulmonary function in healthy adults. Incorporating an abdominal cutout enhances pulmonary function, particularly during physical activity, suggesting its potential benefit in TLSO design for individuals with compromised respiratory function, such as those with neuromuscular disorders, scoliosis, or post-spine surgery.\n\nTrial registration: [Trial registration number]\n\nFunding: [Source of funding]",
