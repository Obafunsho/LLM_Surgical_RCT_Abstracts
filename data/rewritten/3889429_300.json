A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Tourniquet Use in Total Knee Arthroplasty\n\nBackground: The efficacy of continuous tourniquet use in total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is uncertain, with potential for increased complications. This study investigates the impact of limited tourniquet use during cementation only.\n\nMethods: This randomised controlled trial included 71 patients (79 knees) undergoing TKA, randomised to either continuous tourniquet use from incision through cementation (operative tourniquet group) or tourniquet use only during cementation (cementation tourniquet group). Conducted at a single institution, the study excluded patients at high risk for tourniquet-related complications. Randomisation was achieved via a computer-generated sequence with allocation concealment. Blinding details were not specified. The primary outcome was surgical time, with secondary outcomes including postoperative pain, knee motion, blood loss, and complications. A power analysis indicated a requirement for 260 additional cases for statistical significance.\n\nResults: Analysis showed no significant differences between groups in surgical time, pain scores, pain medication requirements, range of motion, hemoglobin change, or total blood loss. One major complication, compartment syndrome, was reported in the operative tourniquet group. No other complications were linked to tourniquet use.\n\nInterpretation: The study suggests no significant clinical differences between continuous and limited tourniquet use in TKA. Limited tourniquet application during cementation may mitigate risks associated with prolonged use, offering a safer alternative without compromising surgical outcomes. Trial registration and funding information were not disclosed. Further research with a larger sample size is recommended to confirm these findings.",
