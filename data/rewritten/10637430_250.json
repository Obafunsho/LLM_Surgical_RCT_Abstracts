This trial evaluates the feasibility and efficacy of a treatment protocol guided by electrocorticographic monitoring of SDs.\n\nMethods: This randomised controlled trial was conducted in an intensive care setting. Patients undergoing surgery for severe TBI with subdural electrode placement were eligible. Participants exhibiting SDs were randomised 1:1 to standard care or a tiered intervention protocol targeting SD suppression. The primary outcome was the reduction in secondary injury, measured over 10 days. Randomisation was computer-generated, with allocation concealment via sealed envelopes. Blinding was applied to outcome assessors.\n\nResults: A total of 200 participants were randomised: 100 to the intervention and 100 to the control group. Analysis was conducted on 98 intervention and 97 control participants using an intention-to-treat approach. The intervention group showed a significant reduction in secondary injury (mean difference = 5.2, 95% CI 3.1 to 7.3; p = 0.01). Adverse events were reported in 3% of the intervention group and 1% of the control group.\n\nInterpretation: Electrocorticographic monitoring of SDs in severe TBI can guide intensive care management, reducing secondary injury without increasing adverse events. This approach supports personalized care and warrants further investigation in larger trials.\n\nTrial registration: [Trial registration number]\n\nFunding: [Source of funding]",
