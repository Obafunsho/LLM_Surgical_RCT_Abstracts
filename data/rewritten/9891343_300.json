A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial Comparing Continuous and Interrupted Suture Techniques for Biliary-Enteric Anastomosis\n\nBackground: This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of continuous suture (CS) versus interrupted suture (IS) techniques for biliary-enteric anastomosis (BEA) by assessing suture time and biliary complications.\n\nMethods: Conducted at University Hospital Dresden, this single-centre randomised controlled trial included 82 patients scheduled for elective open BEA between January 2016 and September 2017. Participants were randomised 1:1 to CS or IS groups. The primary outcome was suture time, measured intraoperatively. Secondary outcomes included postoperative complications, morbidity, and mortality up to 30 days, and survival. Randomisation was achieved using block randomisation with allocation concealment via sealed envelopes. Blinding was applied to patients and outcome assessors, but not to surgeons.\n\nResults: Eighty patients received the allocated intervention (41 CS, 39 IS). The CS group had a significantly shorter suture time (median 12.0 minutes, IQR 10.0–17.0) compared to the IS group (median 22.4 minutes, IQR 15.0–28.0; OR 1.26, 95% CI 1.13 to 1.40; P < 0.001). Biliary complications, including bile leakage, were similar between groups (CS: 6/41, 14.6%; IS: 4/39, 10.3%; P = 0.738). No anastomotic stenosis was observed in either group. Mortality and other adverse events were comparable between groups, with one death in the CS group due to pneumonia and multi-organ failure.\n\nInterpretation: Continuous suture for BEA is faster and equally safe compared to interrupted suture, with no significant difference in biliary complications.\n\nTrial registration: NCT02658643.\n\nFunding: Not specified.",
