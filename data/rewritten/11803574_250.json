A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of the Thai Translation of the Aberdeen Varicose Vein Questionnaire\n\nBackground: This study aimed to translate the Aberdeen Varicose Vein Questionnaire into Thai (AVVQ-Thai) and evaluate its reliability, validity, and minimal clinically important differences (MCID) in patients with chronic venous disease (CVD).\n\nMethods: A multicenter prospective observational cohort study was conducted in four hospitals across Thailand from January 2019 to December 2021. Participants included adults with CEAP C2-C6 and truncal reflux. Venous interventions were performed, and outcomes were measured using AVVQ-Thai, VCSS, and EQ-5D pre- and one-month post-intervention. AVVQ-Thai was also collected one to two weeks after the initial visit. The primary outcome was the change in AVVQ-Thai scores.\n\nResults: A total of 119 patients were included. The AVVQ-Thai demonstrated good internal consistency (Cronbach’s alpha = 0.783) and moderate reliability (ICC = 0.67, 95% CI: 0.50, 0.79). Significant correlations with VCSS and EQ-5D indicated good construct and discriminative validity. Median AVVQ scores improved significantly post-intervention from 15.4 to 4.2 in C2-C3 and from 18.9 to 7.3 in C4-C6. The MCID was 6.21. No adverse events were reported.\n\nInterpretation: The AVVQ-Thai is a reliable and valid tool for assessing health outcomes in Thai patients with CVD. It is recommended for clinical application in Thailand.\n\nTrial registration: Not provided.\n\nFunding: Not specified.",
