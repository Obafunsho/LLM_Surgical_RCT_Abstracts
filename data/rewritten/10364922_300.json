A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Effect of Preoperative Physical Activity on Recovery after Breast Cancer Surgery: A Randomised Controlled Trial\n\nBackground: The effect of preoperative physical activity on recovery and complications after primary breast cancer surgery is unknown. This trial aimed to evaluate whether a recommendation for non-supervised physical activity improves recovery post-surgery.\n\nMethods: This parallel, unblinded, multicentre trial randomised women scheduled for breast cancer surgery. Participants were recruited from a university and a county hospital in western Sweden. Eligibility criteria included women aged 18 years or older, excluding those with stage IV breast cancer or who received neoadjuvant treatment. The intervention group received an individual recommendation for 30 minutes of daily aerobic physical activity before and 4 weeks after surgery. The control group received no physical activity advice. The primary outcome was patient-reported physical recovery at 4 weeks post-surgery. Secondary outcomes included mental recovery, complications, reoperations, and readmissions. Randomisation was performed using an online system with 1:1 allocation in permutated blocks. Neither participants nor outcome assessors were blinded.\n\nResults: Between November 2016 and December 2018, 400 patients were randomised (200 per group). At 4 weeks, 370 participants (180 intervention, 190 control) were analysed using an intention-to-treat approach. No significant difference was observed in physical recovery (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.13) or mental recovery (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.17). The mean Comprehensive Complication Index score was similar between groups (4.2 vs 4.7). Complications occurred in 15.6% of the intervention group and 18.4% of the control group within 30 days post-surgery.\n\nInterpretation: Recommended non-supervised physical activity before and after breast cancer surgery did not improve recovery at 4 weeks post-surgery.
