  "abstract": "Title: Randomised Controlled Trial of Sufentanil Sublingual Tablet System for Postoperative Pain Management\n\nBackground: This study evaluates the efficacy and safety of a sufentanil sublingual tablet system (SSTS) for managing postoperative pain following open abdominal surgery.\n\nMethods: This phase 3, randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial was conducted at 13 hospitals in the United States from March 2012 to January 2013. Eligible participants were adults undergoing open abdominal surgery. Patients were randomised 2:1 to receive SSTS 15 μg or placebo, with randomisation and allocation concealment via an interactive web-response system. Blinding included patients, investigators, and study personnel. The primary outcome was the time-weighted summed pain intensity difference (SPID) over 48 hours. Secondary outcomes included SPID and total pain relief (TOTPAR) up to 72 hours. A sample size of 180 was planned, with 172 randomised (115 to SSTS, 57 to placebo).\n\nResults: The SPID48 was significantly higher in the SSTS group than in the placebo group (least squares mean [SEM], 105.60 [10.14] vs 55.58 [13.11]; P = 0.001). SPID and TOTPAR scores were significantly higher in the SSTS group at all time points up to 72 hours (P < 0.05). Adverse events were similar between groups, with no severe events in the SSTS group.\n\nInterpretation: SSTS is effective and safe for managing postoperative pain in patients following open abdominal surgery.
