This study evaluates the efficacy of combining fluorescence-guided surgery (FGS) with photoimmunotherapy (PIT) using a fluorescent tumor-specific antibody.\n\nMethods: In this randomised controlled trial, 16 nude mice underwent surgical orthotopic implantation of the human pancreatic cancer cell line BxPC-3. An anti-CEACAM monoclonal antibody (6G5j) conjugated to the 700-nm dye IR700DyeDX was administered intravenously. Mice were randomised into FGS-only (n=8) and FGS + PIT (n=8) groups. Randomisation was performed using a computer-generated sequence, and allocation was concealed. The primary outcome was the rate of metastatic recurrence, assessed four weeks post-surgery. Blinding was not applied.\n\nResults: The metastatic recurrence rate was 100% in the FGS-only group and 25% in the FGS + PIT group (p=0.007). The average total recurrent tumor weight was 2370.3 ± 1907.8 mg for FGS-only and 705.5 ± 1200.0 mg for FGS + PIT (p=0.039). No adverse events were reported.\n\nInterpretation: Combining FGS with PIT significantly reduces pancreatic cancer recurrence. This approach may enhance surgical outcomes by improving tumor margin visualization and reducing recurrence rates.\n\nTrial registration: Not provided.\n\nFunding: Not specified.",
