A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Deep Brain Stimulation vs. Levodopa on Autonomic Nervous System Functions in Parkinson's Disease\n\nBackground: Dysfunctions of the autonomic nervous system (ANS) are prevalent in Parkinson's disease (PD). This study aimed to evaluate the effects of subthalamic nucleus (STN) deep brain stimulation on ANS functions compared to levodopa.\n\nMethods: This randomised controlled trial included 29 PD patients. Fourteen patients received STN stimulation, and 15 received levodopa. The primary outcome was the change in cardiovascular ANS functions, measured by blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR) during rest and orthostatic conditions, heart rate variability (HRV), and breathing-induced cutaneous sympathetic vasoconstriction (CVC). Randomisation was conducted using a computer-generated sequence, and allocation was concealed. Blinding was not applicable due to the nature of the interventions.\n\nResults: STN stimulation did not significantly affect cardiovascular ANS functions but significantly increased CVC. In contrast, levodopa significantly lowered BP and HR at rest and increased orthostatic hypotension. HRV, skin perfusion, and temperature increased after levodopa administration. No adverse events were reported in either group.\n\nInterpretation: STN stimulation has minor effects on autonomic functions compared to levodopa, which significantly alters cardiovascular parameters. Reduced levodopa intake post-STN stimulation may improve autonomic function in PD patients.\n\nTrial registration: [Trial registration number]\n\nFunding: [Source of funding]",
