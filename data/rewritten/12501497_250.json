This study aims to assess current surgical practices and willingness to participate in a randomized controlled trial (RCT).\n\nMethods: An online survey was conducted among consultant congenital cardiac surgeons in adult congenital centres across the United Kingdom and Ireland. The survey collected data on preferred prostheses, decision-making factors, surgical techniques, postoperative management, and willingness to randomize patients to different prostheses in a trial.\n\nResults: Of 39 surgeons, 27 (69%) responded. Nineteen (70%) preferred an Edwards bovine pericardial valve, with the Inspiris Resilia model being the most common choice (7, 26%). Only 2 (7%) preferred the Hancock II valve, while 6 (22%) opted for pulmonary homografts. Long-term freedom from reintervention was the primary factor influencing prosthesis choice (23, 85%). A total of 22 (81%) surgeons were willing to randomize adult patients to either a bovine pericardial valve or a porcine xenograft, with Perimount Magna Ease and Hancock II being the most acceptable options. Willingness to randomize decreased to 11 (41%) for adolescent patients.\n\nInterpretation: The survey highlights heterogeneity in prosthesis selection and supports the feasibility of a pragmatic, multicentre RCT comparing bovine pericardial and porcine xenograft valves for PVR in adults. This trial could provide essential evidence to guide clinical practice and improve patient outcomes.",
