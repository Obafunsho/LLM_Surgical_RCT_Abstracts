A 250-word version\n\nTitle: A Randomised Controlled Trial of Decision Aids for Hip and Knee Osteoarthritis\n\nBackground: This study aimed to compare the effectiveness of two decision aids (DAs) for patients with hip or knee osteoarthritis in making informed patient-centered decisions regarding surgery.\n\nMethods: A multisite 2 × 2 factorial randomised trial was conducted at three sites involving 1,636 patients. Participants were randomly assigned to receive either a long, detailed DA or a short, interactive DA. Eight surgeons were randomly assigned to receive a patient preference report or administer usual care. The primary outcome was the rate of informed patient-centered decisions, measured before and after the surgeon visit. Randomisation was stratified by site, and allocation was concealed. Neither participants nor clinicians were blinded, but the statistician was.\n\nResults: A total of 1,220 pre-visit and 967 post-visit surveys were returned. The mean age of participants was 65 years, with 57% female and 67% having knee osteoarthritis. The informed decision rate was 67.2%, with no significant difference between DA groups (p = 0.97) or surgeon groups (p = 0.23). Knowledge scores were higher in the short-DA group (mean difference = 9%; p < 0.001). Surgery was performed in 60.5% of cases within six months, with no significant difference by group. Surgeons reported high satisfaction and normal visit duration.\n\nInterpretation: The short DA was more effective in improving knowledge, while both DAs were comparable in other outcomes. The trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02729831). Funding sources were not specified.",
