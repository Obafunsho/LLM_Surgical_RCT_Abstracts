A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Virtual Reality vs. Noninteractive Visual Distraction in Pediatric Orthopaedic Procedures\n\nBackground: This randomised controlled trial aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of virtual reality (VR) gaming simulation compared to noninteractive visual distraction (VR goggles or tablet video) in reducing pain and anxiety in pediatric patients undergoing in-office orthopaedic procedures.\n\nMethods: Conducted at a single urban tertiary institution, the study included children scheduled for cast or percutaneous pin removal. Participants were randomly assigned to one of three groups: VR gaming simulation, VR goggles with a noninteractive video, or a tablet computer with the same video. The primary outcomes were preprocedure-to-maximum heart rate increase and preprocedure to postprocedure visual analog scale (VAS) scores for pain and anxiety. Randomisation was performed using a computer-generated sequence, and allocation was concealed. Blinding was not specified.\n\nResults: A total of 235 patients were enrolled, with 210 included in the final analysis. No significant differences were found between groups in heart rate increase or VAS scores for pain and anxiety in both cast and pin removal cohorts. The largest mean differences were -6 bpm (95% CI -16 to 3; p = 0.36) for heart rate and 1 point (95% CI 0 to 3; p = 0.13) for VAS pain.\n\nInterpretation: Simple distraction techniques like tablet video viewing are as effective as VR in minimizing procedural pain and anxiety. No adverse events were reported. Trial registration and funding details were not provided.",
