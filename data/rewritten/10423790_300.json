This study evaluates the efficacy and safety of antithrombotic regimens in preventing major cardiovascular events, vascular limb events, and mortality in PAD patients.\n\nMethods: A systematic review and network meta-analysis (NMA) of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) was conducted. Participants included individuals with PAD, defined by symptoms, previous procedures, or objective evidence of malperfusion. The intervention involved various antithrombotic regimens compared to placebo or other regimens. The primary outcome was a composite of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) and major adverse limb events (MALE) over the longest reported follow-up. Randomisation and allocation concealment methods were not specified. Blinding details were not provided. Data were extracted and analysed using intention-to-treat principles. The study was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42023389262).\n\nResults: The NMA included RCTs with varying sample sizes. The primary outcome showed a significant reduction in MACE and MALE with certain antithrombotic regimens. Adverse events, including major bleeding, were reported, with varying frequencies across regimens. The analysis revealed that some regimens were more effective in specific subgroups, such as those with chronic limb-threatening ischaemia. The study's findings were evaluated using the Grading of Recommendation Assessment, Development and Evaluation framework.\n\nInterpretation: The findings suggest that specific antithrombotic regimens can effectively reduce cardiovascular and limb events in PAD patients, although bleeding risks vary. The results highlight the need for tailored treatment strategies based on individual patient characteristics. Further research is needed to refine treatment recommendations and address gaps in current guidelines.\n\nFunding: The study's funding source was not specified.",
