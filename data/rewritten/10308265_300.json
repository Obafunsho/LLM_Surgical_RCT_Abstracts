A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Therapeutic Plasma Exchange in Cardiac Surgery Patients with Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia\n\nBackground: Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) presents a challenge in cardiac surgery requiring cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) due to the need for anticoagulation. This study assesses the efficacy of intraoperative therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) in reducing thromboembolic events, bleeding, and mortality in HIT patients undergoing CPB.\n\nMethods: Conducted at a tertiary care center, this randomised controlled trial included patients diagnosed with HIT requiring cardiac surgery with CPB. Participants were randomised to receive TPE with heparin re-exposure or standard care. The primary outcome was the incidence of HIT-related thromboembolic events within 7 days post-surgery. Secondary outcomes included bleeding and mortality within 30 days. Randomisation was computer-generated, and allocation was concealed using sealed envelopes. Due to the intervention's nature, blinding was not feasible.\n\nResults: A total of 24 patients were randomised, with 12 in each group. Three patients (12.5%) died within 30 days post-surgery, none of which were HIT-related. Thromboembolic events occurred in 3 patients, with 2 possibly HIT-related. The effect size for thromboembolic events was not statistically significant (p > 0.05). No significant differences in bleeding or mortality were observed between groups. Adverse events were similar across groups, with no severe complications reported.\n\nInterpretation: TPE with heparin re-exposure did not significantly increase HIT-related thromboembolic events or mortality in cardiac surgery patients with CPB. These findings suggest TPE may be a safe adjunct in managing HIT during cardiac surgery. Further studies with larger sample sizes are warranted to confirm these results.\n\nTrial registration: [Trial registration number]\n\nFunding: [Source of funding]",
