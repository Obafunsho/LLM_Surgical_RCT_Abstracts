This study evaluates the efficacy and safety of tirofiban combined with heparin as an alternative anticoagulation strategy.\n\nMethods: This single-center, randomised controlled trial included patients with HIT requiring CPB. Participants were randomly assigned to receive either tirofiban with heparin or standard anticoagulation. The primary outcome was the incidence of thrombotic events during and after surgery, measured over a 30-day period. Randomisation was computer-generated, and allocation was concealed using sealed envelopes. Blinding was not feasible due to the nature of the intervention.\n\nResults: A total of 50 participants were randomised: 25 to the tirofiban with heparin group and 25 to the control group. Analysis was conducted on an intention-to-treat basis. The tirofiban group showed a reduced incidence of thrombotic events (12% vs. 28%, p=0.04). Adverse events included bleeding complications, occurring in 16% of the tirofiban group and 20% of the control group.\n\nInterpretation: Tirofiban combined with heparin is a viable alternative anticoagulation strategy for HIT-positive patients undergoing CPB, reducing thrombotic events without significantly increasing bleeding risk. Further studies are needed to confirm these findings.\n\nTrial registration: NCT12345678\n\nFunding: This study was funded by the National Institutes of Health.",
