Participants were randomised 2:1 to receive PLX-PAD or placebo, with 30 intramuscular injections administered into the index leg on days 0 and 60. The primary outcome was AFS, defined as the time from randomisation to major amputation or death, assessed over 12-36 months. Randomisation used permuted blocks, and allocation was concealed via an interactive web-based system. Blinding included patients, clinicians, and outcome assessors.\n\nResults: From September 2017 to November 2020, 143 patients were randomised to PLX-PAD and 70 to placebo, with 205 patients analysed using an intention-to-treat approach. Baseline characteristics were balanced. The probability of major amputation or death was similar between PLX-PAD and placebo groups (HR 0.93, 95% CI 0.53 to 1.63; P = 0.788). Adverse events occurred in 73.5% of PLX-PAD and 82.6% of placebo patients, primarily expected events such as skin ulcer and gangrene. A post hoc analysis revealed improved 12-month AFS in patients with a baseline HbA1c <6.5% (HR 0.46, 0.21 to 0.99; P = 0.048).\n\nInterpretation: While PLX-PAD did not enhance AFS in the overall cohort, it showed potential benefit in patients with well-controlled diabetes, suggesting the need for further studies.
