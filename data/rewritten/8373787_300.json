A 300-word version\n\nTitle: A Randomised Controlled Trial of Surgical vs. Medical Treatment for Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: Long-term Patient Reported Outcomes\n\nBackground: The STAMPEDE trial aimed to evaluate the long-term effects of surgical and medical treatments on patient-reported outcomes (PROs) in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and obesity.\n\nMethods: This randomised controlled trial involved 104 participants from the STAMPEDE trial, who completed RAND-36, EQ-5D-3L, and a diabetes-specific instrument at baseline and annually for 5 years. Participants were randomised to Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB), sleeve gastrectomy (SG), or intensive medical therapy (IMT). Randomisation was computer-generated, and allocation was concealed. Blinding details were not specified.\n\nResults: A total of 104 participants were randomised: 35 to RYGB, 35 to SG, and 34 to IMT. All participants were included in the analysis using an intention-to-treat approach. RYGB and SG significantly improved physical functioning, general health perception, energy/fatigue, and diabetes-related QoL compared to IMT. No significant differences were observed in psychological and social QoL aspects. Multivariable analysis identified baseline general health, insulin independence, RYGB, and SG as independent factors for improved general health perception. No significant adverse events were reported.\n\nInterpretation: Metabolic surgery, specifically RYGB and SG, is associated with long-term improvements in physical health and diabetes-related PROs compared to IMT in T2DM patients. However, psychosocial well-being requires further attention post-surgery.\n\nTrial registration: [Trial registration number]\n\nFunding: [Source of funding]",
