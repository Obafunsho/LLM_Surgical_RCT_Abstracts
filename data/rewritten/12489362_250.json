A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Adherence to Prehabilitation in Randomised Controlled Trials: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis\n\nBackground: Prehabilitation is hypothesized to optimize postoperative outcomes, but adherence remains challenging. This study aimed to synthesize adherence measurement and reporting, estimate adherence rates, identify factors associated with adherence, and report barriers and facilitators.\n\nMethods: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) involving adults undergoing major elective surgery and allocated to prehabilitation programs. Searches were conducted in Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Web of Science, and Cochrane CENTRAL until April 10, 2024. The primary outcome was adherence to prehabilitation, measured continuously or dichotomously. Random-effects meta-analysis and meta-regression were used to evaluate adherence rates and predictors. Qualitative synthesis was informed by the Theoretical Domains Framework.\n\nResults: We included 105 RCTs (n=4941 participants). Pooled adherence was 79% (95% CI 70–88; I²=95.4%). Only patient age was significantly associated with adherence (OR 0.95 per year older, 95% CI 0.91–0.99). Common barriers included logistical issues and health conditions, while facilitators included supervision by specialists and personalisation.\n\nInterpretation: Adherence to prehabilitation is variable, necessitating standardisation in reporting. Age was the only significant predictor of adherence, but qualitative insights into barriers and facilitators can inform program design. No adverse events were reported. The study was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42024518851) and funded by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research.",
