This study aimed to assess the association between intra-operative mechanical power and PPCs.\n\nMethods: This post hoc analysis of a randomised controlled trial was conducted at a university-affiliated tertiary hospital in Melbourne, Australia, from February 2015 to February 2019. Adult patients undergoing major noncardiothoracic, nonintracranial surgery were randomised to receive either low tidal volume (6 ml/kg predicted body weight) or conventional tidal volume (10 ml/kg predicted body weight) ventilation. The primary outcome was the incidence of PPCs within the first seven postoperative days. Randomisation was computer-generated, and allocation was concealed. Outcome assessors were blinded to group allocation. A total of 1236 patients were randomised, with 1156 included in the final analysis using an intention-to-treat approach.\n\nResults: Median mechanical power adjusted by respiratory system compliance was 0.32 (J min−1)/(ml cmH2O−1). Higher mechanical power was independently associated with increased risk of PPCs (OR 1.34, 95% CI 1.17 to 1.52; p < 0.001) and acute respiratory failure (OR 1.40, 95% CI 1.21 to 1.61; p < 0.001). No significant adverse events were reported.\n\nInterpretation: Intra-operative exposure to higher mechanical power is associated with increased risk of PPCs and acute respiratory failure in patients undergoing major surgery. These findings suggest the need for controlled studies to explore reducing mechanical power during surgery. The study provides a rationale for future trials aimed at decreasing mechanical power to improve postoperative outcomes.\n\nTrial registration: ANZCTR: ACTRN12614000790640.\n\nFunding: The study was funded by institutional sources.",
