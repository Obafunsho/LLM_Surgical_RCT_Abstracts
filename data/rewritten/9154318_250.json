The primary outcomes were maximum pain intensity within 48 hours post-surgery (superiority) and severe bleeding requiring surgical re-intervention within 7 days (non-inferiority). Randomisation was centre-stratified with variable block sizes, and allocation was concealed via a web-based tool. No blinding was implemented.\n\nResults: From May 2017 to November 2020, 754 patients were randomised (366 intervention, 359 control). The intervention group reported lower median pain intensity (5, i.q.r. 3–7) compared to the control group (6, i.q.r. 4–7), P < 0.001. Severe bleeding occurred in 1.1% of patients in both groups, with a non-inferiority margin of −0.03% (90% CI −1.47% to +1.41%). Adverse events were similar between groups.\n\nInterpretation: Omitting tamponade dressings reduces postoperative pain without increasing severe bleeding risk. Trial registration: DRKS00011590.
