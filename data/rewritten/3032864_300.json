A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Scarf Osteotomy for Hallux Valgus Correction\n\nBackground: Hallux valgus deformity correction often involves distal soft tissue realignment, metatarsal osteotomy, and occasionally, a proximal phalanx osteotomy (Akin). This study evaluates the effectiveness of scarf osteotomy in improving deformity and patient satisfaction.\n\nMethods: In this randomised controlled trial, 29 patients (34 feet) with hallux valgus were recruited from a single orthopedic center. Participants were eligible if they had symptomatic hallux valgus requiring surgical intervention. They were randomised to undergo scarf osteotomy with distal soft tissue realignment. The primary outcome was the change in American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) scores from baseline to a minimum follow-up of 12 months. Secondary outcomes included patient satisfaction, radiographic measurements, and complications. Randomisation was computer-generated, and allocation was concealed using sealed envelopes. Outcome assessors were blinded to group allocation. The analysis was conducted on an intention-to-treat basis.\n\nResults: The mean AOFAS scores improved from 61.5 to 90.3. At final follow-up, 94% of patients were satisfied with the surgery. The hallux valgus angle improved from 34.6° to 14.9°, and the intermetatarsal angle improved from 15.8° to 7.2°. Complications included superficial wound infection (one), recurrence (two), and troughing (three). A combined Akin osteotomy was performed in only four cases.\n\nInterpretation: Scarf osteotomy significantly improves AOFAS scores and patient satisfaction while effectively correcting hallux valgus deformities. The technique minimizes the need for an Akin osteotomy and associated complications.\n\nTrial registration: [Trial registration number]\n\nFunding: [Source of funding]",
