The primary outcome was the incremental cost-utility ratio (ICUR), expressed as cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained, over a 2-year period. Randomisation was performed using a computer-generated sequence with allocation concealment. Due to the nature of the intervention, blinding was not feasible. A total of 200 participants were randomised: 100 to early surgery and 100 to nonoperative care, with analysis conducted on an intention-to-treat basis. The study was conducted at a single tertiary care center.\n\nResults: Patients undergoing early surgery incurred higher costs (CAD 4118) compared to those receiving nonoperative care (CAD 2377) but achieved superior health outcomes (1.48 QALYs vs. 1.30 QALYs). The ICUR was CAD 5822 per QALY gained. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis indicated a 0.99 likelihood of cost-effectiveness at a willingness-to-pay threshold of CAD 50,000. No significant adverse events were reported in either group.\n\nInterpretation: Early surgical intervention for chronic lumbar radiculopathy is cost-effective compared to nonoperative care. This finding supports the allocation of resources for timely surgical access in single-payer healthcare systems. Future research should focus on the societal costs and clinical effectiveness of chronic radiculopathy treatments, considering occupational absences and lost productivity.\n\nTrial registration: [Trial registration number]\n\nFunding: [Source of funding]",
