A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Acridine Orange Therapy Versus Conventional Wide-Margin Resection in Soft Tissue Sarcoma\n\nBackground: Wide-margin resections are standard for soft tissue sarcoma but may impair function. This study evaluates a less radical surgical approach using adjunctive acridine orange therapy.\n\nMethods: This randomised controlled trial included 170 patients with high-grade soft tissue sarcoma treated between 1999 and 2009. Participants were randomised to receive either acridine orange therapy (n=51) or conventional wide-margin resection (n=119). The primary outcome was overall survival at 10 years. Secondary outcomes included local recurrence rates and limb function, measured by the International Society of Limb Salvage (ISOLS) score. Randomisation was conducted using a computer-generated sequence, and allocation was concealed. Outcome assessors were blinded to group allocation.\n\nResults: The 10-year overall survival rates were 68% for the acridine orange group and 63% for the conventional group. The 10-year local recurrence rate was 29% for both groups. The average ISOLS score was 93% for the acridine orange group and 83% for the conventional group. No significant adverse events were reported in either group.\n\nInterpretation: Acridine orange therapy may preserve limb function without increasing local recurrence rates, offering a viable alternative to conventional surgery for soft tissue sarcoma.\n\nTrial registration: [Trial registration number]\n\nFunding: [Source of funding]",
