A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Fluorescence Angiography in Colorectal Surgery\n\nBackground: Anastomotic leak is a critical complication in colorectal surgery, with incidences of 8.1% in right colectomies and up to 17.1% in low anterior resections. This study aims to assess the impact of fluorescence angiography on anastomotic leak and postoperative morbidity.\n\nMethods: A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials were performed. Studies comparing fluorescence angiography with standard care were included. The primary outcome was the rate of anastomotic leak, assessed within 30 to 90 days post-surgery. Randomisation methods and allocation concealment were not detailed. Blinding of outcome assessors, patients, and clinicians was not specified.\n\nResults: Out of 477 identified studies, 8 were included, comprising 3999 patients. Fluorescence angiography significantly reduced anastomotic leak rates, with an odds ratio of 0.64 (95% CI: 0.39–0.98, p < 0.0001) and a risk reduction of 4 percentage points. In colorectal anastomosis, the effect was consistent (OR 0.59, 95% CI 0.44–0.79, p < 0.0005). No significant reduction in postoperative morbidity was observed. Adverse events were not reported.\n\nInterpretation: The use of fluorescence angiography significantly decreases anastomotic leak rates in colorectal surgery but does not significantly affect postoperative morbidity. These findings suggest a beneficial role for fluorescence angiography in reducing anastomotic leaks, although further research is needed to explore its impact on other outcomes.\n\nTrial registration: Prospero 1055070.\n\nFunding: No funding was reported.",
