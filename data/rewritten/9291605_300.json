A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Hydroxyethyl Starch vs. Albumin in Cardiac Surgery\n\nBackground: The impact of third-generation hydroxyethyl starch (HES) on kidney function and haemostasis in cardiac surgery is unclear. This study evaluated whether intra-operative HES administration affects these outcomes compared to human albumin.\n\nMethods: Conducted at the Cleveland Clinic, this single-centre, triple-blinded, parallel-group, randomised, non-inferiority trial included patients aged 40–85 undergoing elective aortic valve replacement, with or without coronary artery bypass grafting, from June 2015 to February 2018. Participants were randomised 1:1 to receive 6% HES 130/0.4 or 5% human albumin. Randomisation was performed using a secure web-based system, with allocation concealment. The primary outcome was urinary neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) concentrations, measured at baseline, 1 hour, and 24 hours post-surgery.\n\nResults: Of 149 eligible patients, 141 were analysed (69 HES, 72 albumin). Postoperative NGAL was slightly lower with HES (median 5 ng/ml) vs. albumin (median 5 ng/ml), but not non-inferior [ratio of geometric means 0.91, 95% CI 0.57 to 1.44; p = 0.15]. Urinary interleukin-18 concentrations were reduced, but not non-inferior. Nine of 11 coagulation measures were non-inferior. No significant adverse events were reported.\n\nInterpretation: HES administration during cardiac surgery resulted in similar observed effects on kidney function and haemostasis compared to albumin, though greater variability precluded non-inferiority conclusions. Long-term kidney function and mortality were comparable between groups.\n\nTrial registration: NCTXXXXX\n\nFunding: Supported by [Funding Source].",
