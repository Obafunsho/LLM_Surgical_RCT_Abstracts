This study assesses the response of leg muscle, whole-body muscle, and non-muscle protein to amino acid signaling in pediatric burn patients 6 months post-injury.\n\nMethods: In this randomised controlled trial, 10 pediatric burn patients (7.4 ± 3.8 years; 27.4 ± 14.7 kg) and 5 healthy young males (22 ± 3 years; 76 ± 15 kg) as controls were included. Participants underwent an 8-hour stable isotope infusion study, with a 3-hour amino acid solution infusion (10% Travasol). Femoral arterial and venous blood samples and muscle biopsies were collected. The primary outcome was the leg muscle protein synthesis rate, measured during the infusion period. Randomisation and allocation concealment methods were not specified. Blinding details were not provided. The study setting and participant eligibility criteria were not detailed.\n\nResults: Amino acid infusion significantly increased leg muscle protein synthesis in both groups (P < 0.05). In burn patients, protein breakdown increased nonsignificantly, resulting in a negative net balance. In controls, protein breakdown decreased nonsignificantly, leading to a significant increase in net balance (P < 0.05). Whole-body protein breakdown was significantly higher in burn patients. No adverse events were reported.\n\nInterpretation: Pediatric burn patients exhibit unresponsive leg muscle protein net deposition to amino acid infusion and higher whole-body protein breakdown compared to controls. These findings suggest the need for tailored nutritional strategies to improve protein metabolism in burn patients. Further research is warranted to optimize post-burn injury interventions.\n\nTrial registration: Not provided.\n\nFunding: Not specified.",
