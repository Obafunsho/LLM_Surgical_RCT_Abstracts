The primary outcome was the duration of analgesia, measured from the block's performance to the first analgesic request. Nine trials with 546 patients were included. Randomisation and allocation concealment methods varied across trials. Blinding of outcome assessors, patients, and clinicians was inconsistently reported.\n\nResults: Perineural dexamethasone increased the duration of analgesia from 19.54 to 22.27 hours, with a mean difference of 2.73 hours (95% CI 1.07 to 4.38; p = 0.001; I² = 87). No significant differences were found in secondary outcomes related to efficacy and side effects. Adverse events were not consistently reported. The quality of evidence was moderate due to serious inconsistency.\n\nInterpretation: Perineural dexamethasone is superior to intravenous dexamethasone in prolonging analgesia duration, but the clinical relevance is questionable. The perineural route remains off-label. Trial registration: PROSPERO CRD 42023442453. Funding sources were not specified.",
