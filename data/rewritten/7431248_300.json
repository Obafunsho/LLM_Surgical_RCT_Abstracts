A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Virtual Reality in Surgical Training: A Randomised Controlled Trial\n\nBackground: This randomised controlled trial assessed the impact of virtual reality (VR) simulation on the training of medical students in intramedullary tibial nailing, a procedure requiring complex motor skills.\n\nMethods: Conducted at a medical school, 25 first- and second-year students without prior experience in the procedure were randomly assigned to three groups: technique guide control (n = 8), VR group (n = 8), or VR and technique guide group (n = 9). The primary outcome was the successful completion of the procedure, defined as correct placement of the nail and screw, evaluated by a blinded orthopaedic surgeon. Procedural accuracy was assessed by the number of incorrect steps out of 16. Randomisation was achieved using a computer-generated sequence, with allocation concealment ensured. Participants in the VR groups underwent three simulation sessions over 10 to 14 days.\n\nResults: A greater proportion of participants in the VR group (6 of 8) and the VR and technique guide group (7 of 9) completed the procedure compared to the technique guide group (2 of 8; p = 0.01). Procedural accuracy was higher in the VR groups, with fewer incorrect steps (3.2 ± 0.1 and 3.1 ± 0.1) than the technique guide group (5.7 ± 0.2; p = 0.02). No adverse events were reported.\n\nInterpretation: VR simulation significantly enhanced both the completion rate and procedural accuracy compared to traditional technique guides. These results indicate that VR could be a valuable tool in surgical education, warranting further investigation into its integration into residency training.\n\nTrial registration: Not provided.\n\nFunding: Not disclosed.",
