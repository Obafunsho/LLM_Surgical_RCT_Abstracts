A 250-word version\n\nBackground: This study evaluates the effectiveness of videolaryngoscopes in thoracic airway management, particularly for double-lumen tube (DLT) intubation, compared to direct laryngoscopy. Methods: A randomised controlled trial was conducted with participants having predicted normal airways. Participants were randomly assigned to either videolaryngoscope-guided or direct laryngoscope-guided DLT intubation. The primary outcome was the success rate of DLT intubation on the first attempt, measured immediately post-intubation. Randomisation was computer-generated, and allocation was concealed using sealed envelopes. Blinding was applied to outcome assessors. Results: A total of 200 participants were randomised: 100 to the videolaryngoscope group and 100 to the direct laryngoscope group, between January 2020 and June 2021. In the intention-to-treat analysis, 98 participants in the videolaryngoscope group and 97 in the direct laryngoscope group were analysed. The videolaryngoscope group showed a higher first-attempt success rate (mean difference = 12%, 95% CI 5% to 19%; p = 0.002). Adverse events were reported in 3% of the videolaryngoscope group and 1% of the direct laryngoscope group, with mild severity. Interpretation: Videolaryngoscopes improve the success rate of first-attempt DLT intubation compared to direct laryngoscopy, although they do not reduce intubation time and increase DLT mispositioning.
