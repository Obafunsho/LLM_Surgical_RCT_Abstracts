A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial on the Effects of Neuromuscular Blocking Agents in Neurosurgical Procedures\n\nBackground: Neuromuscular blocking agents are critical in managing intracranial pressure during neurosurgical procedures. This study evaluates the effects of succinylcholine and atracurium on intracranial pressure.\n\nMethods: This randomised controlled trial was conducted at a tertiary care hospital. Participants were adult patients aged 18-65 undergoing neurosurgery, with no history of neuromuscular disorders. Participants were randomly assigned to receive either succinylcholine or atracurium. Randomisation was computer-generated, and allocation was concealed using sealed envelopes. Blinding was applied to outcome assessors and patients.\n\nObjective: To compare the effects of succinylcholine and atracurium on intracranial pressure.\n\nOutcome: The primary outcome was the change in intracranial pressure measured intraoperatively over a 2-hour period.\n\nResults: A total of 200 participants were randomised, with 100 in each group, between January 2020 and June 2021. Analysis was conducted on 98 participants in the succinylcholine group and 97 in the atracurium group using an intention-to-treat approach. The mean difference in intracranial pressure was 2.5 mm Hg (95% CI 1.0 to 4.0; p = 0.03) favoring atracurium. Adverse events were reported in 5% of the succinylcholine group and 3% of the atracurium group, with no severe events.\n\nHarm: Mild adverse events included transient hypotension and bradycardia, with no significant difference between groups.\n\nTrial registration: NCT12345678\n\nFunding: This study was funded by the National Institute of Health.\n\nInterpretation: Atracurium is associated with a more favorable profile in managing intracranial pressure compared to succinylcholine, with fewer adverse events. Further research is needed to confirm these findings in larger populations.",
