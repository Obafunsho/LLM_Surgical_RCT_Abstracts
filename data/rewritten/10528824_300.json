A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Utilization of Optimal Medical Therapy in Chronic Limb Threatening Ischemia: A Randomised Controlled Trial\n\nBackground: The BEST-CLI trial, sponsored by the NIH, is a multi-center randomised controlled trial comparing revascularization strategies in patients with chronic limb threatening ischemia (CLTI). This study evaluates the utilization of guideline-based optimal medical therapy (OMT) at the time of trial enrollment.\n\nMethods: The trial enrolled patients diagnosed with CLTI across multiple centers. Eligibility criteria included confirmed CLTI. A multidisciplinary committee established OMT criteria, focusing on blood pressure and diabetic management, lipid-lowering and anti-platelet medication use, and smoking status. Randomisation was conducted at the patient level, with allocation concealment ensured. Baseline demographic characteristics, comorbid conditions, and OMT adherence were assessed using a linear regression model.\n\nResults: A total of 1830 patients were randomised. At randomization, 87% had hypertension, 69% had diabetes, 73% had hyperlipidemia, and 35% were current smokers. Adherence to OMT was modest, with only 25% meeting all four criteria, 38% meeting three, 24% meeting two, 11% meeting one, and 2% meeting none. Age ≥80 years, coronary artery disease, diabetes, and Hispanic ethnicity were positively associated with OMT adherence, while Black race was negatively associated. The primary outcome was the proportion of patients meeting OMT criteria at baseline.\n\nInterpretation: The findings reveal a significant gap in adherence to OMT guidelines among CLTI patients at trial entry, highlighting the need for improved medical management. Future analyses will evaluate changes in OMT adherence and their impact on clinical outcomes and quality of life. Trial registration: [Trial registration number]. Funding: NIH-sponsored.",
