A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Pituitrin in Cardiac Surgery Patients with Pulmonary Hypertension\n\nBackground: Vasoplegic syndrome is a significant complication following cardiac surgery, especially in patients with pulmonary hypertension. This study investigates whether pituitrin, a vasopressin and oxytocin substitute, improves postoperative outcomes in these patients.\n\nMethods: This single-center, randomized, single-blind, parallel-group controlled trial was conducted at The First Affiliated Hospital of Shandong First Medical University, China. A total of 300 adult patients with pulmonary hypertension undergoing elective cardiac surgery were randomized to receive either continuous intravenous infusion of pituitrin at 0.04 U/(kg h) or normal saline. The primary outcome was a composite endpoint of all-cause mortality or common complications within 30 days post-surgery. Secondary outcomes included other postoperative complications and length of hospital stay. Randomization was computer-generated, with allocation concealed in opaque envelopes. Outcome assessors and patients were blinded.\n\nResults: The study enrolled 300 participants, with 150 in each group. Analysis was conducted on an intention-to-treat basis. The primary outcome's effect size and precision will be reported upon study completion. Adverse events, including mild gastrointestinal side effects, were monitored.\n\nInterpretation: Pituitrin may offer a promising approach to managing vasoplegic syndrome in cardiac surgery patients with pulmonary hypertension. Further results will elucidate its impact on postoperative outcomes.\n\nTrial registration: NCT05727618\n\nFunding: The study was funded by The First Hospital affiliated with Shandong First Medical University.",
