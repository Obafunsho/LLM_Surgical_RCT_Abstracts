A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Remimazolam vs. Propofol Anesthesia in Minor Hepatectomy\n\nBackground: This randomised controlled trial assessed the hemodynamic stability of remimazolam-based anesthesia compared to propofol-based anesthesia during minor hepatectomy under combined general and thoracic epidural anesthesia.\n\nMethods: Conducted at Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Center, 72 patients scheduled for elective minor hepatectomy were randomized 1:1 to receive either remimazolam (Group R) or propofol (Group P) anesthesia. The primary outcome was the hemodynamic instability score (HI-score) measured during induction, hepatectomy, and hemostasis phases. Randomization was performed using MinimPy2 software, with allocation concealment ensured. Blinding was applied to outcome assessors and data entry personnel. The sample size was calculated to detect a 15% reduction in HI-score with 80% power and a 5% significance level.\n\nResults: Of the 72 randomized, 66 patients were analyzed (33 per group) using a per-protocol approach. Group R exhibited significantly lower total HI-scores (22.8 ± 2.1) compared to Group P (33.0 ± 4.1, p = 0.029). HI-scores were also lower in Group R during induction (11.9 ± 1.0 vs. 22.6 ± 4.2, p = 0.017), hepatectomy (23.2 ± 3.2 vs. 38.5 ± 6.0, p = 0.027), and hemostasis (22.2 ± 2.8 vs. 33.5 ± 3.8, p = 0.019). No significant differences in major cardiovascular events or hospital stay were observed. Adverse events were not significantly different between groups.\n\nInterpretation: Remimazolam-based anesthesia provides superior intraoperative hemodynamic stability compared to propofol in minor hepatectomy, though this does not translate into improved perioperative outcomes.\n\nTrial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT06565715.\n\nFunding: Not specified.",
