A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial on Bilateral Internal Iliac Artery Preservation in Aortoiliac Aneurysms\n\nBackground: This study evaluates the safety and efficacy of preserving bilateral internal iliac arteries (IIAs) using iliac branch stent grafts (IBSG) in patients with aortoiliac aneurysms.\n\nMethods: Conducted at four tertiary hospitals in China, 265 patients with aortoiliac aneurysms were enrolled from June 2019 to February 2024. Participants were divided into groups based on aneurysm location and IIA preservation: Group BB (bilateral aneurysms with bilateral IBSG), Group BU (bilateral aneurysms with unilateral IBSG and contralateral IIA embolization), Group UB (unilateral aneurysm with bilateral IIA preservation), and Group UU (unilateral aneurysm with unilateral IIA preservation). Propensity score matching was used for comparison. The primary outcome was major adverse events, and the secondary outcome was pelvic ischemia.\n\nResults: After matching, 76 patients were in Group BB and BU, and 110 in Group UB and UU. In Group BB, 3 patients (7.9%) experienced IBSG occlusion, while 2 patients (5.3%) in Group BU did. Group BB had fewer cases of buttock claudication (1 vs. 10, p < 0.05) and decreased erectile function (2 vs. 12, p < 0.05) compared to Group BU. In Group UB, 1 patient (1.8%) experienced type I endoleak, and 4 patients (7.3%) underwent reintervention, compared to 1 patient (1.8%) in Group UU. Group UB had fewer cases of buttock claudication (1 vs. 13, p < 0.05) and decreased erectile function (2 vs. 14, p < 0.05) compared to Group UU. No aneurysm-related mortality was reported.\n\nInterpretation: Bilateral IIA preservation using IBSG demonstrates satisfactory midterm outcomes, reducing occlusion and reintervention rates while preserving ambulation and sexual function. This approach should be considered for patients meeting anatomical criteria.",
