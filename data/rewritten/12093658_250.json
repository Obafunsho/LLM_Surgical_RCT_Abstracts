A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Enhanced Recovery After Surgery Protocols in Colorectal Surgery\n\nBackground: Enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) protocols aim to minimize surgical stress and expedite recovery in colorectal surgery patients. This study evaluates the effectiveness of ERAS protocols compared to conventional care.\n\nMethods: This randomised controlled trial was conducted in multiple hospitals. Participants were adults undergoing elective colorectal surgery, with eligibility criteria including age 18-75 and ASA classification I-III. Randomisation was computer-generated, with allocation concealment via sealed envelopes. Blinding was applied to outcome assessors. The intervention group received ERAS protocols, while the control group received standard care. The primary outcome was the length of hospital stay (LOS), measured over 30 days post-surgery.\n\nResults: A total of 200 participants were randomised: 100 to the ERAS group and 100 to the control group, between January 2020 and June 2021. Analysis included 98 participants in the ERAS group and 97 in the control group, using an intention-to-treat approach. The ERAS group had a significantly shorter LOS (mean difference = 2.5 days, 95% CI 1.8 to 3.2; p < 0.001). Postoperative complications were lower in the ERAS group (15% vs. 25%, p = 0.04). No severe adverse events were reported.\n\nInterpretation: ERAS protocols significantly reduce LOS and postoperative complications in colorectal surgery patients. High compliance enhances outcomes, though implementation challenges remain. Future integration of prehabilitation and technology may further improve patient care.\n\nTrial registration: NCT01234567\n\nFunding: Supported by the National Institute of Health.",
