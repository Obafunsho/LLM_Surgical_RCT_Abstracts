This study aimed to evaluate the impact of revascularization on quality of life in affected patients.\n\nMethods: Conducted at the General and Vascular Surgery Outpatient Clinic and the Department of General and Vascular Surgery Clinic in Poznan, Poland, this study involved 122 patients aged 41 to 88 years with chronic lower limb ischemia. Exclusion criteria included previous lower limb amputation, lack of independence in movement, diabetes, acute ischemia, and stage IV disease. The Polish version of the Vascular Quality of Life Questionnaire (VascuQoL) was employed. Phase I involved all patients, Phase II included 88 patients qualified for revascularization, and Phase III assessed outcomes six months post-procedure. Randomisation and blinding details were not applicable as this was not a randomised trial.\n\nResults: The primary outcome was quality of life, assessed using VascuQoL. Post-revascularization, significant improvements were noted in all domains. Pain and limited physical activity were primary concerns. Age was inversely related to the \"symptoms\" subscale. Gender, marital status, education, and residence did not significantly influence outcomes. No adverse events were reported.\n\nInterpretation: The findings underscore the importance of educating patients on modifiable risk factors and adopting a multidisciplinary approach to management. The study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and approved by the Clinical Research Department of the Poznan University of Medical Sciences (reference number 37/2021). Funding details were not disclosed. The study highlights the need for continued patient education and individualized care strategies to improve quality of life in this population.",
