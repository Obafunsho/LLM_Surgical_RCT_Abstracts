A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of a Novel Surgeon-Placed Adductor Canal Block in Total Knee Arthroplasty\n\nBackground: Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) often requires effective pain management, traditionally involving opioids. This study evaluates a novel surgeon-placed adductor canal block (ACB) with catheter placement for continuous regional nerve block, aiming to reduce pain and opioid use post-TKA.\n\nMethods: This randomised controlled trial was conducted between July and November 2017, involving 56 consecutive patients undergoing primary TKA by a single surgeon. Participants were randomly assigned to receive either the novel ACB technique or a standard single-shot ACB by anesthesia. The primary outcome was perioperative pain measured by a visual analog scale (VAS) over seven days postoperatively. Randomisation was achieved through consecutive patient presentation, with no blinding of patients or clinicians.\n\nResults: Forty-eight patients initiated the survey, and 36 completed it. The novel ACB group showed a 25% reduction in VAS pain scores (3.9 to 2.9), a 24% reduction in opioid use, and significant reductions in side effects compared to the control group. No adverse events were reported in the novel ACB group.\n\nInterpretation: The surgeon-placed ACB technique demonstrated potential advantages in pain reduction and opioid use without adverse effects. Further studies are needed to confirm these findings. Trial registration and funding details were not provided.",
