The primary outcome was PNI, defined as >40% elevation in current perception threshold (CPT) from preoperative data, measured at 6 points on each leg preoperatively and at 1 week, 1 month, and 6 months postoperatively. Randomisation and allocation concealment methods were not applicable as this was not a randomised trial. Blinding was not implemented.\n\nResults: Significant CPT elevation was observed at the knee joint level (P = 0.01) and upper portion of the lower leg (P = 0.008) 1 week postoperatively. CPT decreased after 1 month and returned to baseline after 6 months. PNI occurred in 52% and 36% of patients at the knee joint level and upper portion of the lower leg, respectively. Microphlebectomy was associated with PNI (P <0.01). No major complications were reported.\n\nInterpretation: VV surgery using EVLA is less invasive, but transient PNI may occur early postoperatively, especially with concomitant microphlebectomy. Further studies are needed to confirm these findings.\n\nTrial registration: Not provided.\n\nFunding: None.",
