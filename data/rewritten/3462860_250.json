This study evaluates whether MIS TKA results in greater knee strength compared to standard TKA.\n\nMethods: This randomised controlled trial was conducted at a single center. Participants were adults eligible for TKA, matched for age, weight, height, BMI, sex, and surgically treated side. Fifty-two patients were randomised to receive either MIS or standard TKA. The primary outcome was knee extensor torque, measured preoperatively and at 8 weeks postoperatively using isokinetic tests. Randomisation was computer-generated, and allocation was concealed. Blinding was applied to outcome assessors.\n\nResults: Baseline extensor torques were 57 Nm for MIS and 53 Nm for standard TKA. At 8 weeks, mean postoperative extensor torques were 47 Nm for MIS and 45 Nm for standard TKA. The postoperative-to-preoperative ratios were 0.8 for both groups. The extensor-flexor torque ratios were similar. No significant differences were observed in knee scores, alignment, ROM, tourniquet and operating times, or hospital length of stay. Adverse events were not reported.\n\nInterpretation: MIS TKA does not significantly enhance postoperative quadriceps strength compared to standard TKA. The study was registered under trial number [insert trial registration number]. Funding was provided by [insert funding source].",
