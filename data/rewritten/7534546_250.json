A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Second-Generation HydroCoil Embolic System vs. Bare Platinum Coil in Intracranial Aneurysms\n\nBackground: Aneurysm recurrence post-coiling is linked to growth, (re)hemorrhage, and increased follow-up. The second-generation HydroCoil Embolic System (HES) aims to reduce recurrence by enhancing packing density and healing.\n\nMethods: This randomised, controlled trial enrolled 600 subjects with 3-14 mm ruptured or unruptured intracranial aneurysms across 46 centers in the US and Canada. Participants were randomised 1:1 to HES (n=297) or bare platinum coil (BPC, n=303) using stratified randomisation by site. The primary outcome was aneurysm recurrence on the Raymond-Roy scale over 24 months. Secondary outcomes included minor/major recurrence, packing density, adverse events, mortality, initial occlusion, retreatment, hemorrhage, and clinical outcome. Imaging assessors were blinded.\n\nResults: Recurrence occurred in 11 (4.4%) HES and 44 (15.4%) BPC subjects (OR 3.97, 95% CI [1.99, 7.92], p=0.002). Initial occlusion was higher with BPC, but HES showed better packing density and lower recurrence rates. Adverse events, retreatment, hemorrhage, mortality, and clinical outcomes were similar between groups.\n\nInterpretation: HES reduced recurrence without increased harm, supporting its use for embolizing small-to-medium intracranial aneurysms.\n\nTrial registration: NCT01407952\n\nFunding: MicroVention, Inc.",
