  "abstract": "Title: Randomised Controlled Trial of Intravenous Preemptive Analgesia in Vitreoretinal Surgery\n\nBackground: This randomised controlled trial aimed to evaluate the impact of intravenous preemptive analgesia (IPA) with cyclooxygenase-3 (COX-3) inhibitors on postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV), oculocardiac reflex (OCR), and oculoemetic reflex (OER) in patients undergoing vitreoretinal surgery (VRS) under general anesthesia (GA) with Adequacy of Anesthesia (AoA) guidance.\n\nMethods: A total of 165 patients scheduled for VRS at the Department of Ophthalmology, 5th Regional Hospital in Sosnowiec, were randomly assigned to receive AoA-guided GA combined with IPA at a single dose of 1 g of paracetamol, 2.5 g of metamizole, or both. Randomisation was conducted using sealed envelopes, and allocation was concealed. The primary outcome was the incidence of PONV, OCR, and OER, measured within 24 hours postoperatively. Blinding was applied to outcome assessors and patients. Data were collected from January 2018 to December 2022.\n\nResults: Of the 153 patients analyzed, PONV occurred in 4%, OCR in 10%, and OER in 0%. No significant differences were observed between groups regarding IPA type. PONV was observed in 2.11% of patients with zero, one, or two risk factors, compared to 27% with at least three risk factors. The analysis was per-protocol.\n\nInterpretation: IPA with both paracetamol and metamizole did not show a benefit over single use in reducing adverse events. PONV was minimal in patients with fewer risk factors. Trial registration: NCT03389243. Funding: Not specified.",
