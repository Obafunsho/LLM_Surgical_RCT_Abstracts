A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Interventions to Reduce Opioid Use After Orthopaedic Surgery\n\nBackground: Persistent opioid use following orthopaedic surgery is a significant concern. This study evaluates the effectiveness of interventions aimed at reducing opioid use post-surgery.\n\nMethods: We conducted a systematic review of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) from inception to November 2023. Eligible studies included adult patients undergoing orthopaedic surgery, with interventions implemented postoperatively. The primary outcome was the mean daily dose of opioid analgesics in morphine milligram equivalents (MME) at 1–3 months post-randomisation. Two reviewers independently screened studies, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool. Certainty of evidence was evaluated using GRADE. Meta-analysis was performed where appropriate.\n\nResults: Out of 17,471 records, 39 RCTs were included, involving 4054 participants. Multimodal analgesic interventions showed a lower mean daily opioid dose compared to placebo/no intervention/usual care or active control in the medium term. No significant differences were observed for other interventions. The certainty of evidence ranged from low to moderate. Adverse events were reported in 17 studies, with no significant differences between groups.\n\nInterpretation: Multimodal analgesic interventions may effectively reduce opioid use in the medium term post-orthopaedic surgery. However, high heterogeneity and low certainty of evidence limit definitive conclusions. Further research is needed to identify effective strategies.\n\nTrial registration: PROSPERO CRD42022357577.\n\nFunding: Not specified.",
