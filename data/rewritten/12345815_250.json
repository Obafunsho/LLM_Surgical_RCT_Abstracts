This study evaluates the cost-effectiveness of rubber band ligation (RBL) versus hemorrhoidectomy for grade III hemorrhoids.\n\nMethods: This multicenter, randomised controlled trial involved 79 adults with symptomatic grade III hemorrhoids, conducted in 10 Dutch hospitals. Participants were randomly assigned to RBL (n=46) or hemorrhoidectomy (n=33) from September 2019 to November 2022. The primary outcomes were cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained and cost per recurrence avoided over 24 months. Randomisation was computer-generated, with allocation concealment. Blinding was not applied.\n\nResults: Hemorrhoidectomy resulted in a QALY difference of 0.08 (95% CI, 0.06–0.16; p=0.034) and a recurrence difference of 33.5% (95% CI, 15.3%–51.7%; p=0.002). Hospital costs were higher for hemorrhoidectomy (€1364; 95% CI, 895–1834; p<0.001), as were societal costs (€1984; 95% CI, –132 to 4101; p=0.066). The incremental cost-utility ratio was €24,042 per QALY gained, and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was €5918 per recurrence avoided. No adverse events were reported.\n\nInterpretation: Hemorrhoidectomy offers better clinical outcomes but is more costly. Its cost-effectiveness depends on societal willingness-to-pay thresholds. Caution is advised before discarding it as a first-line treatment based solely on costs.\n\nTrial registration: NCT04621695\n\nFunding: Not specified.",
