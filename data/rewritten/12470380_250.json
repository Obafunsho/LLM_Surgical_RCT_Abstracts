This study evaluates the effect of transversus abdominis plane (TAP) blocks on peri-operative pain management in kidney transplant recipients.\n\nMethods: This retrospective study was conducted at Wellstar MCG, Augusta University, Georgia, USA. A total of 100 adult patients undergoing deceased donor kidney transplant were included, excluding those with opioid dependence. Patients were divided into two groups: Group A received ultrasound-guided TAP blocks, and Group B did not. The primary outcome was the use of intra-operative and post-operative analgesia up to 24 hours post-surgery. Data were analyzed using chi-square and Fisher’s exact tests.\n\nResults: Fifty patients were included in each group. Group A showed a statistically significant reduction in intra-operative fentanyl use (p = 0.04). No significant differences were observed in post-operative hydromorphone (p = 0.665), oxycodone (p = 0.75), or acetaminophen (p = 0.64) use. No differences were found in post-operative nausea (p = 0.766), vomiting (p = 0.436), or pruritus. No complications were recorded from TAP block use.\n\nInterpretation: TAP blocks are a safe approach for reducing intra-operative opioid use in kidney transplant recipients, though they do not affect post-operative analgesic requirements or side effects within 24 hours post-surgery. Further randomized controlled trials are needed to confirm these findings.",
