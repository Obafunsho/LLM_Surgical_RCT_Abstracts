  "abstract": "2. A 300-word version\n\nBackground: Stroke is a leading cause of long-term disability, with MRI being pivotal in understanding neuroplasticity. This study aimed to evaluate the intellectual and conceptual foundations of MRI-based neuroplasticity research in stroke through a bibliometric analysis.\n\nMethods: A comprehensive search of Scopus was conducted for publications from January 2004 to December 2024. Eligible studies included original articles and reviews assessing neuroplasticity in stroke using MRI. Citation Classics were defined as articles with ≥100 citations. Performance indicators were compared using Mann-Whitney U and Chi-square tests. Science mapping was performed with Biblioshiny and VOSviewer to identify intellectual, conceptual, and collaborative structures.\n\nResults: From 854 initial records, 100 most-cited articles were included, with Citation Classics (n = 62) showing significantly higher mean citation counts and rates per year than non-Classics (p < 0.0001). Reviews predominated among Classics, while original research was more frequent in non-Classics. High-impact journals such as Brain, Stroke, and NeuroImage accounted for the most influential articles, with strong correlations between journal metrics and citation performance. Leading institutions included Harvard Medical School, University of Cambridge, and University of California, Irvine. The United States, Germany, and the United Kingdom dominated global contributions, with emerging participation from China and Japan. Science mapping revealed clusters on motor recovery, cortical reorganization, language rehabilitation, and emerging areas like connectomics and machine learning.\n\nInterpretation: This study provides a comprehensive overview of MRI-based neuroplasticity research in stroke, identifying seminal works, leading contributors, and evolving research themes. While citation activity has declined, advances in connectomics, multi-modal imaging, and computational approaches offer promising directions. Expanding global collaborations and addressing underrepresented regions will be critical for inclusive progress. MRI remains central to bridging mechanistic insights with clinical applications, guiding innovation in personalized stroke rehabilitation.",
