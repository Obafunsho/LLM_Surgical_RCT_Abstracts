Eligible participants were surgeons performing high-risk surgeries and patients aged 60 or older with at least one comorbidity and an oncological or vascular problem. Patients were randomised to receive a question prompt list brochure with 11 questions or usual care. The primary outcome was the frequency of ACP discussions and documentation, assessed during audiorecorded preoperative consultations from June 1, 2016, to November 30, 2018. Randomisation was computer-generated, and allocation was concealed. Blinding was not applicable.\n\nResults: A total of 213 patients were randomised: 107 to the intervention and 106 to the control group. Analysis was conducted using an intention-to-treat approach. Only 13 consultations included ACP discussions. In this cohort, 141 patients (66%) did not have an advance directive (AD) on file before surgery. There was no significant association between the presence of an AD and patient age, number of comorbidities, or type of procedure. No significant differences were observed in ACP discussions or AD documentation between the intervention (38 [35%]) and control groups (34 [33%]; P = .77). Patients with complications expressed enthusiasm for ACP but did not prioritize discussing life-sustaining treatment preferences with their surgeon preoperatively. No adverse events were reported.\n\nInterpretation: Although surgeons recognize the importance of preoperative ACP, it is infrequently explored or documented. The intervention did not significantly enhance ACP discussions or AD documentation.\n\nTrial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02623335\n\nFunding: Not specified.",
