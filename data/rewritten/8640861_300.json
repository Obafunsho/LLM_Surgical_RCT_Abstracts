This trial investigates the effectiveness of conditioning techniques in reducing IR injury.\n\nMethods: Conducted in a tertiary care hospital, this randomised controlled trial included adult patients at risk of IR injury during surgical procedures. Participants were randomised using a computer-generated sequence, with allocation concealment ensured by sealed envelopes. Outcome assessors were blinded to group assignments.\n\nIntervention: Participants were allocated to receive either ischemic preconditioning (IPC) or remote ischemic preconditioning (RIPC) as the intervention, or standard care as the control.\n\nObjective: The study aimed to evaluate the impact of conditioning techniques on reducing IR injury.\n\nOutcome: The primary outcome was the reduction in biomarkers indicative of organ damage, assessed over a 72-hour period post-intervention.\n\nResults: A total of 200 participants were randomised, with 100 assigned to each group. The analysis included 98 participants in the intervention group and 97 in the control group, following an intention-to-treat approach. The intervention group demonstrated a significant reduction in biomarkers of organ damage (mean difference = 5.2, 95% CI 3.1 to 7.3; p = 0.01). Adverse events were minimal, with mild side effects reported in 3% of the intervention group and 1% of the control group.\n\nHarm: No severe adverse events were reported.\n\nTrial registration: N/A\n\nFunding: The trial was supported by institutional grants, ensuring no conflict of interest.\n\nThis study highlights the potential of conditioning techniques as a viable strategy to mitigate IR injury, warranting further research to optimize clinical applications.",
