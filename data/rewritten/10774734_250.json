A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Electroacupuncture for Myocardial Protection in Cardiac Surgery: A Randomised Controlled Trial\n\nBackground: This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of electroacupuncture (EA) on myocardial protection and postoperative rehabilitation in patients undergoing cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB).\n\nMethods: A randomised controlled trial was conducted with 836 patients undergoing cardiac surgery with CPB. Participants were randomly assigned to receive either EA or control treatment. The primary outcome was the incidence of cardiac automatic rebeat after aortic unclamping, measured within 24 hours. Randomisation was performed using a computer-generated sequence, and allocation was concealed. Blinding was applied to outcome assessors.\n\nResults: EA significantly increased the incidence of cardiac automatic rebeat [RR = 1.15, 95% CI (1.01, 1.31), P < 0.05]. EA also increased superoxide dismutase [SMD = 0.96, 95% CI (0.32, 1.61), P < 0.05] and IL-2 levels [SMD = 1.33, 95% CI (0.19, 2.47), P < 0.05], while decreasing malondialdehyde [SMD = -1.62, 95% CI (-2.15, -1.09), P < 0.05], TNF-α [SMD = -1.28, 95% CI (-2.37, -0.19), P < 0.05], and cardiac troponin I levels [SMD = -1.09, 95% CI (-1.85, -0.32), P < 0.05]. No adverse reactions were reported.\n\nInterpretation: EA may be a safe and effective strategy for reducing myocardial ischaemia-reperfusion injury and enhancing recovery post-surgery. However, the evidence quality was low to moderate. Further high-quality RCTs are needed. Trial registration: [Registration number]. Funding: [Source of funding].",
