This study examines the association between adjusted donor lung weight and PGD outcomes.\n\nMethods: This retrospective analysis included 194 bilateral lung transplantations conducted at Sahlgrenska University Hospital, Sweden, from January 2014 to May 2021. Donor lung weights were recorded post-procurement, adjusted for body surface area, and categorized into quartiles. The primary outcome was the incidence of PGD (grades II and III) within 72 hours post-transplant. Secondary outcomes included ICU stay duration, mechanical ventilation duration, pulmonary function at discharge, and one-year mortality. Due to the retrospective nature, randomisation and blinding were not applicable.\n\nResults: The \"high-weight\" group exhibited a significantly higher incidence of PGD (22.9%) compared to the \"low-weight\" group (8.9%) (p = 0.020). Multivariate regression identified adjusted lung weight as an independent risk factor for PGD. The \"low-weight\" group demonstrated shorter ICU stays (median 3 vs 5 days, p = 0.026) and higher rates of early extubation within 72 hours (90.9% vs 83.0%, p = 0.048). No significant differences were found in mechanical ventilation duration, spirometry values, or one-year survival. Adverse events were not specifically reported.\n\nInterpretation: Adjusted donor lung weight is an independent predictor of PGD, suggesting that higher lung weights are associated with worse early post-transplant outcomes. Incorporating lung weight into donor assessment protocols may improve recipient management and outcomes.\n\nFunding: The study was funded by Sahlgrenska University Hospital foundations, The Gothenburg Society of Medicine, and the Swedish Heart-Lung Foundation. Trial registration was not applicable due to the retrospective design.",
