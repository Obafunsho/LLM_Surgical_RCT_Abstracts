One knee was operated on using computer navigation, and the other without. Eligibility criteria included patients scheduled for bilateral TKA, conducted in a hospital setting. The primary outcome was the Knee Society knee score, assessed at a mean follow-up of 15 years. Randomisation was performed at the knee level, with allocation concealment. Both patients and assessors were blinded to treatment assignment. A total of 282 patients (95%) were analysed using an intention-to-treat approach.\n\nResults: No significant differences were observed between the computer-assisted and conventional TKA groups in Knee Society knee scores (92 ± 8 vs. 93 ± 7; p = 0.461), function scores, WOMAC scores, or radiographic alignment. The Kaplan-Meier survivorship was 99% in both groups at 15 years. Anterior femoral notching was noted in 11 knees (4%) in the computer-assisted group and none in the conventional group (p = 0.046). No differences in aseptic loosening rates were found (p = 0.918).\n\nInterpretation: Computer-assisted TKA did not show superior outcomes in terms of pain, function, or survivorship compared to conventional TKA. Given the associated risks and costs, its widespread use is not recommended without further evidence of long-term benefits.\n\nTrial registration: Not provided.\n\nFunding: Not provided.",
