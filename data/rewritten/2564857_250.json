A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Doxycycline as an Adjunct to Endovascular Aneurysm Repair\n\nBackground: Endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) durability is limited by aortic degeneration mediated by matrix metalloproteases (MMP). This study evaluates the effect of doxycycline, an MMP inhibitor, on EVAR outcomes.\n\nMethods: In this double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, patients undergoing EVAR were randomised to receive doxycycline (100 mg twice daily) or placebo for 6 months. The trial was conducted at [study setting]. Eligibility criteria included [participant eligibility criteria]. Randomisation was performed using [randomisation method] with allocation concealment via [allocation concealment method]. Blinding included patients, clinicians, and outcome assessors. The primary outcome was plasma MMP-9 levels at 6 months. Secondary outcomes included changes in aortic diameter and neck dilatation. Recruitment occurred from [start date] to [end date].\n\nResults: Forty-four patients were randomised: 20 to doxycycline and 24 to placebo. Intention-to-treat analysis showed a significant decrease in plasma MMP-9 in the doxycycline group at 6 months (−16.4±20.7%, P<0.05) compared to a non-significant increase in the placebo group (128.1±73.5%). In patients with endoleaks, plasma MMP-9 increased in 83% of placebo patients versus 14% of doxycycline patients (P<.03). Doxycycline led to greater decreases in aortic diameter (−13.3±3.3% vs. −3.8±3.0%, P<.05) and reduced aortic neck dilatation in Excluder endografts.\n\nInterpretation: Doxycycline inhibits MMP release and enhances aortic stability post-EVAR, suggesting potential as an adjunctive therapy. Further studies in larger populations are warranted. No adverse events were reported. Trial registration: [registration number]. Funding: [source of funding].",
