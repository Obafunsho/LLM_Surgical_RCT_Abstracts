This study investigates whether a 3-month course of oral antibiotics post-reimplantation reduces infection recurrence.\n\nMethods: In this multicenter, randomised controlled trial, adult patients undergoing two-stage hip or knee revision arthroplasty for PJI, meeting Musculoskeletal Infection Society (MSIS) criteria, were included. Participants were randomised to receive 3 months of oral antibiotics or no antibiotics after negative operative cultures at reimplantation. Randomisation was conducted using a computer-generated sequence with allocation concealment. Blinding was not applied. The primary outcome was infection-free survival, assessed over a mean follow-up of 14 months for the antibiotic group and 10 months for the control group. Analysis was performed on an intention-to-treat basis.\n\nResults: A total of 107 patients were randomised: 59 to the antibiotic group and 48 to the control group. Infection recurrence was lower in the antibiotic group (5% [three of 59] vs. 19% [nine of 48]; hazard ratio, 4.37; 95% CI, 1.297–19.748; p = 0.016). Three patients experienced adverse reactions to antibiotics, leading to discontinuation, and four did not adhere to the regimen. No significant difference was observed in the likelihood of new organism infection between groups (eight of nine in the control group vs. one of three in the treatment group, p = 0.087).\n\nInterpretation: Short-term follow-up suggests that 3 months of oral antibiotics post-reimplantation may improve infection-free survival. However, as this is an interim analysis, further follow-up is necessary to confirm these findings and assess the safety profile. Trial registration and funding details were not provided.",
