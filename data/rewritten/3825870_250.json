A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Femoral Head Size in Total Hip Arthroplasty\n\nBackground: Larger femoral heads are presumed to enhance joint stability and hip biomechanics, potentially hastening gait recovery. This study aimed to compare the effects of different femoral head sizes on gait parameters and hip function in total hip arthroplasty (THA).\n\nMethods: This randomised, blinded trial involved 60 female patients aged 55-70 years with primary hip arthritis, conducted at a single orthopedic center. Participants were randomised into three groups of 20 to receive a 28-mm, 36-mm ceramic-on-crosslinked polyethylene, or ≥42-mm metal-on-metal bearing couple. Randomisation was computer-generated, and allocation was concealed. Blinding included patients, clinicians, and outcome assessors. Gait analysis using an optoelectronic system was performed preoperatively and at 2 and 4 months postoperatively. The primary outcome was spatiotemporal gait parameters at 4 months.\n\nResults: All groups showed improvements in spatiotemporal, kinematic, and kinetic gait parameters, as well as Harris hip scores at 4 months, with no significant differences among groups. The mean difference in spatiotemporal parameters was not significant (p > 0.05). No adverse events were reported.\n\nInterpretation: Larger femoral heads did not result in superior early gait performance compared to smaller heads in THA. The study was registered under trial number [Trial Registration Number]. Funding was provided by [Funding Source].",
