A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Tranexamic Acid for Preventing Scar Tissue in Craniectomy\n\nBackground: This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of tranexamic acid in preventing scar tissue formation in the craniectomy area in rats.\n\nMethods: This randomised controlled trial involved 20 male Wistar rats, approximately 12 months old, undergoing bilateral frontoparietal craniectomy. The rats were randomly assigned to two groups: a control group (n=10) receiving saline-soaked cotton pads and a tranexamic acid group (n=10) receiving cotton pads soaked with 30 mg/kg tranexamic acid. The primary outcome was dura mater thickness, measured 30 days post-surgery. Pathological evaluation included scar tissue density and arachnoid involvement. Blinding was applied to the pathologist assessing outcomes.\n\nResults: The tranexamic acid group exhibited significantly thinner dura mater compared to the control group (p=0.001). Scar tissue density was significantly lower in the tranexamic acid group, with minimal scarring in 70% of rats, compared to severe scarring in 80% of the control group (p=0.006). Arachnoid involvement was also significantly reduced in the tranexamic acid group (p=0.02). No adverse events were reported in either group.\n\nInterpretation: The local application of tranexamic acid significantly reduces scar tissue formation and dura mater thickness in craniectomy sites in rats, suggesting potential benefits for reducing complications in subsequent surgeries. Further studies are needed to explore dose dependency and applicability in human settings.\n\nTrial registration: Not provided.\n\nFunding: Not specified.",
