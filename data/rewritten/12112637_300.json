A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Endovascular Versus Open Surgical Treatment for Isolated Popliteal Artery Lesions\n\nBackground: Isolated popliteal artery (PA) lesions account for approximately 1% of lower limb revascularisations, presenting challenges due to anatomical and biomechanical factors. This study compares the efficacy and safety of endovascular treatment (EVT) versus open surgical interventions for isolated PA lesions.\n\nMethods: This randomised controlled trial was conducted at a tertiary vascular surgery center. Eligible participants included patients with isolated PA lesions, excluding those with aneurysms or traumatic injuries. Participants were randomly assigned to receive either EVT or open surgery. The primary outcome was primary patency at 12 months. Randomisation was computer-generated, and allocation was concealed using sealed envelopes. Blinding was not feasible due to the nature of the interventions.\n\nResults: A total of 200 participants were randomised: 100 to the EVT group and 100 to the open surgery group, between January 2020 and June 2021. Analysis was conducted on an intention-to-treat basis, with 98 participants in the EVT group and 97 in the open surgery group analysed. The primary patency rate at 12 months was 71.7% in the EVT group and 75.6% in the open surgery group (p = 0.510). Adverse events occurred in 3% of the EVT group and 1% of the open surgery group, with mild severity.\n\nInterpretation: Both EVT and open surgery demonstrated comparable primary patency rates at 12 months, with a slightly higher incidence of adverse events in the EVT group. These findings suggest that EVT is a viable alternative to open surgery for isolated PA lesions. Further large-scale studies are needed to confirm these results and guide treatment decisions.\n\nTrial registration: N/A\n\nFunding: This study was supported by institutional research grants.",
