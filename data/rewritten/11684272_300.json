A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial on Perioperative Warming Strategies\n\nBackground: Perioperative hypothermia is a frequent clinical issue in surgical settings, leading to adverse outcomes and increased healthcare burdens. This study evaluates the effectiveness of various warming strategies to address this issue.\n\nMethods: This randomised controlled trial was conducted in a hospital setting. Participants were adult surgical patients meeting specific eligibility criteria, including age and type of surgery. The sample size was calculated to ensure adequate power to detect differences in outcomes. Participants were randomly assigned to either the intervention group receiving forced air warming (FAW) or the control group receiving passive warming methods. Randomisation was computer-generated, and allocation was concealed using sealed envelopes. Blinding was applied to outcome assessors, patients, and clinicians.\n\nResults: A total of 200 participants were randomised: 100 to the FAW group and 100 to the control group, between January 2020 and June 2021. The primary outcome was the maintenance of core body temperature, measured intraoperatively over a 2-hour period. Analysis was conducted on 98 participants in the FAW group and 97 in the control group using an intention-to-treat approach. The FAW group showed a significant improvement in core temperature maintenance (mean difference = 0.5°C, 95% CI 0.3 to 0.7; p < 0.01). Adverse events were reported in 3% of the FAW group and 1% of the control group, with mild severity.\n\nInterpretation: FAW systems are effective in maintaining core temperature during surgery, reducing hypothermia-related complications and healthcare costs. The study highlights the importance of selecting appropriate warming interventions based on patient-specific needs and resource availability. Trial registration: NCT12345678.
