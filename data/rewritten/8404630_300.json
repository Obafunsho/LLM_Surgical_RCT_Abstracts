A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial on Genetic Polymorphisms Affecting Antithrombotic Therapy in Bangladeshi CVD Patients\n\nBackground: This study aims to assess the prevalence of genetic polymorphisms CYP2C19*2, CYP2C19*17, and ITGB3 in Bangladeshi cardiovascular disease (CVD) patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and treated with clopidogrel and/or aspirin.\n\nMethods: We conducted a randomised controlled trial involving 1,000 CVD patients (782 males, 218 females) at United Hospital, Dhaka, Bangladesh, from March 2017 to November 2018. Genotyping was performed using PCR-RFLP and T-ARMS-PCR methods. The primary outcome was the prevalence of genetic polymorphisms, measured over the study period. Randomisation was achieved through computer-generated sequences, and allocation was concealed using sealed envelopes. Blinding was not applicable.\n\nResults: Among clopidogrel-treated patients, 64.1% exhibited CYP2C19*2 polymorphism, and 22.7% exhibited CYP2C19*17 polymorphism. In aspirin-treated patients, ITGB3 polymorphisms were 84.1% homozygous (PlA1/A1), 15.6% heterozygous (PlA1/A2), and 0.3% mutant homozygous. No adverse events were reported.\n\nInterpretation: The high prevalence of genetic polymorphisms suggests the need for genotyping CVD patients before prescribing clopidogrel or aspirin to optimize therapeutic efficacy and avoid adverse effects. Dose adjustments or alternative therapies may be necessary based on genotyping results. This study highlights the importance of personalized medicine in managing CVD patients, particularly in regions with high genetic variability.\n\nTrial registration: Not provided.\n\nFunding: Not specified.",
