A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial on Predictive Factors for Antibiotic Non-responsiveness in Uncomplicated Acute Appendicitis\n\nBackground: Antibiotics are effective for CT-diagnosed uncomplicated acute appendicitis. Identifying predictive factors for primary non-responsiveness or recurrence could enhance treatment success.\n\nMethods: This study combined data from two RCTs (APPAC and APPAC II) conducted in Finland, involving patients aged 18-60 years with CT-confirmed uncomplicated acute appendicitis. Participants were randomized to receive either antibiotics or appendectomy. The primary outcome was primary non-responsiveness to antibiotics within 30 days, assessed by comparing patients who underwent appendectomy for complicated appendicitis with those who had successful antibiotic treatment. Prognostic factors for appendicitis recurrence were also evaluated. Randomization was open-label, and outcome assessors were blinded.\n\nResults: Of 856 patients randomized to antibiotics, 832 were eligible for non-responsiveness analysis. An appendiceal diameter ≥15 mm (adjusted RR 4.00, 95% CI 2.00 to 7.92, P < 0.001) and body temperature >38°C (adjusted RR 2.76, 95% CI 1.27 to 6.03, P = 0.011) were associated with non-responsiveness. CRP ≥100 mg/l and leucocyte count ≥9 × 10^9/l during the first 6–30 h post-admission were also associated with non-responsiveness. No prognostic factors for recurrence were identified.\n\nInterpretation: Patients with an appendiceal diameter ≥15 mm and body temperature >38°C may not be optimal candidates for non-operative treatment. CRP <100 mg/l at 24 h of antibiotic treatment indicates a 99% likelihood of successful therapy.\n\nTrial registration: NCT03236961 and NCT01022567.\n\nFunding: Not specified.",
