A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of EC-IC Bypass in AICAO Patients\n\nBackground: Limited data exist on extracranial-intracranial (EC-IC) bypass outcomes in patients with recurrent hemispheric syndromes due to atherosclerotic internal carotid artery occlusion (AICAO).\n\nMethods: This randomised controlled trial enrolled participants from the Carotid Occlusion Surgery Study (COSS) with recurrent hemispheric ischemia (rHEMI+) and without (rHEMI−). Participants were randomised to surgical or medical treatment groups. The primary outcome was all stroke and death from randomisation through 30 days and ipsilateral ischemic stroke within 2 years. Randomisation was computer-generated, and allocation was concealed. Blinding was not applicable due to the nature of the intervention.\n\nResults: Of 195 participants, 100 were rHEMI+ (50 in each group). Baseline characteristics were similar except for previous stroke (61% vs 20%, P < .01) and TIA as the entry event (59% vs 21%, P < .01) in rHEMI+. No significant differences in the primary endpoint were observed between surgical and nonsurgical groups in rHEMI+ (26.3% vs 22.4%, P = .660) and rHEMI− (18.9% vs 19.5%, P = .943). Analysis was intention-to-treat. Adverse events were not reported.\n\nInterpretation: EC-IC bypass did not show benefit over medical treatment in patients with recurrent hemispheric stroke syndromes. Early aggressive risk factor management is recommended. Trial registration: [Trial registration number]. Funding: [Source of funding].",
