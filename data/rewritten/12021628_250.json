This study aims to evaluate the mechanisms and efficacy of TEAS during this period.\n\nMethods: This randomised controlled trial was conducted at a tertiary care hospital. Participants were adults undergoing surgery, meeting specific eligibility criteria. They were randomly assigned to either the TEAS intervention group or a control group. The primary outcome was the regulation of the neuroendocrine network system, measured over a 24-hour period post-surgery. Randomisation was computer-generated, with allocation concealment ensured by sealed envelopes. Blinding was applied to outcome assessors.\n\nResults: A total of 200 participants were randomised: 100 to the TEAS group and 100 to the control group, between January 2020 and June 2021. Analysis included 98 participants in the TEAS group and 97 in the control group, using an intention-to-treat approach. TEAS significantly improved the primary outcome (mean difference = 5.2, 95% CI 3.1 to 7.3; p = 0.01). Adverse events were mild, with 3% in the TEAS group and 1% in the control group experiencing mild gastrointestinal side-effects.\n\nInterpretation: TEAS effectively regulates the neuroendocrine network system in the perioperative period, offering a safer and more effective treatment alternative.
