A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Robotic-Assisted vs. Conventional THA\n\nBackground: Improper acetabular component orientation in total hip arthroplasty (THA) is associated with increased dislocation rates and component wear. This study evaluates whether robotic-assisted THA improves cup positioning within safe zones compared to conventional techniques.\n\nMethods: This matched-pair controlled study involved 100 patients undergoing THA from September 2008 to September 2012. Participants were matched by gender, age ±5 years, and BMI ±7 units. The intervention group (n=50) received robotic-assisted THA, while the control group (n=50) underwent conventional THA. The primary outcome was the proportion of cups positioned within the safe zones of Lewinnek et al. and Callanan et al., assessed radiographically. Randomisation and allocation concealment methods were not specified. Blinding details were not provided.\n\nResults: All robotic-assisted THAs (100%) were within Lewinnek's safe zone compared to 80% of conventional THAs (p=0.001). For Callanan's modified safe zone, 92% of robotic-assisted THAs were within range versus 62% of conventional THAs (p=0.001). Odds ratios for cups outside the safe zones were zero and 0.142, respectively (95% CI, 0.044, 0.457). No adverse events were reported.\n\nInterpretation: Robotic assistance significantly improved acetabular cup placement within safe zones, which is crucial for long-term THA success. However, whether these radiographic improvements translate into clinical benefits, such as reduced component impingement, wear, and dislocations, remains unproven. Trial registration and funding details were not provided. Further research is needed to assess the clinical implications of improved cup positioning.",
