A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Adjuvant Statin Therapy in Oesophageal Adenocarcinoma\n\nBackground: Statins may improve survival in oesophageal adenocarcinoma (OAC). This study assessed the feasibility of a phase III RCT of adjuvant statin therapy in operable OAC.\n\nMethods: This multicentre, double-blind, parallel-group, randomised, placebo-controlled feasibility trial involved adults with OAC (including Siewert I–II lesions) post-oesophagectomy. Participants were centrally randomised (1:1) to simvastatin 40 mg or placebo using block randomisation, stratified by centre. Blinding included participants, clinicians, and investigators. The primary outcome was drug absorption, measured by LDL cholesterol levels at 3 months. Recruitment occurred from October 2014 to July 2016.\n\nResults: Of 120 patients assessed, 32 (26.7%) were randomised, 16 per group. Seven withdrew. Simvastatin reduced LDL cholesterol by 3 months (adjusted mean difference −0.83 mmol/l, 95% CI −1.4 to −0.22; p = 0.009). Median adherence exceeded 90% between 3 and 12 months. Adverse events were similar between groups. Quality-of-life data completion was 98.3%. Cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and aspirin use were more prevalent in non-randomised patients. Survival estimates were imprecise.\n\nInterpretation: This RCT supports the feasibility of a phase III trial of adjuvant statin therapy in OAC. Trial registration: ISRCTN98060456.
