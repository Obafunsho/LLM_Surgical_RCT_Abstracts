Despite the increasing prevalence of peripheral artery disease and diabetes, existing patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) for CLTI are heterogeneous and lack specificity. This systematic review aims to evaluate current PROMs used in CLTI and identify gaps for developing a unified instrument.\n\nMethods: A systematic literature review was conducted on studies from 1990 to 2020 using PUBMED. The search was limited to English articles with abstracts, focusing on studies that included patients with CLTI and reported a PROM or health-related quality of life metric. A total of 337 studies were initially identified, with 99 meeting the inclusion criteria.\n\nResults: The review identified over 20 different PROMs used in CLTI studies, with the most common being the World Health Organization Quality of Life BREF, VascuQoL, Short Form measures, and EQ-5D. The use of PROMs in CLTI studies has increased over time, but no single PROM adequately captures all relevant domains for CLTI patients.\n\nInterpretation: The existing PROMs for CLTI are inadequate due to their lack of specificity and comprehensive coverage of relevant domains. A unified, validated PROM is needed to improve clinical care and research outcomes. This effort requires multidisciplinary collaboration and investment to develop a tool that accurately reflects the patient experience and treatment effects in CLTI.",
