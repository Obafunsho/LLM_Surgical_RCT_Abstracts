A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Device-Based Therapies for Hypertension Management\n\nBackground: Hypertension is a major modifiable risk factor for cardiovascular mortality, affecting over 1.3 billion people worldwide. Despite the availability of antihypertensive drugs, a significant portion of patients remains uncontrolled, highlighting the need for alternative treatment strategies.\n\nMethods: This randomised controlled trial assessed the efficacy of device-based therapies in managing hypertension. Participants were adults with resistant hypertension, recruited from multiple clinical centers. The intervention group received catheter-based renal denervation (RDN), while the control group received standard antihypertensive medication. Randomisation was computer-generated, with allocation concealment ensured by sealed envelopes. Outcome assessors were blinded to group assignments.\n\nObjective: To evaluate the effectiveness of RDN in reducing blood pressure compared to standard treatment.\n\nOutcome: The primary outcome was the change in systolic blood pressure (SBP) over a six-month period.\n\nResults: A total of 200 participants were randomised: 100 to the RDN group and 100 to the control group, between January 2020 and June 2021. Analysis was conducted on 98 participants in the RDN group and 97 in the control group using an intention-to-treat approach. The RDN group demonstrated a significant reduction in SBP (mean difference = 5.2 mm Hg, 95% CI 3.1 to 7.3; p = 0.01). Adverse events were mild, with 3% in the RDN group and 1% in the control group experiencing side effects.\n\nInterpretation: RDN significantly reduces SBP in patients with resistant hypertension, providing a promising alternative to standard treatment. The findings support the integration of RDN into clinical practice for managing resistant hypertension.\n\nTrial registration: NCT12345678\n\nFunding: This trial was funded by the National Institutes of Health.",
