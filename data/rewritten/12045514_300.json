A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Early Peritoneal Dialysis in Newborns Post-Cardiac Surgery: A Retrospective Cohort Study\n\nBackground: This study assesses a clinical strategy for early peritoneal dialysis (PD) initiation in newborns at high risk of cardiac surgery-associated acute kidney injury (CSA-AKI) following cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB).\n\nMethods: Conducted at the Children's Hospital of Mississippi, this retrospective single-center study involved 49 newborns who underwent congenital heart surgery between January 2012 and December 2015. PD catheters were placed in the operating room post-CPB. Newborns with prolonged CPB times (>180 minutes), postoperative oligoanuria, and/or inability to achieve negative fluid balance within 24 hours were selected for early PD (PD [+]). The primary outcomes were 5% fluid accumulation at 48 hours and severe AKI on postoperative day (POD) 5.\n\nResults: Of the 49 newborns, 29 were initiated on early PD, while 20 used the PD catheter as an abdominal drain. Both groups were oliguric during the first 8 hours postoperatively. The early PD group had significantly less urine output on POD 1 (0.98 vs. 3.02 ml/kg per hour; P = 0.001). At 48 hours, the prevalence of 5% fluid accumulation was similar between groups (16.7% vs. 7.41%; P = 0.427). Severe AKI incidence on POD 5 was also similar (17.3% vs. 5.0%; P = 0.204). Time to extubation was longer for the early PD group (10.0 vs. 4.0 days; P = 0.017). No deaths or major complications were reported during the study period.\n\nInterpretation: Persistent oliguria and inability to achieve negative fluid balance within 24 hours postoperatively may identify newborns who benefit from early PD. The first 8 hours postoperatively were not discriminative for this strategy. These findings suggest that early PD initiation may ameliorate the disadvantage for high-risk newborns post-cardiac surgery.",
