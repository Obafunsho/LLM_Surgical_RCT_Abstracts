A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Prophylactic Anticoagulation in Deceased-Donor Liver Transplantation\n\nBackground: Venous thrombosis is a significant complication following deceased-donor liver transplantation. This study aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of prophylactic anticoagulation with enoxaparin in this context.\n\nMethods: This dual-centre randomised controlled trial was conducted at West China Hospital, Sichuan University, and the First Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University. Eligible participants were adults aged 18-70 years undergoing deceased-donor liver transplantation. Patients were randomised 1:1 to receive either enoxaparin (40 mg daily) or normal saline for 7 days post-transplantation. The primary efficacy outcome was the incidence of venous thrombosis within 90 days. The primary safety outcome was major bleeding. Randomisation was stratified by surgeon and allocation was concealed using sealed envelopes. Blinding was applied to patients and ICU physicians, while surgeons were aware of group allocation.\n\nResults: A total of 462 patients were randomised between April 2020 and August 2023, with 231 in each group. In the intention-to-treat analysis, 89 patients (19.3%) experienced venous thrombosis, with no significant difference between groups. Major bleeding occurred in 141 patients (30.5%), with a higher incidence in the enoxaparin group (35.5% vs. 25.5%, p = 0.020). Subgroup analysis revealed a lower risk of deep vein thrombosis in hepatocellular carcinoma patients receiving enoxaparin (HR 0.44, 95% CI 0.23 to 0.86, p = 0.016), without a significantly higher risk of major bleeding.\n\nInterpretation: Prophylactic anticoagulation with enoxaparin is associated with a significantly higher incidence of major bleeding and does not reduce venous thrombosis in deceased-donor liver transplantation. These findings challenge the routine use of prophylactic anticoagulation in this setting. Trial registration: ChiCTR2000032441. Funding: Not specified.",
