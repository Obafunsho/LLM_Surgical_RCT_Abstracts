A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Opioid-Free Anesthesia in Bariatric Surgery\n\nBackground: Bariatric surgery is effective for weight reduction and comorbidity improvement. This study evaluates opioid-free anesthesia (OFA) with multimodal analgesia in morbidly obese patients to minimize respiratory and opioid-related complications.\n\nMethods: This single-center, randomized controlled trial was conducted at a tertiary care hospital. Participants were morbidly obese patients (BMI > 60 kg/m²) scheduled for laparoscopic gastric bypass. The intervention group received OFA with total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) using propofol, lidocaine, ketamine, and dexmedetomidine, while the control group received standard opioid-based anesthesia. Randomization was computer-generated, and allocation was concealed using sealed envelopes. Blinding was applied to outcome assessors.\n\nResults: A total of 100 participants were randomized: 50 to the OFA group and 50 to the control group. The primary outcome was postoperative pain control, measured by the visual analog scale (VAS) over 48 hours. The OFA group showed effective pain control (VAS < 3) and no postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV). No respiratory, cardiovascular, or gastric complications were observed. The OFA group had a shorter ICU stay and earlier discharge (mean difference = 2 days, 95% CI 1 to 3; p = 0.01). Adverse events were minimal, with 2% in the OFA group and 5% in the control group experiencing mild side effects.\n\nInterpretation: OFA with TIVA is feasible and safe in morbidly obese patients undergoing bariatric surgery, offering effective pain control and reduced complications. Further research is needed to validate these findings.\n\nTrial registration: NCT12345678\n\nFunding: Supported by the National Institute of Health.",
