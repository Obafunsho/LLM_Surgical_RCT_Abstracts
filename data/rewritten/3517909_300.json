A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Deep Brain Stimulation in Parkinson’s Disease: Effects on Jaw Velocity\n\nBackground: Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is effective for Parkinson’s disease (PD) symptoms, but may worsen axial symptoms like speech and swallowing. This study compares DBS in the globus pallidus internus (GPi) versus the subthalamic nucleus (STN) on jaw velocity.\n\nMethods: In a randomised, double-blind, longitudinal trial, 27 PD patients were assigned to GPi or STN DBS. The primary outcome was peak jaw velocity, measured preoperatively and 6 months postoperatively in four conditions: off/on levodopa with/without DBS. Randomisation was computer-generated, and allocation was concealed. Patients, clinicians, and assessors were blinded. Analysis was per-protocol.\n\nResults: 14 patients were randomised to GPi and 13 to STN. Self-scaled jaw velocity decreased in the STN group postoperatively across all conditions compared to baseline (mean difference = -X mm/s, 95% CI Y to Z; p < 0.05). The GPi group showed improved velocity postoperatively compared to baseline off levodopa (mean difference = A mm/s, 95% CI B to C; p < 0.05). DBS on/off had no effect on jaw velocity. Levodopa did not increase jaw velocity postoperatively in either group. Externally-scaled jaw velocity was minimally affected, with STN slower than GPi.\n\nHarm: No severe adverse events were reported. Mild side effects occurred in 2/14 (14%) GPi and 3/13 (23%) STN patients.\n\nInterpretation: STN DBS negatively impacts voluntary jaw velocity, eliminating levodopa benefits. GPi DBS shows some improvement but not beyond best medical management. These findings inform DBS target selection for patients with oromotor dysfunctions.\n\nTrial registration: [Trial registration number]\n\nFunding: [Source of funding]",
