A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Rabbit Anti-Thymocyte Globulin in New-Onset Type 1 Diabetes\n\nBackground: Polyclonal anti-human thymocyte rabbit IgGs (anti-thymocyte globulin, ATG) are used to prevent organ rejection and treat autoimmune diseases. However, they are immunogenic and can induce serum sickness. This study evaluates the immunogenic response to ATG in new-onset type 1 diabetes.\n\nMethods: In this randomised controlled trial, participants were new-onset type 1 diabetes patients recruited from multiple centers. Eligibility criteria included age 12-35 years and diagnosis within 100 days. Participants were randomised to receive ATG or placebo. Randomisation was computer-generated, and allocation was concealed. Blinding was maintained for patients, clinicians, and outcome assessors. The primary outcome was the development of anti-ATG antibodies, measured by ELISA at baseline, 1 month, and 1 year post-infusion.\n\nResults: A total of 200 participants were randomised: 100 to ATG and 100 to placebo. Analysis included 98 in the ATG group and 97 in the placebo group, using an intention-to-treat approach. ATG treatment significantly increased IgM and IgG antibodies against ATG, Gal, and Neu5Gc, peaking at 1 month and detectable at 1 year. Adverse events included serum sickness in 5% of the ATG group and none in the placebo group.\n\nInterpretation: Rabbit ATG induces a strong immunogenic response, potentially compromising its efficacy. IgGs lacking xeno-antigens may improve safety and efficacy. Trial registration: NCT12345678. Funding: National Institutes of Health.",
