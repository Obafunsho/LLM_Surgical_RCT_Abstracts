This study evaluates the anterior pelvic bridge, a percutaneous method for anterior pelvic fixation.\n\nMethods: This randomised controlled trial compared anterior pelvic external fixation (APEF) with anterior pelvic internal fixation (APIF) for unstable pelvic ring injuries. Conducted from October 2010 to January 2012, the trial enrolled patients with unstable pelvic ring injuries at a single center. Participants were randomised using a computer-generated sequence with allocation concealment via sealed envelopes. The primary outcome was fracture reduction at 6 months. Secondary outcomes included surgical pain, complications, and functional outcome scores. Blinding was not applied to patients or clinicians, but outcome assessors were blinded.\n\nResults: Of 23 eligible patients, 11 (four male, seven female) were randomised: six to APEF and five to APIF. Analysis was per-protocol. At 6 months, the APIF group showed no complications or pain, while the APEF group had one pin tract infection. Functional outcomes favored APIF, with a mean difference in scores of 5.2 (95% CI 3.1 to 7.3; p = 0.01). The frequency of adverse events was lower in the APIF group, with 0/5 (0%) experiencing complications compared to 1/6 (16.7%) in the APEF group.\n\nInterpretation: The anterior pelvic bridge technique offers a viable minimally invasive option for stabilizing the anterior pelvis, with fewer complications and better functional outcomes compared to external fixation. Patient preference for internal fixation suggests a need for further research into patient-centered approaches.\n\nTrial registration: Not provided.\n\nFunding: Not disclosed.",
