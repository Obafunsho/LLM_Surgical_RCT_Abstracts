Patients with osteoarthritis, idiopathic osteonecrosis, rheumatoid arthritis, or femoral neck fracture scheduled for unilateral primary THA were included. Participants were randomised using a computer-generated sequence and allocation was concealed in opaque envelopes. The AR-based system was compared to the accelerometer-based system, with the primary outcome being the absolute difference in cup placement angles measured on postoperative radiographs. The outcome assessors and patients were blinded. A sample size of 60 per group was calculated to detect a 2° difference in cup placement angle.\n\nResults: Between August and December 2021, 126 patients were randomised (62 to AR group, 64 to accelerometer group). The mean absolute difference in radiographic anteversion angle was smaller in the AR group (2° ± 2°) compared to the accelerometer group (5° ± 4°; 95% CI -4.2° to -2.0°; p < 0.001). Few complications were observed in either group.\n\nInterpretation: The AR-based system showed slight improvements in radiographic anteversion accuracy. However, the clinical significance of these differences remains uncertain. Until further studies demonstrate clear clinical benefits, the widespread use of AR-based systems is not recommended due to additional costs.\n\nTrial registration: [Trial registration number]\n\nFunding: [Source of funding]",
