A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Intraperitoneal Hyperthermic Chemoperfusion with Oxaliplatin for Peritoneal Surface Malignancy\n\nBackground: Cytoreductive surgery combined with intraperitoneal hyperthermic chemoperfusion (IPHC) has shown promise for treating peritoneal surface malignancy. This study aimed to determine the dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of oxaliplatin in IPHC for colorectal and appendiceal cancer dissemination.\n\nMethods: Conducted at [study setting], this phase I trial included adults with peritoneal dissemination from colorectal or appendiceal cancers. Participants were randomised into cohorts of three, undergoing cytoreductive surgery followed by a 2-hour IPHC with escalating oxaliplatin doses, starting at 200 mg/m² with 50 mg/m² increments. The primary outcome was DLT, defined as grade 3 toxicity lasting 5 days. Randomisation and allocation concealment methods were not applicable. Blinding was not implemented.\n\nResults: Fifteen patients were enrolled across two dose levels. Peritoneal fluid AUCs were higher than plasma levels, and intratumoral oxaliplatin concentrations were comparable to surrounding normal tissue. DLTs at 250 mg/m² were observed in two of three patients, establishing the MTD at 200 mg/m². Adverse events were significant at 250 mg/m², precluding higher doses. The analysis was per-protocol.\n\nInterpretation: IPHC with 200 mg/m² oxaliplatin is well tolerated and represents the MTD for a 2-hour chemoperfusion. The findings suggest that further studies at this dose are warranted to explore efficacy and safety. Trial registration: [Trial registration number]. Funding: [Source of funding].",
