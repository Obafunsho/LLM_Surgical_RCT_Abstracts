  "abstract": "1. 250-word version\n\nBackground: Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) is a significant postoperative complication associated with increased morbidity and mortality. This study aimed to investigate the association between preoperative platelet count and postoperative AKI in patients undergoing abdominal surgery.\n\nMethods: This retrospective cohort study utilized data from the INformative Surgical Patient dataset for Innovative Research Environment (INSPIRE) database, encompassing patients who underwent abdominal surgery at Seoul National University Hospital from 2011 to 2020. Logistic regression and restricted cubic spline analyses were employed to assess the relationship between preoperative platelet count and AKI risk.\n\nResults: A total of 7,131 patients were included. A significant inverse association was found between preoperative platelet count and postoperative AKI risk across all models (P for trend < 0.001 in unadjusted and partially adjusted models, 0.002 in fully adjusted model). The risk of developing AKI increased significantly when preoperative platelet counts were below 220 × 10⁹/L.\n\nInterpretation: Lower preoperative platelet counts are associated with an increased risk of postoperative AKI in patients undergoing abdominal surgery. Preoperative platelet count may serve as a useful biomarker for predicting AKI risk in this population.",
