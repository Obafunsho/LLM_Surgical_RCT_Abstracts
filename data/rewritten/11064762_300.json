A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Sealants for Hemostasis in Vascular Surgery\n\nBackground: Vascular anastomoses often bleed from needle holes, requiring hemostatic adjuncts like sealants. This study assesses the efficacy of sealants in achieving anastomotic hemostasis in vascular surgery.\n\nMethods: We conducted a randomised controlled trial with 2376 participants undergoing vascular surgery involving anastomosis. Participants were randomised to receive either sealants or standard care controls (oxidized cellulose, gelatin sponge, manual compression). The primary outcome was time to hemostasis, measured intraoperatively. Secondary outcomes included failure of hemostatic intervention, intraoperative blood loss, operating time, postoperative bleeding, and unplanned return to the operating room. Randomisation was computer-generated, with allocation concealment via sealed envelopes. Blinding was not feasible due to the nature of the intervention.\n\nResults: 2376 participants were randomised: 1188 to the sealant group and 1188 to the control group. Analysis was intention-to-treat. Sealant use reduced time to hemostasis (mean difference -230.09 seconds, 95% CI -329.24 to -130.94; p < 0.00001). Failure rates were lower in the sealant group (risk ratio 0.46, 95% CI 0.35 to 0.61; p < 0.00001). No significant differences were observed in intraoperative blood loss (mean difference -32.69 mL, 95% CI -96.21 to 30.83; p = 0.31), operating time (mean difference -18.72 minutes, 95% CI -40.18 to 2.73; p = 0.09), or postoperative bleeding (risk ratio 0.78, 95% CI 0.59 to 1.04; p = 0.09). Adverse events were not reported.\n\nInterpretation: Sealants may reduce time to hemostasis and failure rates in vascular surgery, but evidence is uncertain due to high risk of bias. Further trials are needed to confirm these findings and assess cost-effectiveness and adverse events.\n\nTrial registration: Not provided.\n\nFunding: Not reported.",
