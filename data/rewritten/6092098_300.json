A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Percutaneous Sciatic Nerve Peripheral Nerve Stimulation for Postoperative Analgesia in Ambulatory Foot Surgery\n\nBackground: This study aimed to assess the feasibility and analgesic efficacy of percutaneous sciatic nerve peripheral nerve stimulation (PNS) in ambulatory foot surgery.\n\nMethods: Conducted at the University of California San Diego, this randomised, double-masked, crossover trial included adults scheduled for primary, unilateral hallux valgus osteotomy. Exclusion criteria included certain medical conditions and treatments. Seven participants were randomised to receive either 5 minutes of PNS or sham stimulation, followed by a 5-minute crossover period. The primary outcome was pain reduction, measured using the numeric rating scale (NRS) over 40 minutes postoperatively. Randomisation was computer-generated, with allocation concealed in opaque envelopes. Blinding included patients, clinicians, and outcome assessors.\n\nResults: Four participants initially received PNS, showing a downward pain trend, while three receiving sham reported no change until crossover. Pain scores decreased to 52% of baseline during subsequent 30 minutes of stimulation. Three participants used a continuous popliteal nerve block for rescue analgesia. Adverse events included one lead dislodgement and three lead fractures. No sensory deficits or motor block were detected, except during continuous nerve block use. Resting and dynamic pain scores averaged less than 1 on the NRS, and opioid use averaged less than 1 tablet daily.\n\nInterpretation: Percutaneous sciatic nerve PNS is feasible and suggests analgesic benefits in ambulatory foot surgery, though lead dislodgement and fracture are concerns. The study provides initial efficacy data using a randomised, controlled design, indicating the need for further trials.\n\nTrial registration: Clinicaltrials.gov NCT02898103.\n\nFunding: Not specified.",
