A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial Comparing Continuous and Interrupted Suture Techniques for Biliary-Enteric Anastomosis\n\nBackground: This study aimed to compare continuous suture (CS) and interrupted suture (IS) techniques for biliary-enteric anastomosis (BEA) by evaluating suture time and biliary complications.\n\nMethods: In this single-centre randomised controlled trial, 82 patients scheduled for elective open BEA at University Hospital Dresden between January 2016 and September 2017 were randomised 1:1 to CS or IS groups. The primary outcome was suture time, measured intraoperatively. Secondary outcomes included postoperative complications, morbidity, and mortality up to 30 days, and survival. Randomisation was performed using block randomisation with allocation concealment via sealed envelopes. Patients and outcome assessors were blinded, but surgeons were not.\n\nResults: Eighty patients received the allocated intervention (41 CS, 39 IS). Suture time was significantly shorter in the CS group (median 12.0 minutes, IQR 10.0–17.0) compared to the IS group (median 22.4 minutes, IQR 15.0–28.0; OR 1.26, 95% CI 1.13 to 1.40; P < 0.001). Biliary complications, including bile leakage, were similar between groups (CS: 6/41, 14.6%; IS: 4/39, 10.3%; P = 0.738). No anastomotic stenosis occurred in either group.\n\nInterpretation: Continuous suture for BEA is faster and equally safe compared to interrupted suture. \n\nTrial registration: NCT02658643.\n\nFunding: Not specified.",
