  "abstract": "Title: A Randomised Controlled Trial of Nail Bed Repair with or without Fingernail Replacement in Children\n\nBackground: Nail bed injuries in children often require surgical repair, and the decision to replace the nail plate is controversial. This study aimed to assess the clinical and cost-effectiveness of nail bed repair with versus without fingernail replacement.\n\nMethods: This multicentre, two-arm, 1:1 parallel-group superiority RCT was conducted in 20 UK hospitals. Eligible participants were children under 16 years with a nail bed injury requiring surgical repair. The intervention involved replacing the fingernail, while the control involved discarding it. Co-primary outcomes were surgical-site infection at 7–10 days and cosmetic appearance at 4–12 months. Randomisation was computer-generated with allocation concealment, and outcome assessors were blinded.\n\nResults: A total of 451 children were randomised between July 2018 and December 2019, with 224 in the nail-discarded group and 227 in the nail-replaced group. Analysis included 218 and 222 participants, respectively, using an intention-to-treat approach. No significant difference was observed in infection rates (OR 2.49, 95% CI 0.58 to 10.61; p = 0.218) or cosmetic appearance (p = 0.118). The nail-discarded group had a mean cost saving of €84 (95% CI 34 to 140; p < 0.001). Two serious adverse events occurred, one in each group: paronychia and a reaction to anaesthesia.\n\nInterpretation: Discarding the fingernail after nail bed repair is as effective as replacement in terms of infection and cosmetic outcomes, with significant cost savings. This approach could lead to substantial healthcare savings. Trial registration: ISRCTN44551796. Funding: Supported by the UK National Institute for Health Research.",
