A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Systemic Opioid Analgesics in Neonates Post-Surgery\n\nBackground: Neonates undergoing surgery for congenital malformations or complications of prematurity require effective postoperative pain management. This study evaluates the benefits and harms of systemic opioid analgesics compared to placebo, non-pharmacological interventions, different opioids, or other drugs.\n\nMethods: We conducted a randomised controlled trial in preterm and term infants up to 46 weeks postmenstrual age with postoperative pain. Participants were randomised to receive opioids or comparators. Randomisation was computer-generated, with allocation concealment via sealed envelopes. Blinding included outcome assessors, patients, and clinicians. The primary outcome was pain, assessed using validated methods during initial hospitalisation.\n\nResults: Four RCTs with 331 infants were included. Two trials compared opioids with placebo, one compared fentanyl with tramadol, and one compared morphine with paracetamol. No meta-analyses were performed due to limited outcome data. The evidence was very uncertain for all outcomes, including pain and all-cause mortality. For tramadol vs. placebo, RR for mortality was 0.32 (95% CI 0.01 to 7.70). For fentanyl vs. tramadol, RR was 0.99 (95% CI 0.59 to 1.64). For morphine vs. paracetamol, MD in pain scores was 0.10 (95% CI -0.85 to 1.05). No adverse events were reported.\n\nInterpretation: Limited evidence exists on opioid use for neonatal postoperative pain. The study's findings are inconclusive due to imprecision and study limitations. Further research is needed to establish the efficacy and safety of opioids in this population.\n\nTrial registration: [Provide registration number]\n\nFunding: [Provide funding source]",
