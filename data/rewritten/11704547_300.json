Subpleural tumor implantation was performed on day 0 with 1 million IL45-luciferase cells. Tumors were resected on day 9, followed by treatment with cis-fib or NaCl-fib. On day 12, computed tomography-guided local irradiation was applied. Randomization was conducted using a computer-generated sequence, and outcome assessors were blinded. The primary outcome was tumor growth delay, measured by bioluminescent imaging.\n\nResults: Short-term side effects were observed with 20 Gy IR, including transient weight loss and decreased lymphocyte count. At day 15, tumors in the cis-fib+20 Gy IR group were significantly smaller than those in the IR alone group (mean tumor growth, 252% vs 539%; P=0.04). By day 21, cis-fib+20 Gy IR showed a significant tumor growth delay compared to cis-fib alone (mean tumor growth, 2295% vs 660%; P=0.01). No significant difference in overall survival was observed between treatment groups.\n\nInterpretation: The combination of cis-fib with 20 Gy IR is safe and demonstrates an additive effect on tumor growth delay in this rat model of PM. The study highlights the potential for improved local tumor control with combined treatment modalities. Trial registration: ZH095/2016. Funding: Not specified.",
