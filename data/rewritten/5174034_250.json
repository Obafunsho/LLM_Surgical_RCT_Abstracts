This study evaluates whether a 3-month course of oral antibiotics post-reimplantation reduces infection recurrence.\n\nMethods: This multicenter, randomised controlled trial included adult patients undergoing two-stage hip or knee revision arthroplasty for PJI, meeting Musculoskeletal Infection Society (MSIS) criteria. Participants were randomised to receive 3 months of oral antibiotics or no antibiotics after negative operative cultures at reimplantation. Randomisation was performed using a computer-generated sequence with allocation concealment. Blinding was not applied. The primary outcome was infection-free survival, assessed over a mean follow-up of 14 months for the antibiotic group and 10 months for the control group. Analysis was conducted on an intention-to-treat basis.\n\nResults: A total of 107 patients were randomised: 59 to the antibiotic group and 48 to the control group. Infection recurrence was lower in the antibiotic group (5% vs. 19%; hazard ratio, 4.37; 95% CI, 1.297–19.748; p = 0.016). Adverse reactions to antibiotics occurred in three patients, leading to discontinuation. No significant difference was observed in the likelihood of new organism infection between groups.\n\nInterpretation: Short-term follow-up suggests that 3 months of oral antibiotics post-reimplantation may improve infection-free survival. However, further follow-up is necessary to confirm these findings. Trial registration and funding details were not provided.",
