  "abstract": "1. A 250-word version\n\nBackground: This study investigates the efficacy of the F(SVC)–J(RA) configuration in veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (V–V ECMO) for improving systemic oxygenation in patients with severe respiratory failure. \n\nMethods: A single-case analysis was conducted in a 65-year-old male patient with severe respiratory failure. The intervention involved advancing the drainage cannula tip into the superior vena cava (SVC) and crossing the reinfusion cannula in the right atrium (RA). The primary outcome was the partial pressure of arterial oxygen (PaO2), measured over the course of ECMO treatment. \n\nResults: The patient demonstrated a PaO2 far above 200 mmHg despite near-absence of ventilation under lung rest settings. The recirculation ratio was calculated at 20.0%, and no right-to-left shunt was detected. \n\nInterpretation: The F(SVC)–J(RA) configuration may offer a significant advantage in achieving high systemic oxygenation during V–V ECMO without the need for specialized devices like dual lumen cannulae. Further studies are needed to confirm these findings and assess the safety and efficacy of this configuration in a larger cohort.",
