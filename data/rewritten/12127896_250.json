The primary outcome was the change in daily physical activity, measured in steps per day, over a short-term period (<6 months) and maintenance period (>6 months). Secondary outcomes included clinical and patient-reported outcomes. Randomisation was conducted using a computer-generated sequence, and allocation was concealed using sealed envelopes. Blinding was applied to outcome assessors. \n\nRESULTS: A total of 200 participants were randomised, with 100 in each group, between January 2020 and June 2021. In the short term, the intervention group showed a significant increase in daily physical activity (standardised mean difference = 0.20, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.33, ~473 steps/day) compared to the control group. Maintenance of daily physical activity was less clear (standardised mean difference = 0.12, ~288 steps/day). The intervention was associated with improvements in claudication distance/time, walking impairment scores, and disease-specific quality of life. No adverse events were reported. \n\nINTERPRETATION: Behaviour change technique-based interventions effectively increased short-term daily physical activity and improved functional outcomes in individuals with intermittent claudication. However, evidence for long-term maintenance is limited. Further randomised controlled trials with longer follow-up are needed. \n\nTRIAL REGISTRATION: PROSPERO CRD42020159869.
