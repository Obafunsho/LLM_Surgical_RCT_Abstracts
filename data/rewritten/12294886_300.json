A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Continuous Pressure Monitoring in Regional Anesthesia\n\nBackground: Accurate localization of interfascial planes is essential for effective regional anesthesia, yet ultrasound guidance can be challenging in certain populations. This study evaluates whether continuous monitoring of injection pressure can differentiate interfascial spaces from surrounding structures in a porcine model.\n\nMethods: This randomised controlled trial was conducted on porcine thighs, with randomisation at the interfascial space level. A custom-built pressure monitoring system continuously measured saline injection pressure during ultrasound-guided regional block procedures. Needle positions were classified as intramuscular, resting on fascia, or interfascial. Statistical analyses included Wilcoxon signed-rank tests and regression analysis. The primary outcome was the differentiation of interfascial spaces, measured during the procedure.\n\nResults: Mean intramuscular pressure was significantly higher than mean interfascial pressure (p < 1 × 10^−13). Interfascial injections showed lower pressure variability (p = 2.1 × 10^−4) and an increasing pressure trend over time (p = 2.1 × 10^−4), while intramuscular injections exhibited a decreasing trend (p = 3.15 × 10^−3). No adverse events were reported. The study was conducted with blinding of the operator to the pressure measurements.\n\nInterpretation: Continuous pressure monitoring effectively distinguishes interfascial from intramuscular and fascial penetration phases, enhancing needle guidance and improving the safety and accuracy of interfascial plane blocks. The method demonstrates potential as a real-time, objective tool for regional anesthesia. Further cadaveric and clinical studies are warranted to validate these findings.\n\nFunding: The study was funded by grant RW/36/25. No trial registration number is available as this was a pilot study.",
