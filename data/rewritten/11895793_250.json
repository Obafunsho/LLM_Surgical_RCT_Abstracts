A 250-word version\n\nTitle: A Randomised Controlled Trial Comparing Pressure-Controlled and Volume-Controlled Ventilation in Rhinoplasty\n\nBackground: Intraoperative bleeding is a significant challenge in rhinoplasty, affecting surgical outcomes and patient safety.\n\nMethods: This double-blind, randomised controlled trial was conducted at Hazrat-e Fatemeh Hospital, Iran University of Medical Sciences, from 2021 to 2022. Sixty patients aged 18-50 years, classified as ASA I or II, were randomised to receive either pressure-controlled ventilation (PCV) or volume-controlled ventilation (VCV) during rhinoplasty. Randomisation was achieved using a table of random numbers, with allocation concealed in sealed envelopes. Both patients and surgeons were blinded to group assignments. The primary outcome, intraoperative bleeding, was measured by weighing blood-soaked gauze and suctioned fluid. The timeframe for measurement was the duration of the surgery.\n\nResults: Fifty-eight patients completed the study, with 31 in the PCV group and 27 in the VCV group. The mean intraoperative bleeding volume was 30 ± 45 mL in the PCV group and 100 ± 120 mL in the VCV group (P < 0.001). Logistic regression analysis showed that the odds of experiencing moderately severe or severe bleeding were 5.4 times higher in the VCV group, increasing to 26.8 (95% CI = 1.2, 59.3) after adjusting for confounders. No adverse events were reported in either group.\n\nInterpretation: PCV mode significantly reduces intraoperative bleeding compared to VCV mode, likely due to decreased peak airway pressure. These findings support the use of PCV in rhinoplasty to improve surgical outcomes. Trial registration: IRCT20101026005026N13. Funding: Not specified.",
