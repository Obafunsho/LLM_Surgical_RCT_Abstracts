Participants were randomised to LR (357) or sublobar resection (SLR) (340), stratified by clinical tumor size, histology, and smoking history. Randomisation was conducted using a computer-generated sequence with allocation concealment. The primary outcome was DFS over five years. Blinding was not applied.\n\nResults: A total of 362 patients underwent LR, 131 SR, and 204 WR. Five-year DFS was 64.7% for LR, 63.8% for SR, and 62.5% for WR (p = 0.888). Five-year OS was 78.7% for LR, 81.9% for SR, and 79.7% for WR (p = 0.873). Five-year LCSS was 86.8% for LR, 89.2% for SR, and 89.7% for WR (p = 0.903). Locoregional recurrence occurred in 12% of SR and 14% of WR (p = 0.295). Median reduction in % FEV1 at 6 months was 5% for WR and 3% for SR (p = 0.930).\n\nInterpretation: LR, SR, and WR showed similar survival outcomes. No significant differences were observed in locoregional recurrence or FEV1 reduction between SR and WR.\n\nTrial registration: [Trial registration number]\n\nFunding: [Source of funding]",
