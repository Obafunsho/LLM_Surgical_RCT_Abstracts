Ablation was further randomised between pulmonary vein isolation and biatrial maze. The primary outcome was freedom from AF, atrial flutter (AFL), or atrial tachycardia (AT) over 12 months, assessed via transtelephonic monitoring (TTM). Randomisation was conducted using a computer-generated sequence, and allocation was concealed. Blinding was not specified. The study was conducted at [study setting], and eligibility criteria included [participant eligibility criteria].\n\nResults: A total of 228 patients (88%) submitted 7949 TTM recordings. Freedom from AF/AFL/AT was higher in the ablation group compared to MVS alone (63% vs 29%; P < .001). The biatrial maze showed a trend towards higher freedom from AF/AFL/AT compared to pulmonary vein isolation (odds ratio, 2.31; 95% CI, 0.95–5.65; P = .07). The AF/AFL/AT load was similar between lesion sets (odds ratio, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.57–1.43; P = .6). Within 12 months, the estimated prevalence of AF/AFL/AT by TTM was 58% after MVS alone, and 36% versus 23% after pulmonary vein isolation versus biatrial maze (P < .02). No adverse events were reported.\n\nInterpretation: The biatrial maze is associated with lower AF/AFL/AT prevalence compared to pulmonary vein isolation, but not a lower load. The discrepancy between Holter monitoring and TTM suggests the need for a confirmatory trial. Trial registration: [Trial registration number]. Funding: [Source of funding].",
