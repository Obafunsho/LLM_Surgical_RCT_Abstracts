A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Landiolol for Tachyarrhythmias Management\n\nBackground: Landiolol, an ultra-short-acting, selective β1-adrenergic receptor blocker, is used for managing tachyarrhythmias, particularly atrial fibrillation, in perioperative settings.\n\nMethods: This randomised controlled trial was conducted in Japan, with participants recruited from cardiac and non-cardiac surgery settings. Eligibility criteria included patients with intraoperative tachyarrhythmias. Participants were randomised using a computer-generated sequence with allocation concealment via sealed envelopes. Blinding was applied to outcome assessors, patients, and clinicians.\n\nIntervention: Participants received either landiolol or a comparator β-blocker, esmolol, for heart rate control.\n\nObjective: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of landiolol compared to esmolol in controlling heart rate.\n\nOutcome: The primary outcome was heart rate control within 24 hours post-intervention.\n\nResults: A total of 200 participants were randomised: 100 to the landiolol group and 100 to the esmolol group. Analysis was conducted on 98 participants in the landiolol group and 97 in the esmolol group using an intention-to-treat approach. Landiolol demonstrated superior heart rate control (mean difference = 5.2 bpm, 95% CI 3.1 to 7.3; p = 0.01). Adverse events were mild, with 3% in the landiolol group and 1% in the esmolol group experiencing mild gastrointestinal side-effects.\n\nTrial registration: The trial was registered under number XYZ123.\n\nFunding: The study was funded by ABC Pharmaceuticals.",
