A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Preoperative Exercise in Pancreatic Cancer Patients\n\nBackground: This randomised controlled trial aimed to evaluate the effects of a preoperative, home-based exercise program on fitness and physical function in patients with pancreatic cancer, addressing the high prevalence of sarcopenia and frailty in this population.\n\nMethods: Patients with pancreatic cancer were randomised to either Arm A (enhanced usual care) or Arm B (prescribed aerobic and resistance exercise during neoadjuvant therapy). Both groups received nutrition counseling and activity trackers. The primary outcome was the 6-minute walk distance (6MWD), with a clinically meaningful improvement defined as ≥14 meters. Secondary outcomes included additional physical function tests, health-related quality of life, and clinical outcomes. Randomisation was conducted using a computer-generated sequence, and allocation was concealed. Blinding was not specified.\n\nResults: A total of 151 patients were randomised, with 76 in Arm A and 75 in Arm B, recruited between specified dates. Weekly strength training sessions increased significantly more in Arm B (1.8±1.8 vs. 0.1±2.4 sessions, P <0.001). The 6MWD improved in both Arm A (mean change 18.6±56.8 m, P =0.01) and Arm B (27.3±68.1 m, P =0.002). No significant differences were observed in quality of life and clinical outcomes between arms. Analysis was conducted on an intention-to-treat basis. No adverse events were reported.\n\nInterpretation: Both exercise and enhanced usual care improved physical performance, highlighting the importance of activity in surgical preparation. The findings suggest that a structured exercise program can be beneficial for patients undergoing neoadjuvant therapy for pancreatic cancer. Trial registration: NCT03187951. Funding: Not specified.",
