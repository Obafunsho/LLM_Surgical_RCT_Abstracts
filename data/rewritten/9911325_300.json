Animals were randomly assigned to receive the MIRTH intervention or serve as controls. The primary outcome was the change in left ventricular performance, assessed by contractility and mechanical efficiency, over a 90-day period. Randomisation was performed using a computer-generated sequence, and allocation was concealed with sealed envelopes. Due to the nature of the intervention, blinding was not applicable.\n\nResults: A total of 33 animals were randomised: 17 with healthy myocardium and 16 with ischemic cardiomyopathy. MIRTH significantly improved left ventricular performance in cardiomyopathic animals, with increased contractility and mechanical efficiency (p < 0.05). In healthy animals, MIRTH resulted in a 6% increase in ejection fraction (p = 0.045). No adverse events related to myocardial erosion were observed, although two early implants failed due to suture abrasion, leading to a change to ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene suture. Nine of 12 healthy animals survived to 90 days, with two deaths attributed to unrelated bacterial sepsis.\n\nInterpretation: MIRTH demonstrates significant improvements in cardiac performance in cardiomyopathic swine, offering a promising approach to ventricular remodeling. The procedure's safety and efficacy warrant further investigation in clinical settings.\n\nTrial registration: Not provided.\n\nFunding: Supported by the Division of Intramural Research, National Heart Lung and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health USA (grant Z01-HL006040).",
