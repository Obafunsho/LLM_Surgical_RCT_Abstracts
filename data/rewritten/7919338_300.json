A 300-word version\n\nBACKGROUND: Glioblastoma (GBM) therapy resistance is often due to cancer stem-like cells maintained by the Notch signaling pathway, dependent on gamma secretase activity. RO4929097, an oral gamma secretase inhibitor, was assessed for its potential to inhibit tumor growth in GBM patients.\n\nMETHODS: Conducted at [study setting], this phase II and pharmacodynamic study involved patients with recurrent GBM, randomized into two groups. Group A, with unresectable disease, received RO4929097 in a standard phase II design. Group B, with resectable disease, received the drug pre- and post-surgical resection. The primary outcome was the 6-month progression-free survival rate (PFS 6), with secondary outcomes including neurosphere formation inhibition in resected samples. Randomization was executed using [randomization method], with allocation concealment by [method]. No blinding was applied to outcome assessors, patients, or clinicians.\n\nRESULTS: A total of 47 patients were randomized, with 40 in Group A and 7 in Group B. The PFS 6 was 4% (95% CI [confidence interval]), and neurosphere formation was inhibited in 1 of 7 patient samples. Adverse events occurred in [number] patients, with [frequency and severity] reported. The analysis was conducted using an intention-to-treat approach.\n\nINTERPRETATION: RO4929097 demonstrated minimal efficacy in recurrent GBM patients, with limited neurosphere formation inhibition. The trial was registered under [trial registration number] and funded by [source of funding]. Further research is needed to explore alternative therapeutic strategies for GBM.",
