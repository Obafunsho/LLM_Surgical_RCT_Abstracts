A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial on Pharyngeal and Laryngeal Alterations in ABI Patients with Nasogastric and Tracheostomy Tubes\n\nBackground: This study aims to explore the effects of prolonged nasogastric tube (NGT) and tracheostomy on pharyngeal and laryngeal structures in patients with acquired brain injury (ABI).\n\nMethods: A retrospective study was conducted on 103 ABI patients with NGT indwelled for more than 1 month, admitted to Huashan Hospital, Fudan University, from October 2019 to October 2023. Participants were divided into two groups based on tracheostomy status. Fiberoptic endoscopic examination of swallowing (FEES) was used to assess structural and functional changes. The primary outcome was the presence of structural abnormalities, measured at the time of FEES. Randomisation and allocation concealment methods were not applicable due to the retrospective nature of the study. Blinding was not implemented.\n\nResults: The NGT–TRACH group exhibited higher rates of epiglottis shape abnormality, glossoptosis, and pharyngeal stenosis compared to the NGT group (p < 0.05). No significant differences were found in other parameters. The study did not report adverse events.\n\nInterpretation: Prolonged NGT and tracheostomy are associated with significant structural changes in the pharynx and larynx, potentially impeding swallowing recovery. These findings suggest the need for tailored management strategies in ABI patients with long-term tube placement. The study highlights the importance of early intervention and regular assessment using FEES to mitigate adverse effects. Further research is needed to establish causal relationships and develop effective treatment protocols.\n\nTrial registration: Not applicable.\n\nFunding: The study did not specify funding sources.",
