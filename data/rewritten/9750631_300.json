A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Pexidartinib for Pain Relief in Tenosynovial Giant Cell Tumor\n\nBackground: This phase 3 randomised controlled trial (ENLIVEN) assessed the efficacy of pexidartinib in reducing pain in adults with tenosynovial giant cell tumor (TGCT) not amenable to surgery.\n\nMethods: ENLIVEN was a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial conducted at 39 centers in Australia, North America, and Europe. Participants were adults with symptomatic TGCT, randomized 1:1 to receive pexidartinib (n=61) or placebo (n=59) for 24 weeks. Randomization was via an integrated web response system, with allocation concealment. The primary outcome was a ≥30% decrease in weekly mean worst-pain NRS score with <30% increase in narcotic use from baseline to week 25. Blinding included patients, clinicians, and assessors. The study was powered to detect a 25% difference in tumor response, not pain relief.\n\nResults: Pain response was observed in 31% (19/61) of the pexidartinib group versus 15% (9/59) of the placebo group (p=0.03). Exploratory analyses showed a 50% pain reduction in 26% (16/61) of pexidartinib patients versus 10% (6/59) placebo (p=0.02). Mean pain score change was -2.5 for pexidartinib versus -0.3 for placebo (p<0.001). Pain relief correlated with tumor size reduction (r=0.44) and volume score (r=0.61). Adverse events included liver toxicity.\n\nInterpretation: Pexidartinib provided modest pain relief in TGCT patients, but findings do not support routine use for pain management. Further studies are needed to confirm these results and explore patient-centered outcomes.\n\nTrial registration: NCT02371369. Funding: Not specified.",
