A 300-word version\n\nTitle: A Randomised Controlled Trial of Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass vs. Intensive Medical Management for Type 2 Diabetes\n\nBackground: Bariatric surgery is increasingly recognized as a therapeutic option for type 2 diabetes mellitus. This study evaluates the feasibility of a larger trial to compare the long-term effects of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) with an intensive diabetes medical and weight management program (Why WAIT).\n\nMethods: Conducted at an academic medical institution, this 1-year pragmatic randomised clinical trial included participants aged 21-65 years with type 2 diabetes diagnosed over a year prior, a BMI of 30-42, and HbA1c ≥6.5%. Participants were randomised to RYGB (n=19) or Why WAIT (n=19) using a computer-generated sequence with allocation concealment. The primary outcome was the proportion of patients achieving fasting plasma glucose <126 mg/dL and HbA1c <6.5% at 1 year. Blinding was not applied.\n\nResults: At 1 year, 58% of RYGB patients achieved the primary outcome compared to 16% in the Why WAIT group (P=0.03). RYGB led to greater reductions in HbA1c, weight, waist circumference, fat mass, lean mass, blood pressure, and triglycerides, and an increase in HDL cholesterol. Cardiovascular risk scores improved more in the RYGB group. Quality of life improvements were similar between groups, except for greater weight-related quality of life improvement in RYGB. No significant adverse events were reported in either group.\n\nInterpretation: RYGB results in greater weight loss and cardiometabolic improvements compared to medical management in obese patients with type 2 diabetes. Both treatments enhance general quality of life, but RYGB offers superior weight-related quality of life benefits. These findings may guide therapeutic decisions until larger trials are conducted.\n\nTrial registration: [Trial registration number]\n\nFunding: [Source of funding]",
