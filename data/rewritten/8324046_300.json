A 300-word version\n\nTitle: A Randomised Controlled Trial Comparing Supraclavicular and Retroclavicular Brachial Plexus Block on Diaphragmatic Function\n\nBackground: The ultrasound-guided retroclavicular block (RCB) offers a potential advantage over the supraclavicular block (SCB) by reducing the incidence of phrenic nerve block, which has not been formally evaluated.\n\nMethods: This double-blinded, randomised controlled trial was conducted at a single tertiary hospital from December 2017 to May 2019. Forty patients scheduled for upper extremity surgery below the axilla were randomised to receive either SCB or RCB with ropivacaine 0.5%. Exclusion criteria included significant pulmonary disease, BMI >40, and contraindications to peripheral nerve block. Randomisation was computer-generated, and allocation concealment was achieved using sealed envelopes. Blinding was maintained for patients and outcome assessors. The primary outcome was the incidence of phrenic block, measured by changes in diaphragmatic excursion and maximum inspiratory volume at baseline, 15, 30 minutes postblock, and postoperatively.\n\nResults: A total of 40 patients were randomised, with 20 in each group. The SCB group exhibited a higher incidence of phrenic block (70% by ultrasound, 55% by spirometry) compared to the RCB group (15% by ultrasound, 5% by spirometry). Diaphragmatic excursion and inspiratory volume decreased more significantly in the SCB group (p < 0.001). No differences were found in the timing and extent of distal arm block, although suprascapular and axillary nerves were more consistently blocked in the SCB group. No adverse events were reported.\n\nInterpretation: The RCB is significantly less likely to affect ipsilateral diaphragmatic function than the SCB, supporting its use in clinical practice.
