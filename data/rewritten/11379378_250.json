Participants were assessed over 90 days using the Objective Structured Assessment of Technical Skills (OSATS) Modified. The primary outcome was the acquisition of operative skills and reduction in anastomosis time for side-to-side (S-T-S), end-to-side (E-T-S), and end-to-end (E-T-E) coronary anastomoses. All sessions were recorded and evaluated by a single senior cardiothoracic surgeon. Randomisation and blinding were not applicable.\n\nResults: A total of 140 residents were assessed in 270 sessions. Junior residents showed significant improvement in S-T-S anastomosis skills (p < 0.05). Senior residents demonstrated significant improvement in S-T-S anastomosis skills (p < 0.05). Senior residents also showed a significant reduction in anastomosis time compared to juniors in S-T-S (8.11 vs. 11.22 minutes), E-T-S (7.93 vs. 10.10 minutes), and E-T-E (6.56 vs. 9.68 minutes) (p = 0.039).\n\nInterpretation: The simulator effectively improved operative skills and reduced anastomosis time, suggesting a positive impact on surgical training. No adverse events were reported. The study was not registered, and funding details were not provided.",
