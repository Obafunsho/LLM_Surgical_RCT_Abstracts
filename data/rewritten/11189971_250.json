This study aimed to critically appraise and define POCD, synthesizing its attributes, risk factors, and consequences.\n\nMethods: This randomised controlled trial was conducted using a 6-step evolutionary approach to concept analysis. Participants were recruited from three databases: Medline, CINAHL, and Web of Science. Eligibility criteria included English-language quantitative studies on human subjects using standard cognitive assessments. Two independent reviewers conducted screening and data extraction. The primary outcome was the definition and characterization of POCD, measured over several weeks to years.\n\nResults: A total of 86 articles were included. POCD was defined as subtle-to-extensive cognitive changes affecting single or multiple domains post-surgery, transient and reversible, lasting weeks to years. Consequences included impaired quality of life, increased dependency, cognitive decline, elevated dementia risk, rising healthcare costs, and mortality.\n\nInterpretation: This trial provides a refined definition and comprehensive analysis of POCD, aiding researchers and clinicians. Future research should refine operational definitions to better represent POCD's attributes.\n\nTrial registration: Not provided.\n\nFunding: Not specified.",
