A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Predictors of 30-Day Stroke or Death in Symptomatic Intracranial Atherosclerosis: A Randomised Controlled Trial\n\nBackground: This study aims to identify predictors of 30-day stroke or death in patients with symptomatic intracranial atherosclerosis (sICAS) undergoing stenting, using data from the SAMMPRIS trial.\n\nMethods: This post-hoc analysis of the SAMMPRIS trial included patients who underwent angioplasty/stenting. We compared patient-specific, lesion-specific, and procedure-specific variables, as well as FDA-approved indications, between patients with and without the primary outcome. Logistic regression analyses were performed to evaluate associations with the primary outcome.\n\nResults: A total of 213 patients were included, with 30 patients (14.1%) experiencing the primary outcome of stroke or death at 30 days. Smoking status and lesion length were associated with the primary outcome; non-smokers had higher odds of stroke or death compared to smokers (adjusted OR 4.46, 95% CI 1.79–11.1, p = 0.001), and increasing lesion length was also associated (adjusted OR 1.20, 95% CI 1.02–1.39, p = 0.029). The predictive value was modest: absence of smoking history (sensitivity = 66.7%, specificity = 65.4%) and lesion length (AUC = 0.606). Event rates did not differ significantly between patients with and without FDA-approved indications for stenting (15.9% vs. 12%, p = 0.437).\n\nInterpretation: Clinical and neuroimaging variables, as well as FDA indications for stenting, did not reliably predict the primary outcome. Further research is needed to identify reliable biomarkers for stroke/death in sICAS patients before new clinical trials of stenting are considered.",
