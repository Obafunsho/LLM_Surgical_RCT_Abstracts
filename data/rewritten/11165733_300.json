Participants were randomly assigned to two groups: Group 1 received in-person feedback first, followed by remote feedback, while Group 2 received remote feedback first, followed by in-person feedback. The primary outcome was the effectiveness of remote feedback, assessed through interviews and a validated questionnaire post-training. Randomisation was achieved through a crossover design, and allocation concealment was not specified. Blinding was not implemented for participants or outcome assessors.\n\nResults: The questionnaire results showed no significant difference between remote and in-person feedback. Interviews revealed mixed feelings about remote feedback, but participants reported no limiting factors to practice. Clear communication and shared task understanding were critical for successful remote feedback. No adverse events were reported during the study.\n\nInterpretation: Remote expert feedback is a feasible and effective method for endovascular skills training, providing increased practice opportunities for vascular surgery residents. The study underscores the importance of effective communication in remote learning environments and suggests that remote feedback can complement traditional in-person training.\n\nTrial registration: Not provided.\n\nFunding: Not specified.",
