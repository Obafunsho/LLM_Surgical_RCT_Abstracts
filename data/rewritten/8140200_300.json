This study aimed to assess the impact of surgical cognitive simulation (SCS) training on surgical skills.\n\nMethods: In this randomised controlled trial, general surgical trainees in years 3–5 from the West Midlands Deanery were recruited. Participants were randomly assigned to an intervention group receiving SCS training or a control group without training. The primary outcome was the change in procedure-based assessment scores, evaluated over four months. Randomisation was performed using a random number generator, and assessors were blinded to group allocation. The study setting was the University of Leeds, and the sample size calculation indicated nine participants per group for statistical significance.\n\nResults: Between January and June 2021, 21 participants were recruited, with 10 assigned to the intervention group and 11 to the control group. Complete data were available for 7 participants in each group. The intervention group demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in 11 of 16 assessment domains (P < 0.050) and a mean reduction in procedure time (–15.98 vs. –1.14 min; P = 0.024). Subjective evaluations indicated enhanced preoperative preparedness and intraoperative focus. No adverse events were reported.\n\nInterpretation: SCS training significantly improved surgical performance, with subjective feedback supporting its practical application. SCS may be a valuable adjunct to traditional surgical training methods, enhancing skill acquisition and performance.\n\nTrial registration: Not provided.\n\nFunding: The study was funded by Health Education England (West Midlands) and supported by a Fellowship from the Alan Turing Institute and an MRC Confidence in Concept Award.",
