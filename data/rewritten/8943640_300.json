A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Shared Decision-Making in Major Surgery for Older Adults\n\nBackground: Major surgery carries significant risks for older adults with comorbidities, highlighting the importance of shared decision-making to ensure care aligns with patient goals. This study examines the prevalence and effectiveness of shared decision-making in surgical consultations.\n\nMethods: This secondary analysis of a randomised clinical trial included 43 surgeons and 446 patients aged 60 or older with at least one comorbidity, conducted at outpatient surgical clinics across five academic centers. Participants were randomised to receive a question prompt list brochure or standard care. The primary outcome was the OPTION5 score, measuring shared decision-making (range 0-100), assessed over consultations from June 1, 2016, to November 31, 2018. Randomisation was computer-generated, with allocation concealment ensured. Blinding was not applicable.\n\nResults: Of 378 consultations analysed, the mean OPTION5 score was 34.7 (SD 20.6), with no significant difference between the intervention (mean 36.7, SD 21.2) and control (mean 32.9, SD 19.9) groups (effect estimate 3.80; 95% CI, −0.30 to 8.00; P = .07). Individual surgeon performance varied, with scores ranging from a median of 10 (IQR 10-20) to 65 (IQR 55-80). Shared decision-making increased when surgeons were reluctant to operate (effect estimate 7.40; 95% CI, 2.60-12.20; P = .003). Longer consultations correlated with higher OPTION5 scores (effect estimate 0.69; 95% CI, 0.52-0.88; P < .001), though 57% of high-scoring consultations were 26 minutes or less. No adverse events were reported.\n\nInterpretation: Shared decision-making varies significantly among surgeons, with effective engagement possible in under 30 minutes. Surgeons are more likely to engage in shared decision-making when surgery is less clearly beneficial. Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02623335. Funding: Not specified.",
