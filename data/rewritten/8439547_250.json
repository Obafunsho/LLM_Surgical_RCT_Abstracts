A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Initial Surgical Treatment in Premature Infants with NEC or IP\n\nBackground: The impact of initial laparotomy versus peritoneal drainage on death or neurodevelopmental impairment (NDI) in extremely low birth weight infants with necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) or isolated intestinal perforation (IP) is unknown.\n\nMethods: In a multicenter randomised controlled trial conducted at 20 US centers, 310 infants were randomised to initial laparotomy or peritoneal drainage. The primary outcome was a composite of death or NDI at 18–22 months corrected age. Randomisation was stratified by center and preoperative diagnosis, with allocation concealment ensured. Blinding was not feasible due to the nature of the interventions.\n\nResults: Of 992 eligible infants, 310 were randomised, and 96% had the primary outcome assessed. Death or NDI occurred in 69% of infants in the laparotomy group versus 70% with drainage (adjusted relative risk [aRR] = 1.0; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.87–1.14). A preplanned analysis identified an interaction between preoperative diagnosis and treatment group (p = 0.03). For NEC, death or NDI occurred in 69% after laparotomy versus 85% with drainage (aRR=0.81; 95% CI: 0.64 to 1.04). For IP, death or NDI occurred in 69% after laparotomy versus 63% with drainage (aRR, 1.11; 95% CI: 0.95 to 1.31).\n\nInterpretation: There was no overall difference in death or NDI rates between initial laparotomy versus drainage. However, the preoperative diagnosis of NEC or IP modified the impact of initial treatment.\n\nTrial registration: [Trial registration number]\n\nFunding: [Source of funding]",
