A 250-word version\n\nTitle: A Randomised Controlled Trial of Robotic-Assisted Versus Conventional Total Knee Arthroplasty\n\nBackground: This randomised controlled trial aimed to compare robotic-assisted total knee arthroplasty (TKA) with conventional TKA in terms of long-term functional outcomes, radiographic parameters, survivorship, and complications.\n\nMethods: Conducted from January 2002 to February 2008, this trial included 1406 eligible patients at a single center. Participants were randomized to receive either robotic-assisted TKA (700 patients, 750 knees) or conventional TKA (706 patients, 766 knees). Randomisation was performed using a computer-generated sequence with allocation concealment. Blinding was not specified. The primary outcome was the Knee Society score, assessed preoperatively and at a mean follow-up of 13 years. Sample size calculation assumed a 5-point difference in the Knee Society score with 99% power, requiring 628 patients per group.\n\nResults: At follow-up, 674 patients in each group were analyzed using an intention-to-treat approach. No significant differences were found in Knee Society scores (robotic: 93 ± 5, conventional: 92 ± 6; p = 0.321), WOMAC scores, or UCLA activity scores. Radiographic parameters and Kaplan-Meier survivorship (98% in both groups) were similar. Complications were comparable, with 2% of knees in each group experiencing superficial infections.\n\nInterpretation: Robotic-assisted TKA did not demonstrate superior functional outcomes, survivorship, or reduced complications compared to conventional TKA. Given the additional costs, its widespread use is not recommended.\n\nTrial registration: [Provide registration number]\n\nFunding: [Provide funding source]",
