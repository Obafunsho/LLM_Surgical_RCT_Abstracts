A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial on Medium-Term Restenosis Rates in Carotid Endarterectomy with Biological vs. Synthetic Patches\n\nBackground: Carotid endarterectomy (CEA) with patch angioplasty is associated with lower restenosis rates compared to primary closure. However, the superiority of patch materials in mitigating restenosis remains unclear.\n\nMethods: This single-centre retrospective study identified all primary CEA with patch angioplasty performed between 2007 and 2019 at a university hospital. Participants included patients with symptomatic or asymptomatic 50–99% internal carotid artery stenosis. The primary outcome was moderate (50–69%) and critical (70–99%) restenosis, defined by duplex ultrasonography criteria. Bovine pericardium served as the biological patch, while Dacron, ePTFE, and polyester-urethane were synthetic comparators. Chi-square tests and Kaplan-Meier curves compared restenosis rates.\n\nResults: A total of 127 CEAs were analysed, with 75 using bovine pericardium. Median follow-up was 40 months. Moderate restenosis occurred in 14 CEAs (11%), and critical restenosis in 10 (7.8%). Bovine patches were significantly associated with >50% restenosis (p = 0.042) but not >70% (p = 0.197). Kaplan-Meier curves showed similar restenosis rates at five years (p = 0.081 and p = 0.080). No significant differences in peri-operative complications were observed between patch types. Adverse events included neck haematomas (2.1%), patch infections (1.4%), and patch thrombosis (1.4%).\n\nInterpretation: Medium-term restenosis rates after CEA are similar between biological and synthetic patches. Randomised controlled trials are needed to determine the superior patch material for carotid reconstruction. The study was not registered, and funding sources were not disclosed.",
