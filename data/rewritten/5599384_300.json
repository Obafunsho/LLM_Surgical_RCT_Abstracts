A 300-word version\n\nTitle: A Randomised Controlled Trial of Perturbation Training in Postoperative ACL Rehabilitation\n\nBackground: This study aimed to assess the impact of perturbation training on postoperative ACL rehabilitation outcomes compared to standard care.\n\nMethods: In this single-blind randomised controlled trial, 40 male participants who completed ACL reconstruction rehabilitation were randomised into two groups: SAP (strengthening, agility, and secondary prevention) and SAP+PERT (SAP with perturbation training). Participants were eligible if they were 3–9 months post-ACL reconstruction, had >80% quadriceps strength limb symmetry, no pain, full ROM, and minimal effusion. The primary outcome was quadriceps strength and single-legged hop limb symmetry, measured at 1 and 2 years post-surgery. Secondary outcomes included patient-reported knee scores and time to pass return-to-sport criteria. Randomisation was computer-generated, and outcome assessors were blinded. \n\nResults: At 1 year, quadriceps symmetry was similar between groups (SAP = 101% ± 14%, SAP+PERT = 101% ± 14%). At 2 years, SAP showed 103% ± 11% and SAP+PERT 98% ± 14% symmetry. No significant differences were found in patient-reported outcomes or time to pass return-to-sport criteria. However, fewer SAP+PERT participants achieved normal knee function at 2 years (SAP 17/17, SAP+PERT 14/19, p = 0.03). No adverse events were reported.\n\nInterpretation: Perturbation training did not provide additional benefits over SAP alone in postoperative ACL rehabilitation. The findings suggest that the inclusion of perturbation training may not enhance functional recovery or patient-reported outcomes in this context.\n\nTrial registration: [Trial registration number]\n\nFunding: [Source of funding]",
