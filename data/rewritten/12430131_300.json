A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Coenzyme Q10 Supplementation on Cognitive Function\n\nBackground: With an aging population, cognitive decline is increasingly significant. Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10), an antioxidant, may improve biological mechanisms underlying cognitive decline. This study evaluates the efficacy of CoQ10 supplementation on cognitive function.\n\nMethods: This review included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of CoQ10 supplementation on cognition in healthy participants and those with specific diseases. The primary outcome was cognitive function, measured over various timeframes. Randomisation methods and allocation concealment were not specified. Blinding details were not provided.\n\nResults: Twelve studies demonstrated improved cognitive function, and two showed reduced oxidative stress with CoQ10 supplementation. Out of eight human RCTs, four showed beneficial effects on cognition, and two demonstrated increased cerebral blood flow. Disparities in results may be due to differing testing procedures, inconsistent cognitive assessments, and varying CoQ10 bioavailability. Adverse events were not reported.\n\nInterpretation: CoQ10 supplementation may positively impact cognition and its biological mechanisms. However, mixed results in human trials highlight the need for further research targeting specific mechanisms and using diverse cognitive assessments. Future studies should address methodological inconsistencies and explore CoQ10's effects on various cognitive domains. Trial registration and funding sources were not provided.",
