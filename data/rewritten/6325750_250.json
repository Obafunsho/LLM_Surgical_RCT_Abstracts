Eligible participants were those scheduled for PD, excluding those with severe comorbidities or requiring additional organ resection. The primary outcome was the incidence of grade B/C POPF within 90 days, defined by the International Study Group on Pancreatic Fistula criteria. Randomisation was computerised with a permuted block size of 4, stratified by pancreatic texture. Blinding was not applied. The trial was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT01898780).\n\nResults: A total of 103 patients in the interrupted suture group and 107 in the modified Blumgart group were analysed by intention-to-treat. Grade B/C POPF occurred in 7 patients (6.8%) in the interrupted group and 11 (10.3%) in the modified Blumgart group (P = 0.367). Mortality within 90 days was 0 in both groups. No significant differences in postoperative complications were observed.\n\nInterpretation: The modified Blumgart mattress suture did not significantly reduce the incidence of clinically relevant POPF compared to the interrupted suture. The study was funded by institutional sources.",
