A 300-word version\n\nTitle: A Randomised Controlled Trial Comparing Plate and Intramedullary Nail Fixation for Displaced Midshaft Clavicle Fractures\n\nBackground: This study aimed to evaluate the long-term outcomes of plate versus intramedullary nail fixation for displaced midshaft clavicle fractures, focusing on disability, implant-related irritation, and removal rates.\n\nMethods: In this randomised controlled trial, 120 patients with displaced midshaft clavicle fractures were enrolled between January 2011 and August 2012. Participants were randomised to receive either plate fixation (n=58) or intramedullary nail fixation (n=62). The primary outcome was disability, assessed using the QuickDASH score at a minimum followup of 30 months (mean, 39 months). Randomisation was conducted using a computer-generated sequence, and allocation was concealed. Blinding was not specified. The study was conducted in a clinical setting, with eligibility criteria including patients with displaced midshaft clavicle fractures.\n\nResults: QuickDASH scores indicated no significant difference between the plate (1.8 ± 3.6) and intramedullary nail groups (1.8 ± 7.2; mean difference, −0.7; 95% CI, −2.2 to 2.04; p=0.95). The incidence of implant-related irritation was similar between groups (70% vs. 66%; relative risk, 1.05; 95% CI, 0.82–1.35; p=0.683). However, intramedullary fixation was associated with a higher rate of implant removal (82% vs. 50%; relative risk, 1.65; 95% CI, 1.24–2.19; p<0.001). No major complications, such as infections, implant breakage, nonunions, or refractures, occurred after the 1-year followup.\n\nInterpretation: Both fixation methods resulted in excellent disability scores. Implant-related irritation was a frequent issue, leading to high removal rates. Future research should focus on identifying risk factors for implant irritation or removal.\n\nTrial registration: Not provided. Funding: Not reported.",
