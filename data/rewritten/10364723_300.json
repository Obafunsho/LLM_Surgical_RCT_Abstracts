Participants were randomised 1:1 to imaging or observation groups using computer-based block randomisation with allocation concealment via a web-based system. The primary outcome was the number of patients requiring treatment for acute appendicitis within 30 days. The analysis followed the intention-to-treat principle.\n\nResults: Between May 2016 and March 2020, 185 patients were randomised: 93 to imaging and 92 to observation. After exclusions, 93 and 88 patients were analysed, respectively. In the imaging group, 72% required treatment for appendicitis compared to 57% in the observation group (odds ratio 0.51, 95% CI 0.27 to 0.95; p = 0.032). No significant difference was observed in complicated appendicitis (4% vs 2%) or negative appendicectomies (1% vs 1%). No adverse events were reported. Observation led to fewer CT scans within 30 days (34% vs 72%).\n\nInterpretation: Score-based observation reduces the number of patients requiring treatment for appendicitis compared to early imaging, suggesting that some cases of appendicitis may resolve spontaneously. This approach also decreases the need for diagnostic imaging, reducing exposure to ionizing radiation. Trial registration: NCT02742402. Funding: Not specified.",
