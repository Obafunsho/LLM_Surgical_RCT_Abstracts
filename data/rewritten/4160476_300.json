A 300-word version\n\nTitle: A Randomised Controlled Trial Comparing MRI- and CT-based Patient-Specific Instrumentation with Conventional Instrumentation in Total Knee Arthroplasty\n\nBackground: This study aimed to evaluate the accuracy and clinical outcomes of MRI- and CT-based patient-specific instrumentation compared to conventional instrumentation in total knee arthroplasty (TKA).\n\nMethods: Ninety patients undergoing primary TKA were randomised into three groups: MRI-based, CT-based patient-specific instrumentation, and conventional instrumentation. The primary outcome was the accuracy of coronal and sagittal alignment, assessed postoperatively. Secondary outcomes included component rotation, clinical outcomes (Knee Society and WOMAC scores), and duration of surgery. Randomisation was computer-generated, with allocation concealment. Outcome assessors were blinded. The study was conducted at [study setting]. Sample size was determined to detect a clinically significant difference in alignment accuracy.\n\nResults: MRI- and CT-based instrumentation demonstrated higher accuracy in coronal limb axis compared to conventional instrumentation (MRI: 1.0° vs. 4.5°, p < 0.001; CT: 3.0° vs. 4.5°, p = 0.02). MRI-based instrumentation was more accurate than CT-based in coronal mechanical limb axis (1.0° vs. 3.0°, p = 0.03). Both patient-specific groups had reduced surgery duration compared to conventional (MRI: 58 minutes vs. 76 minutes, p < 0.001; CT: 63 minutes vs. 76 minutes, p < 0.001). No significant differences were observed in postoperative Knee Society and WOMAC scores. No adverse events were reported.\n\nInterpretation: Patient-specific instrumentation enhances accuracy over conventional methods, with MRI-based being more precise than CT-based for coronal alignment. Despite these findings, the clinical relevance is limited, and no differences in long-term outcomes were noted. Trial registration: [Trial registration number]. Funding: [Source of funding]. Further research is needed to assess long-term benefits and cost-effectiveness.",
