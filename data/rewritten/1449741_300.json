A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Magnesium Therapy in Carotid Endarterectomy\n\nBackground: While magnesium offers cerebral protection in animal stroke models, its application in humans is hindered by side effects. This study investigates the incidence of α-agonist treated hypotension in patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy.\n\nMethods: This prospective, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase I/IIa dose escalation trial involved 80 patients undergoing elective carotid endarterectomy. Participants were randomised to a placebo group (n = 38) or one of three intravenous magnesium groups. Randomisation was computer-generated, and allocation was concealed. Eligibility criteria included [eligibility criteria]. The study was conducted at [study setting]. Magnesium levels were measured at baseline and at 15 minutes, 1 hour, 2 hours, 6 hours, 12 hours, and 24 hours post-infusion. The primary outcome was the amount and duration of phenylephrine required to maintain target systolic blood pressure post-surgery. Blinding included patients, clinicians, and outcome assessors.\n\nResults: All treatment groups achieved significantly different magnesium levels from baseline at 12 and 24 hours (P < 0.01). There was no significant increase in the proportion of patients requiring pressure support in the magnesium groups compared to controls. The amount and duration of phenylephrine required were similar across groups, regardless of magnesium dose. No adverse events were reported.\n\nInterpretation: Magnesium therapy did not significantly affect the need for postoperative pressor support compared to placebo. The requirement for pressure support was influenced by the minimum systolic blood pressure ordered post-surgery. The study suggests that magnesium can be safely administered without increasing the need for pressor support.\n\nTrial registration: [Trial registration number]\n\nFunding: [Source of funding]",
