A 250-word version\n\nTitle: A Randomised Controlled Trial Comparing Dexmedetomidine and Ketorolac for Postoperative Pain Management in Appendectomy\n\nBackground: This study aimed to evaluate the preemptive/preventive effects of dexmedetomidine versus ketorolac on postoperative pain in appendectomy patients.\n\nMethods: Conducted at Shahid Mohammadi Hospital, Iran, 60 patients aged 18-65 years undergoing appendectomy were randomised into three groups: dexmedetomidine (n=20), ketorolac (n=20), and control (n=20). Eligibility criteria included ASA class I and II, excluding those with allergies, drug use, or complicated appendicitis. Randomisation was computer-generated with allocation concealment via sealed envelopes. Blinding included patients, outcome assessors, and clinicians. The primary outcome was VAS pain scores at 1, 3, 6, 12, and 24 hours postoperatively. Secondary outcomes included 24-hour cumulative fentanyl PCA dose. Sample size was calculated based on VAS scores from a pilot study.\n\nResults: Dexmedetomidine group showed significantly lower VAS scores at 12 and 24 hours (1.15 ± 1.98 and 0.95 ± 1.76, P=0.004 and P=0.003) compared to ketorolac and control. Cumulative fentanyl PCA was lower in the dexmedetomidine group (21.35 ± 11.77 mL) than control (40.35 ± 12.90 mL, P=0.003). No significant adverse events were reported.\n\nInterpretation: Dexmedetomidine demonstrated superior preemptive/preventive analgesic effects compared to ketorolac and control, reducing pain scores and fentanyl use postoperatively.\n\nTrial registration: IRCT20140615018091N9\n\nFunding: Not specified.",
