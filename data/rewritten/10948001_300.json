This study evaluates the feasibility of acupuncture as a safer alternative for acute pain management in the ED.\n\nMethods: This NIH-funded multi-site feasibility study employed a randomised controlled trial design. Participants were eligible if they presented with acute pain in the ED, including trauma, low back pain, abdominal pain, musculoskeletal pain, renal colic, or headache. The intervention group received a flexible acupuncture treatment tailored to common ED scenarios, while the control group received usual care. Randomisation was conducted using a computer-generated sequence, and allocation was concealed. Blinding was not feasible for patients and clinicians, but outcome assessors were blinded. The primary outcome was pain reduction, measured immediately post-intervention.\n\nResults: A total of 200 participants were randomised, with 100 in each group, recruited between January 2020 and June 2021. Data from 98 participants in the intervention group and 97 in the control group were analysed using an intention-to-treat approach. The intervention group demonstrated a significant reduction in pain compared to the control group (mean difference = 5.2 mm Hg, 95% CI 3.1 to 7.3; p = 0.01). Adverse events were mild, occurring in 3% of the intervention group and 1% of the control group.\n\nInterpretation: The findings indicate that acupuncture is a feasible and potentially effective alternative for acute pain management in the ED. The results support the need for a larger, definitive trial to further explore its efficacy and safety.\n\nTrial registration: NCT04880733 (ClinicalTrials.gov).\n\nFunding: This study was funded by the National Institutes of Health.",
