This study aimed to assess the efficacy of recombinant human brain natriuretic peptide (rh-BNP) in enhancing renal function in patients with AKI post-CABG.\n\nMethods: Conducted at The Affiliated Hospital of Qingdao University, this single-center retrospective study included patients diagnosed with AKI within 4 days post-CABG from January 2016 to December 2020. Participants were divided into BNP and non-BNP groups based on intravenous rh-BNP administration. The primary outcome was the change in serum creatinine levels and urine volume within 4 days post-surgery. Multivariable logistic regression and propensity score matching (PSM) were employed to adjust for confounding factors.\n\nResults: A total of 395 patients were included, with 56 in the BNP group and 339 in the non-BNP group. The BNP group exhibited a significant decrease in serum creatinine levels (P<0.001) and increased urine volume (P=0.001) compared to the non-BNP group. After PSM, 175 patients were analyzed, with the BNP group showing a stronger decrease in creatinine levels (0.04±0.28 vs. −0.16±0.36, P=0.001) and higher urine volume (11.3±2.8 vs. 9.11±2.66, P<0.001). No significant difference in diuretic dosage was observed (P=0.852).\n\nInterpretation: The administration of rh-BNP post-CABG significantly improves renal function by reducing creatinine levels and increasing urine output in patients with AKI. These findings suggest that rh-BNP could be a beneficial therapeutic option for managing AKI in post-CABG patients.\n\nTrial registration: Not provided.\n\nFunding: Not reported.",
