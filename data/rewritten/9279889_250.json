A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial on Antioxidant Therapy in the Perinatal Period\n\nBackground: Oxidative stress, resulting from an imbalance between reactive oxygen/nitrogen species and antioxidants, is implicated in adverse pregnancy outcomes and fetal programming. This study evaluates the efficacy of antioxidant therapy in mitigating oxidative stress-related complications during the perinatal period.\n\nMethods: This randomised controlled trial was conducted at a tertiary care center. Participants included pregnant women at risk of oxidative stress-related complications. Eligibility criteria included maternal age 18-40 years and gestational age 20-28 weeks. Participants were randomised using a computer-generated sequence with allocation concealment via sealed envelopes. The intervention group received antioxidant therapy, while the control group received a placebo. Blinding was maintained for outcome assessors, patients, and clinicians.\n\nResults: A total of 200 participants were randomised: 100 to the intervention group and 100 to the control group, between January 2020 and June 2021. The primary outcome was the incidence of preterm birth, measured until delivery. The intervention group showed a significant reduction in preterm birth rates compared to the control group (mean difference = 10%, 95% CI 5% to 15%; p = 0.01). Adverse events were mild and occurred in 3% of the intervention group and 1% of the control group.\n\nInterpretation: Antioxidant therapy significantly reduces the risk of preterm birth in women at risk of oxidative stress-related complications. Further research is needed to explore long-term outcomes.\n\nTrial registration: NCT12345678\n\nFunding: This trial was funded by the National Institutes of Health.",
