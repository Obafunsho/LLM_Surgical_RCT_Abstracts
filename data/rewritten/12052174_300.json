A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Automatic Remifentanil Administration in Burn Surgery: A Randomised Controlled Trial\n\nBackground: This randomised controlled trial assessed the clinical efficacy and safety of an expert system for automatic remifentanil administration during propofol anesthesia in burn surgery.\n\nMethods: Conducted at the Burn Center of the University Hospital of Lille, France, from June 2018 to June 2022, 52 adult patients were randomised into two groups: automatic remifentanil infusion using the ANI-REMI-LOOP software or manual infusion (standard practice). Eligibility criteria included ASA I–III patients scheduled for burn excision and skin grafts. The primary outcome was the cumulative remifentanil dose during anesthesia. Secondary outcomes included hemodynamic stability and postoperative pain. Randomisation was performed using permutated blocks of four, and patients were blinded to group allocation. The analysis was conducted on a per-protocol basis.\n\nResults: The automatic group received a significantly lower cumulative remifentanil dose (0.125 µg.kg⁻¹.min⁻¹ [0.106 to 0.149]) compared to the manual group (0.152 µg.kg⁻¹.min⁻¹ [0.137 to 0.237], p = 0.004). Hemodynamic impairment was lower in the automatic group (4.2% [2.5 to 5.7]) versus the manual group (19.4% [6.9 to 59.9], p = 0.010). No significant differences in postoperative pain or analgesic requirements were observed. No adverse events related to the intervention were reported.\n\nInterpretation: Automatic remifentanil administration using the ANI-REMI-LOOP software demonstrated reduced remifentanil use and improved hemodynamic stability without compromising safety. These findings suggest potential applicability to other surgical settings, although further trials are needed to confirm these results across different types of surgeries.\n\nTrial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT03556696.\n\nFunding: Not specified.",
