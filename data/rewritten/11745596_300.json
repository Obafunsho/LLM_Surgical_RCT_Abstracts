A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Cost-Effectiveness of Dual Hypothermic Oxygenated Machine Perfusion in DCD Liver Transplantation: A Randomised Controlled Trial\n\nBackground: This study assesses the cost-effectiveness of dual hypothermic oxygenated machine perfusion (DHOPE) versus static cold storage (SCS) in donation after circulatory death (DCD) liver transplantation.\n\nMethods: Conducted as a multicenter randomised controlled trial (DHOPE-DCD trial; ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT02584283), patients were randomised to receive a DCD liver preserved with either DHOPE or SCS. The trial took place in three Dutch liver transplant centers. The primary outcome was the cost-effectiveness of DHOPE, evaluated by total medical costs up to one year posttransplant. Randomisation was computer-generated, with allocation concealment. Patients and organ procurement teams were blinded to group allocation. Costs were calculated using three scenarios: (1) machine perfusion costs, (2) machine perfusion plus personnel costs, and (3) scenario 2 plus depreciation for a dedicated organ perfusion room.\n\nResults: A total of 119 patients were randomised: 60 to DHOPE and 59 to SCS. The mean total cost per patient was €110,794 for DHOPE and €126,221 for SCS, with significant reductions in intensive care costs (28.4%) and nonsurgical interventions (24.3%). DHOPE was cost-effective after one procedure in scenario 1, and after 25 and 30 procedures per year in scenarios 2 and 3, respectively. The analysis was conducted on an intention-to-treat basis. No adverse events were reported.\n\nInterpretation: DHOPE is cost-effective in DCD liver transplantation, reducing total medical costs up to one year posttransplant. The study was funded by national healthcare bodies, supporting the integration of DHOPE into routine clinical practice. The findings highlight the potential for improved patient outcomes and cost-effective resource utilization in liver transplantation.",
