A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of NeuroPort™ Microelectrode Array in Epilepsy Monitoring\n\nBackground: Investigating cortical physiology at a submillimeter scale necessitates precise recording of brain electrical activity. Standard intracranial electrodes average potentials from large neuron populations, whereas microelectrode arrays (MEA) enable local field potentials (LFPs) and single-unit activity recording.\n\nMethods: In this randomised controlled trial, seven patients undergoing subdural electrode implantation for epilepsy monitoring were included. Eligibility required the need for epilepsy monitoring, and participants were implanted with the NeuroPort™ MEA in putative non-eloquent epileptogenic cortex. The primary outcome was the successful recording of LFPs and single-unit activity over 3–28 days. Randomisation and allocation concealment methods were not specified. Blinding was not applicable.\n\nResults: Successful MEA implantation was achieved in all patients with minor operative difficulties. Robust and durable LFPs and single-unit recordings were obtained from all individuals. Histological analysis of implanted tissue demonstrated no significant tissue injury or inflammatory response. There were no neurological complications or infections associated with electrode implantation or prolonged monitoring. Two patients developed post-resection wound healing issues at the site of scalp egress, with one requiring operative wound revision.\n\nInterpretation: Our findings indicate that semi-chronic micro-EEG recording using the NeuroPort™ microarray is both safe and effective. Although significant tissue injury, infection, or CSF leak were not encountered, the large profile of the connection pedestal resulted in suboptimal wound closure and healing in several patients. This problem is anticipated to be addressed in second-generation devices.\n\nTrial registration: Not provided.\n\nFunding: Not specified.",
