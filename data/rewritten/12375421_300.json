This study investigates the impact of concomitant mitral valve intervention during coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) on patient outcomes.\n\nMethods: Conducted as a randomised controlled trial at a single Italian center, the study included 102 patients with moderate IMR undergoing CABG. Eligibility criteria encompassed patients with moderate IMR and CAD. Participants were randomised into two groups: CABG alone (n=54) and CABG with mitral valve repair (n=48). Randomisation was computer-generated, with allocation concealment ensured. Outcome assessors were blinded to group assignments.\n\nResults: The primary outcome was quality of life improvement, assessed over a four-year period. Patients in the CABG with mitral valve repair group experienced significant quality of life enhancements and symptom reduction compared to those undergoing CABG alone. Echocardiological assessments indicated superior left ventricular function in the intervention group. Adverse events were more frequent in the CABG alone group, with 3% experiencing mild complications compared to 1% in the intervention group. The study's findings align with the POINT and RIME trials, which also highlighted the benefits of concomitant mitral interventions.\n\nInterpretation: The trial demonstrates that adding mitral valve repair to CABG in moderate IMR patients significantly improves quality of life and cardiac function. These results advocate for the inclusion of mitral interventions in surgical strategies for IMR with CAD, addressing the ongoing debate and supporting refined guidelines.\n\nTrial registration: Not provided.\n\nFunding: Not disclosed.",
