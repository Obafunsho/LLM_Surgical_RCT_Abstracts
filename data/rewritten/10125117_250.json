A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Sitagliptin for Prevention of Posttransplant Diabetes Mellitus\n\nBackground: Posttransplant diabetes mellitus (PTDM) is a common complication following kidney transplantation. This study evaluates the efficacy of sitagliptin in preventing PTDM in kidney transplant recipients.\n\nMethods: This single-center, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was conducted at Washington University in Saint Louis. Participants were adults aged 18 years or older who received a kidney transplant and exhibited postoperative hyperglycemia. Exclusion criteria included a history of diabetes. Participants were randomised using block randomisation to receive sitagliptin or placebo, with allocation concealed by a research pharmacist. The primary outcome was the improvement of 2-hour oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) by >20 mg/dL at 3 months posttransplant. The study was powered to detect a mean difference of 20 mg/dL in 2-hour OGTT with 80.7% power.\n\nResults: Sixty-one patients were randomised, 32 to sitagliptin and 29 to placebo. Fifty patients were analysed using an intention-to-treat approach. At 3 months, the 2-hour OGTT was 141.00 ± 62.44 mg/dL in the sitagliptin group and 165.22 ± 72.03 mg/dL in the placebo group (p = 0.218). No significant differences in HbA1c were observed. Sitagliptin was well tolerated, with similar adverse event rates in both groups.\n\nInterpretation: Although sitagliptin did not significantly improve 2-hour OGTT compared to placebo, the findings can inform future studies on PTDM prevention.
