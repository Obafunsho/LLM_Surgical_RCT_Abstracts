This study evaluates non-surgical interventions to prevent CLL tissue loss and amputation.\n\nMethods: A randomised controlled trial was conducted with 50 dysvascular amputees. Participants were randomised to receive electrostimulation of the gastrocnemius muscle plus standard rehabilitation or standard rehabilitation alone. The primary outcome was the incidence of new major amputation of the CLL over 12 months. Randomisation was by birthdate, with unclear allocation concealment. Blinding was not reported.\n\nResults: Electrostimulation was associated with a three-fold reduction in the incidence of new major amputation of the CLL (RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.04 to 2.99). No new incidence of tissue loss was reported. There was no difference in 12-month survival between groups (RR 1.0, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.18). Adverse events and hospital readmissions were not reported. The overall certainty of evidence was very low, with high risk of performance bias.\n\nInterpretation: Electrostimulation may reduce the risk of major amputation in dysvascular amputees, but evidence is limited by high bias risk. Further research is needed to confirm these findings.\n\nTrial registration: Protocol available via DOI 10.1002/14651858.CD013857\n\nFunding: No dedicated funding.",
