A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Continuous Pressure Monitoring in Regional Anesthesia\n\nBackground: Accurate localization of interfascial planes is crucial for effective regional anesthesia, yet ultrasound guidance can be challenging in certain populations. This study evaluates whether continuous monitoring of injection pressure can differentiate interfascial spaces from surrounding structures in a porcine model.\n\nMethods: This randomised controlled trial was conducted on porcine thighs, with randomisation at the interfascial space level. A custom-built pressure monitoring system continuously measured saline injection pressure during ultrasound-guided regional block procedures. Needle positions were classified as intramuscular, resting on fascia, or interfascial. Statistical analyses included Wilcoxon signed-rank tests and regression analysis.\n\nResults: Mean intramuscular pressure was significantly higher than mean interfascial pressure (p < 1 × 10^−13). Interfascial injections showed lower pressure variability (p = 2.1 × 10^−4) and an increasing pressure trend over time (p = 2.1 × 10^−4), while intramuscular injections exhibited a decreasing trend (p = 3.15 × 10^−3). No adverse events were reported.\n\nInterpretation: Continuous pressure monitoring effectively distinguishes interfascial from intramuscular and fascial penetration phases, enhancing needle guidance and improving the safety and accuracy of interfascial plane blocks. Further studies are warranted to validate these findings.\n\nFunding: The study was funded by grant RW/36/25.",
