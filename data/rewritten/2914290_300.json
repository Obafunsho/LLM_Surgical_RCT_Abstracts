A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Early Active Mobilization vs. Immobilization After Tibialis Posterior Tendon Transfer: A Randomized Controlled Trial\n\nBackground: This randomized controlled trial assessed the efficacy of early active mobilization compared to immobilization following tibialis posterior tendon transfer for foot-drop correction in patients with Hansen’s disease.\n\nMethods: Conducted at a single institution from July 2005 to June 2006, 24 patients with irreversible common peroneal nerve paralysis were randomized postoperatively to early mobilization (n=13) or immobilization (n=11). Randomization was achieved using sealed opaque envelopes, with allocation concealed until after surgery. The primary outcome was rehabilitation time, defined as the duration from surgery to independent walking, with a minimum follow-up of 16 months. Blinding was not feasible for therapists, but outcome assessors were blinded. A power analysis determined that a sample size of 10 per group was adequate to detect a 10-day difference in rehabilitation time.\n\nResults: No tendon insertion pullout occurred in either group. The mobilized group experienced a significant reduction in rehabilitation time by an average of 15 days (p<0.001). Functional outcomes, including active ankle dorsiflexion, plantar flexion, and ROM, were comparable between groups. No adverse events were reported.\n\nInterpretation: Early active mobilization post-tendon transfer for foot-drop correction in Hansen’s disease patients is effective, reducing rehabilitation time without increasing the risk of tendon pullout or compromising functional outcomes compared to immobilization. This approach facilitates earlier restoration of independent walking.\n\nTrial registration: Not provided.\n\nFunding: Not specified.",
