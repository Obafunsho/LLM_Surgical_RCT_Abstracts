Participants were divided based on guideline adherence. The primary outcome was long-term RC-AVF failure, monitored over a mean follow-up of 1.98 years.\n\nResults: Patients with RC-AVF created outside guideline recommendations exhibited smaller arterial (p < 0.001) and venous (p < 0.001) diameters, higher central venous catheter (CVC) use at creation (p = 0.041), and increased 6-week (p = 0.012) and long-term AVF failure (p = 0.016). ROC analysis determined optimal thresholds of 2.75 mm for radial artery and 2.52 mm for cephalic vein. Adherence to guidelines correlated with reduced long-term failure (HR: 0.44, p = 0.012), but this lost significance after adjusting for cardiovascular risk factors and CVC presence (HR: 0.69, p = 0.328). Only cephalic vein diameter remained an independent predictor (HR: 0.68, p = 0.026).\n\nInterpretation: Cephalic vein diameter is a key determinant of long-term RC-AVF success, independent of demographic and cardiovascular factors. While adherence to ESVS guidelines supports functional RC-AVF creation, additional cofactors, such as demographic data, cardiovascular risk factors, and CVC presence, must be considered for optimal long-term outcomes. This study underscores the importance of a comprehensive approach to patient selection and surgical planning.",
