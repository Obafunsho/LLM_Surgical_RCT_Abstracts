A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial Comparing Palonosetron and Ondansetron for PONV Prophylaxis\n\nBackground: Postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) is a common complication in surgeries under general anaesthesia. This study compares the efficacy and safety of palonosetron and ondansetron in preventing PONV in non-laparoscopic surgeries.\n\nMethods: This randomised controlled trial included patients undergoing non-laparoscopic surgeries. Participants were randomly assigned to receive either intravenous palonosetron or ondansetron for PONV prophylaxis. The primary outcome was the incidence of nausea and vomiting at postoperative time points: 0–2 hours, 0–6 hours, 12–24 hours, 24–48 hours, and 24–72 hours. Randomisation was computer-generated, and allocation was concealed. Blinding was applied to outcome assessors, patients, and clinicians. A total of 1681 participants were randomised: 842 to palonosetron and 839 to ondansetron.\n\nResults: Palonosetron significantly reduced nausea and vomiting beyond 6 hours compared to ondansetron. The pooled risk ratio (RR) for nausea at 12–24 hours was 0.39 (95% CI: 0.16, 0.96), and for vomiting at 24–48 hours was 0.24 (95% CI: 0.09, 0.62). Safety profiles were comparable, with similar incidences of headache, dizziness, drowsiness, and constipation.\n\nInterpretation: Palonosetron provides superior PONV prophylaxis beyond 6 hours compared to ondansetron in non-laparoscopic surgeries. Both drugs have similar safety profiles. Trial registration: PROSPERO CRD42023426785. Funding: Not reported.",
