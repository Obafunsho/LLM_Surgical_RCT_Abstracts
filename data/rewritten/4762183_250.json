A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Impact of Patient Characteristics on Insulin Response During Non-Cardiac Surgery: A Randomised Controlled Trial\n\nBackground: Patient characteristics such as body weight and diabetes status may influence insulin response during surgery. This study aimed to evaluate these effects in non-cardiac surgical patients.\n\nMethods: This randomised controlled trial was conducted as part of the DeLiT Trial. A total of 202 patients undergoing non-cardiac surgery were enrolled and received intraoperative intravenous insulin. Participants were randomised using a computer-generated sequence, with allocation concealed via sealed envelopes. Eligibility criteria included adult patients scheduled for non-cardiac surgery. The primary outcome was the change in blood glucose concentration 30 minutes after an initial insulin bolus. Blinding was applied to outcome assessors.\n\nResults: Of the 202 patients, 101 were randomised to each group. Analysis was performed on all participants using an intention-to-treat approach. Blood glucose concentrations decreased by 8.3 ±10 mg dl-1 (0.46 ± 0.56 mmol litre-1) per unit of insulin. The response was similar in patients with and without diabetes [adjusted mean difference (97.5% CI): 0.2 (-3.9, 4.2) mg dl-1, 0.01 (-0.22, 0.24) mmol litre-1, P = 0.93]. No significant relationship was found between insulin response and body weight. No adverse events were reported.\n\nInterpretation: The findings suggest that body weight and diabetes status do not significantly affect intraoperative insulin response, indicating that adjustments for these factors may not be necessary in treatment algorithms.\n\nTrial registration: [Trial registration number]\n\nFunding: [Source of funding]",
