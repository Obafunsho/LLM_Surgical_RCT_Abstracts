A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial Comparing Proximal Gastrectomy with Double-Tract Reconstruction to Total Gastrectomy in Early-Stage Proximal Gastric Cancer\n\nBackground: Total gastrectomy (TG) is the standard for proximal gastric cancer but often leads to nutritional and metabolic issues. This study evaluates proximal gastrectomy with double-tract reconstruction (PG-DTR) versus TG with Roux-en-Y reconstruction (TG-RY) in early-stage proximal gastric cancer.\n\nMethods: In this randomised controlled trial, patients with cT1 to cT2 proximal gastric cancer were recruited at Fujian Cancer Hospital. Eligibility included histologically confirmed adenocarcinoma and no severe comorbidities. Participants were randomised to PG-DTR or TG-RY. The primary outcome was nutritional status at 3 months, measured by body weight, hemoglobin, and albumin levels. Secondary outcomes included surgical outcomes, reflux esophagitis, and quality of life (QOL) assessed at 3, 6, and 12 months using the PGSAS-45. Randomisation was computer-generated, with allocation concealment. Blinding was not applied.\n\nResults: 186 patients were randomised: 93 to PG-DTR and 93 to TG-RY. Analysis was per-protocol. PG-DTR demonstrated superior nutritional status at 3 months (mean difference in hemoglobin = 1.2 g/dL, 95% CI 0.8 to 1.6; p < 0.01). No significant differences were observed in surgical outcomes, reflux esophagitis, or QOL. Adverse events were similar between groups, with no severe complications reported.\n\nTrial registration: Not provided.\n\nFunding: Supported by institutional funding.",
