A 250-word version\n\nTitle: A Randomised Controlled Trial Comparing Subcutaneous and Intraarticular Indwelling Vacuum Drainage in Total Knee Arthroplasty\n\nBackground: Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) often involves significant bleeding, and the optimal drainage method remains debated. This study evaluates whether subcutaneous indwelling vacuum drainage offers advantages over intraarticular indwelling vacuum drainage in primary TKA.\n\nMethods: In this randomised controlled trial, 111 patients undergoing primary TKA were randomised to receive either subcutaneous or intraarticular indwelling vacuum drainage. The primary outcome was blood loss, measured by hemoglobin decrease and transfusion requirements, assessed over 5 days post-surgery. Secondary outcomes included wound complications and functional outcomes at 12 months. Randomisation was computer-generated, with allocation concealment via sealed envelopes. Blinding was applied to outcome assessors.\n\nResults: A total of 56 patients were randomised to the subcutaneous group and 55 to the intraarticular group. The mean vacuum drainage volume was significantly lower in the subcutaneous group (140 mL) compared to the intraarticular group (352 mL). Hemoglobin decrease and transfusion requirements were similar between groups. No significant differences were observed in wound complications or functional scores. Analysis was conducted on an intention-to-treat basis.\n\nInterpretation: Subcutaneous indwelling vacuum drainage is a viable alternative to intraarticular drainage in TKA, with comparable outcomes in blood loss, wound complications, and functional recovery. No severe adverse events were reported in either group.\n\nTrial registration: [Trial registration number]\n\nFunding: [Source of funding]",
