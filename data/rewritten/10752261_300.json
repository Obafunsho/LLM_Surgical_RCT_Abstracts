A 300-word version\n\nTitle: A Randomised Controlled Trial Comparing Bioactive Glass and Allograft for Benign Bone Lesions in Children\n\nBackground: Benign bone cysts in children have a high risk of recurrence after bone grafting. The optimal treatment and filling material for these lesions are currently unknown.\n\nMethods: This pragmatic multicenter randomised controlled trial compared cyst recurrence after intralesional curettage and filling with allograft versus bioactive glass (BG-S53P4; Bonalive) in children aged 4 to 16 years. Conducted in four university hospitals in a Scandinavian country, the primary outcome was the volume of recurrent cyst at 2-year follow-up. Randomisation was performed using sealed envelopes, and allocation was concealed. Blinding was not possible due to the distinct imaging characteristics of the materials. The sample size calculation indicated 16 patients per group were required, with a total of 50 enrolled to account for potential loss to follow-up.\n\nResults: Of 64 eligible children, 51 were randomised between October 2012 and February 2019 to undergo filling with morselized allograft (26) or bioactive glass (25). Twelve (46%) in the allograft group and 10 (40%) in the bioactive glass group developed a recurrence (OR = 0.79, 95% CI = 0.25 to 2.56, p = 0.77). The size of the recurrent cyst did not differ significantly between groups. The Musculoskeletal Tumor Society score improved significantly in both groups. Four (15%) in the allograft group and 6 (24%) in the bioactive glass group required reoperation. No significant adverse events were reported.\n\nInterpretation: Filling with bioactive glass and allograft provided comparable results in terms of recurrence and complications. The trial was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04737590) and funded by foundations and national state research funding, with no role in the analyses or writing of the manuscript.",
