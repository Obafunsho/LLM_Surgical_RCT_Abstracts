Participants underwent PLA followed by a 28-day post-ablation MRI and surgical resection. The primary outcome was complete tumor ablation, assessed by pathology. Cell viability was evaluated using H&E, CK8/18, ER, and Ki67 staining. Randomisation and blinding were not applicable.\n\nResults: From June 2012 to May 2015, 61 patients were treated. Complete tumor ablation was confirmed in 51 (84%) patients. MRI-pathology correlation was evaluable in 60 patients, with an MRI negative predictive value of 92.2% (95% CI, 71.9–91.9%). Adverse events were mild to moderate, with no serious events reported.\n\nInterpretation: PLA shows potential as an alternative to surgery for early-stage IDC, with strong MRI-pathology correlation. Further trials are needed to confirm these findings.\n\nTrial registration: Not provided.\n\nFunding: Not specified.",
