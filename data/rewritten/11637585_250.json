A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial on the Effect of Reverse Bevel Nasotracheal Intubation on Epistaxis\n\nBackground: Nasotracheal intubation via the left nostril is associated with a higher incidence of epistaxis compared to the right nostril. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of a 180˚ reverse bevel and tip direction of the nasotracheal tube on the incidence of epistaxis during left nostril intubation.\n\nMethods: In this randomised controlled trial, 74 patients undergoing right-sided maxillofacial surgery requiring left nasotracheal intubation were enrolled at Asan Medical Center, Seoul, Korea, between November 2021 and September 2023. Participants were randomly allocated to the control group (conventional tube direction) or the reverse group (180˚ reverse bevel direction). The primary outcome was the incidence of epistaxis, assessed via videolaryngoscopy. Randomisation was performed using web-based software, with allocation concealment ensured. Outcome assessors were blinded.\n\nResults: The incidence of epistaxis was significantly lower in the reverse group (9/37 [24.3%]) compared to the control group (20/37 [54.1%], P = 0.009; relative risk: 0.45, 95% CI [0.24, 0.85]). The severity of epistaxis was also reduced (P = 0.002). First attempt nasal passage success was higher in the reverse group (P = 0.027). No nasotracheal tube-related complications were reported in either group.\n\nInterpretation: The 180˚ reverse bevel and tip direction significantly reduced the incidence and severity of epistaxis and improved patient satisfaction.
