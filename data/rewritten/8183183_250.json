The primary outcome was surgical morbidity, assessed at 1 month (early) and 2 years (late) post-surgery. Randomisation was performed centrally, and allocation was concealed. Blinding was not applicable. Between March 2007 and September 2012, 148 patients were randomised: 74 to LE and 74 to TME. Intention-to-treat analysis was conducted on 145 patients.\n\nResults: Early surgical morbidity was significantly lower in the LE group (20%) compared to TME (36%) and completion TME (43%) (P = 0.025). Late surgical morbidity was also lower in the LE group (4%) compared to TME (33%) and completion TME (57%) (P < 0.001). No deaths occurred in any group. LE was associated with fewer medical morbidities, though not statistically significant. \n\nInterpretation: LE demonstrated significantly lower early and late surgical morbidity compared to TME, supporting its use as a safe organ-preserving alternative in selected patients.
