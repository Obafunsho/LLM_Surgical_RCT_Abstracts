This post hoc analysis investigates whether TXA reduces the frequency of neurosurgery and improves outcomes in surgically treated patients.\n\nMethods: In this multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, 2325 participants with acute ICH were randomized to receive either TXA or placebo within 8 hours of symptom onset. The primary outcome was the frequency of neurosurgery within 7 days. Randomization was computer-generated, and allocation was concealed. Blinding included patients, clinicians, and outcome assessors. The analysis was intention-to-treat.\n\nResults: Of 2325 participants, 121 (5.2%) underwent neurosurgery, with similar rates in the TXA (4.9%) and placebo (5.5%) groups (OR 0.893; 95% CI 0.619-1.289; P = .545). TXA did not improve outcomes in surgically treated participants (OR 0.79; 95% CI 0.30-2.09; P = .64) or reduce postoperative hematoma volume (mean difference −8.97 mL; 95% CI −23.77 to 5.82; P = .45). Adverse events, including seizures, were more common in surgically treated participants but did not differ significantly between TXA and placebo groups.\n\nInterpretation: TXA was not associated with reduced neurosurgical intervention, decreased hematoma volume, or improved outcomes in surgically treated ICH patients. Further research is needed to explore the timing and potential benefits of TXA in this population.\n\nTrial registration: ISRCTN93732214\n\nFunding: The trial was funded by the National Institute for Health Research.",
