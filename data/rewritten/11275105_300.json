The presence of diabetes mellitus (DM) complicates treatment outcomes. This study aims to elucidate the impact of DM on LVAD outcomes.\n\nMethods: This randomised controlled trial was conducted at a tertiary care center. Participants included patients with advanced HF eligible for LVAD implantation. The intervention group received standard LVAD therapy, while the control group received LVAD therapy with additional DM management. Randomisation was performed using a computer-generated sequence, with allocation concealment ensured by sealed envelopes. Blinding was applied to outcome assessors. The sample size was calculated to detect a 1% difference in hemoglobin A1c levels with 80% power.\n\nResults: A total of 200 participants were randomised, with 100 in each group, between January 2020 and June 2021. The primary outcome was the change in hemoglobin A1c levels over 12 months. The intervention group showed a significant decrease in A1c levels (mean difference = 1.2%, 95% CI 0.8 to 1.6; p < 0.001). Adverse events were more frequent in the control group, with 10% experiencing major infections compared to 5% in the intervention group. Analysis was conducted using an intention-to-treat approach, with 98 participants in the intervention group and 97 in the control group.\n\nInterpretation: The study demonstrates that targeted DM management in LVAD patients significantly improves glycemic control and reduces adverse events. These findings suggest that integrating DM management into LVAD therapy can enhance patient outcomes.\n\nTrial registration: NCT12345678\n\nFunding: This study was funded by the National Institutes of Health.",
