A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Carotid Artery Stenting Using Roadsaver Stent\n\nBackground: Carotid artery stenting (CAS) is a procedure used to prevent stroke in patients with carotid artery stenosis. This study evaluates the safety and effectiveness of the Roadsaver double-nitinol-layer-micromesh stent in CAS.\n\nMethods: This retrospective analysis included 298 CAS procedures in 287 non-consecutive patients (203 men, mean age 70.5 ±8.6 years) with symptomatic or high-risk extracranial carotid artery stenosis. All procedures were performed using proximal (40%) or distal (60%) neuroprotection systems. Clinical and neurological examinations and duplex ultrasound were conducted before CAS, before discharge, at 1, 6, and 12 months, then annually. \n\nResults: All CAS procedures were successful, reducing carotid stenosis from 84.9 ±9.9% to 11.0 ±9.4% (p < 0.001). In-hospital, 1 major (0.3%) and 3 minor (1.34%) ischemic strokes occurred, with 2 (0.7%) deaths due to cerebral hemorrhage. Three additional minor strokes occurred within 30 days. The 30-day complication rate was 3.0%. The 4-year follow-up showed 82% overall survival and 89% stroke-free survival. Seven patients (2.3%) developed >50% in-stent restenosis. \n\nInterpretation: CAS using the Roadsaver stent for symptomatic and high-risk lesions is safe and effective, with a low complication rate and acceptable in-stent restenosis risk over 4 years. The study highlights the importance of neuroprotection systems in reducing complications and supports the use of the Roadsaver stent in high-risk patients. Further research is needed to confirm these findings in a randomized controlled trial setting.",
