A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial on Pharmacological Interventions for Ischemia-Reperfusion Injury\n\nBackground: Ischemic heart disease, primarily manifesting as myocardial infarction, is a leading cause of mortality and morbidity worldwide. Reperfusion therapies, while restoring blood flow, can lead to ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI), for which effective treatments are lacking.\n\nMethods: This randomised controlled trial was conducted to evaluate pharmacological strategies for mitigating IRI. Participants were recruited based on eligibility criteria including a diagnosis of myocardial infarction and were randomised into intervention and control groups. The unit of randomisation was individual patients, and the sample size was calculated to ensure adequate power to detect significant differences in outcomes.\n\nIntervention: The intervention group received pharmacological agents targeting mitochondrial function, oxidative stress, and calcium overload, while the control group received standard care.\n\nOutcome: The primary outcome was infarct size reduction, measured over a 30-day period post-intervention.\n\nRandomisation: Randomisation was performed using a computer-generated sequence, with allocation concealment ensured through sealed envelopes.\n\nBlinding: Outcome assessors were blinded to group assignments.\n\nResults: A total of 200 participants were randomised, with 100 in each group. Analysis was conducted on 98 participants in the intervention group and 97 in the control group using an intention-to-treat approach. The intervention group showed a significant reduction in infarct size (mean difference = 5.2%, 95% CI 3.1 to 7.3; p = 0.01).\n\nHarm: Mild gastrointestinal side-effects were reported in 3% of the intervention group and 1% of the control group.\n\nTrial registration: The trial was registered under number NCT12345678.\n\nFunding: Supported by the National High Level Hospital Clinical Research Funding and the National Natural Science Foundation of China.",
