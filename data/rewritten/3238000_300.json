Patients were allocated to receive either MB (n=252) or FB (n=255) devices using a computer-generated randomisation method with concealed allocation. Patients were blinded to treatment allocation. The primary outcome was the change in WOMAC Index scores over 24 months. Secondary outcomes included SF-12 Health Survey, knee range of motion, and Knee Society scores. Device failures and complications were monitored until October 2009. Twelve retrieved MB devices underwent pathologic analysis.\n\nResults: No significant differences were found in mean clinical assessment scores or changes from baseline at any postoperative interval through 2 years. Revision was required in 19/252 MB and 13/255 FB knees. Estimated 6-year survival was 90.1% (95% CI, 84.1–93.9) for MB and 94.2% (95% CI, 90.1–96.6) for FB. Two MB tibial components were revised for loosening, and one MB insert dislocation occurred. Retrieved MB devices showed no unexpected wear or mechanical failures.\n\nInterpretation: MB TKA did not demonstrate functional advantages over FB TKA. Survivorship was similar, although the study's follow-up duration was limited. The trial was registered under NCT00946075. Funding details were not specified. This study provides Level I evidence for the comparative effectiveness of MB and FB TKA designs.",
