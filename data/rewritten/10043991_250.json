A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Intraoperative Mechanical Ventilation Strategies\n\nBackground: This study aimed to evaluate the effects of different intraoperative mechanical ventilation strategies on perioperative lung injury and surgical outcomes.\n\nMethods: A randomised controlled trial was conducted with patients undergoing major abdominal surgery. Participants were randomly assigned to receive either a lung protective ventilation strategy with low tidal volumes (6-8 mL/kg) and PEEP of 5-10 cm H2O or a traditional ventilation strategy with higher tidal volumes (10-12 mL/kg) and zero PEEP. The primary outcome was the incidence of postoperative pulmonary complications, measured within 5 days post-surgery. Randomisation was computer-generated, and allocation was concealed using sealed envelopes. Blinding was applied to outcome assessors.\n\nResults: A total of 200 participants were randomised: 100 to the lung protective group and 100 to the traditional group. Analysis was conducted on 98 participants in the lung protective group and 97 in the traditional group using an intention-to-treat approach. The lung protective group showed a significant reduction in postoperative pulmonary complications (mean difference = 5.2%, 95% CI 3.1 to 7.3; p = 0.01). Adverse events were reported in 3% of the lung protective group and 1% of the traditional group.\n\nInterpretation: Lung protective ventilation strategies significantly reduce postoperative pulmonary complications compared to traditional strategies. \n\nTrial registration: NCT12345678.\n\nFunding: This trial was funded by the National Institutes of Health.",
