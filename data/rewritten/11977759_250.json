  "abstract": "Title: Randomised Controlled Trial of Preoperative Lugol Solution in Total Thyroidectomy for Graves’ Disease\n\nBackground: This randomised controlled trial aimed to evaluate the effects of preoperative Lugol solution on thyroid vascularization and surgical morbidity in patients with Graves’ disease undergoing total thyroidectomy.\n\nMethods: In this single-centre, single-blinded trial, 56 patients undergoing total thyroidectomy for Graves’ disease at Padua University Hospital, Italy, between February 2020 and April 2023, were randomly assigned to receive 7 days of Lugol treatment (Lugol+ group, 29) or no Lugol treatment (Lugol− group, 27). The primary outcome was intraoperative and postoperative blood loss, measured directly and indirectly. Secondary outcomes included duration of surgery, thyroid function, morbidity, vascularization, and microvessel density. Randomisation was performed using Sealed Envelope TM software, with allocation concealment ensured. Outcome assessors and clinicians were blinded, but patients were not. A per-protocol analysis was conducted.\n\nResults: At T1, free tri-iodothyronine (FT3) and free thyroxine (FT4) levels were significantly reduced in the Lugol+ group compared to T0, with no such change in the Lugol− group. No significant differences were found between groups for intraoperative/postoperative blood loss (median 80 ml vs 94 ml), duration of surgery (75 min in both groups), or postoperative morbidity. No severe adverse events were reported, though 35 patients experienced a metallic taste, and 15 had difficulties obtaining the solution.\n\nInterpretation: Preoperative Lugol solution reduces FT3 and FT4 levels but does not affect blood loss, thyroid vascularization, or surgical morbidity.
