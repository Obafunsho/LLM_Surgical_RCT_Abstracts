This study investigates whether continuous monitoring of vital signs improves patient outcomes compared to usual care.\n\nMethods: We conducted a meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) involving non-critical care patients. Participants were randomised to receive either continuous monitoring of vital signs or usual care with intermittent measurements. The primary outcome was hospital mortality, measured during the hospital stay. Secondary outcomes included major events/complications, HDU/ICU admissions, and length of stay. We searched Medline, Embase, and Web of Science, assessing risk of bias using the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool. Randomisation and allocation concealment methods varied across studies, and blinding was not consistently reported.\n\nResults: Seven RCTs with 1284 participants were included. Of these, 664 were randomised to continuous monitoring and 620 to usual care. No statistically significant differences were found in hospital mortality (OR 0.95, 95% CI 0.59–1.53, p = 0.84), major events/complications (OR 0.71, 95% CI 0.38–1.31, p = 0.27), HDU/ICU admissions (OR 0.82, 95% CI 0.25–2.67, p = 0.74), or length of stay (mean difference = -2.12 days, 95% CI -5.56 to 1.32, p = 0.23). Adverse events were not consistently reported.\n\nInterpretation: Continuous monitoring did not significantly improve outcomes compared to usual care. Further research is needed to explore the impact of different monitoring modalities and the role of telepresence services.\n\nTrial registration: PROSPERO CRD42023458656.\n\nFunding: Not specified.",
