The intervention involved 30 intramuscular injections into the index leg on days 0 and 60. The primary outcome was AFS, measured from randomisation to major amputation or death, over 12-36 months. Randomisation was conducted using permuted blocks, and allocation was concealed via an interactive web-based system. Patients, clinicians, and outcome assessors were blinded.\n\nResults: Between September 2017 and November 2020, 143 patients were randomised to PLX-PAD and 70 to placebo. Analysis was conducted on 205 patients using an intention-to-treat approach. The probability of major amputation or death was similar between groups (HR 0.93, 95% CI 0.53 to 1.63; P = 0.788). Adverse events were reported in 73.5% of PLX-PAD and 82.6% of placebo patients, primarily expected events like skin ulcer and gangrene. A post hoc analysis showed improved 12-month AFS in patients with HbA1c <6.5% (HR 0.46, 0.21 to 0.99; P = 0.048).\n\nInterpretation: PLX-PAD did not improve AFS in the overall population but showed potential benefit in patients with well-controlled diabetes, warranting further investigation.
