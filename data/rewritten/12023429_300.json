This study investigates the association between SHR and prognosis in coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) patients.\n\nMethods: This prospective cohort study included 18,307 patients undergoing isolated CABG at the National Center for Cardiovascular Diseases, Fuwai Hospital, Beijing, from January 2013 to December 2021. Participants were categorized into three groups based on SHR tertiles. The primary outcome was a composite of in-hospital death, myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular accident, and reoperation. Long-term outcomes included major adverse cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events (MACCEs). SHR was analyzed using restricted cubic spline and logistic regression for perioperative risks, and Kaplan–Meier and Cox regression for long-term prognosis.\n\nResults: A U-shaped association was observed between SHR and perioperative outcomes (P for nonlinear < 0.001), with an inflection point at 0.79. SHR improved predictive performance for perioperative outcomes (AUC: 0.720 to 0.752, P < 0.001). Long-term MACCE risk increased with higher SHR levels. The third tertile showed a 10.7% greater risk of MACCEs (HR: 1.107, 95% CI 1.023–1.231, P = 0.024). The association was modulated by glucose metabolic status, with a J-shaped pattern in prediabetes and attenuation in diabetes when SHR exceeded 0.76.\n\nInterpretation: SHR is significantly associated with prognosis in CABG patients, showing a U-shaped relationship with short-term outcomes and a linear positive association with long-term outcomes. The in-hospital risk associated with SHR was attenuated in patients with diabetes. These findings support the incorporation of SHR for risk stratification and personalized glucose management in CABG patients.\n\nTrial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02400125\n\nFunding: Not specified.",
