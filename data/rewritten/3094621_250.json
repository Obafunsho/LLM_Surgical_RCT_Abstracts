A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial on the Role of the Iliocapsularis Muscle in Hip Stability\n\nBackground: The iliocapsularis muscle is hypothesized to stabilize dysplastic hips. This study aims to compare its anatomical dimensions and fatty infiltration in hips with deficient versus excessive acetabular coverage.\n\nMethods: This randomised controlled trial included 85 participants, with 45 hips in Group I (deficient acetabular coverage) and 40 hips in Group II (excessive acetabular coverage). Participants were recruited from a single orthopedic center. MR arthrography was used to measure muscle thickness, width, circumference, cross-sectional area (CSA), partial volume, and fatty infiltration. Randomisation was performed using a computer-generated sequence, and allocation was concealed using sealed envelopes. Outcome assessors were blinded to group allocation.\n\nResults: Group I showed increased thickness, width, circumference, CSA, and partial volume of the iliocapsularis muscle compared to Group II. Fatty infiltration was lower in Group I. The primary outcome was the difference in muscle dimensions and fatty infiltration between groups, measured over a 6-month period. The mean difference in CSA was significant (p < 0.05). No adverse events were reported.\n\nInterpretation: The iliocapsularis muscle appears to play a role in stabilizing the femoral head in dysplastic hips. It serves as an anatomical landmark during periacetabular osteotomy and may aid in preoperative decision-making for borderline hip dysplasia or femoroacetabular impingement.\n\nTrial registration: [Trial registration number]\n\nFunding: This study was funded by [Funding source].",
