A 250-word version\n\nTitle: High-Dose Selenium in Cardiac Surgery: A Randomised Controlled Trial\n\nBackground: Selenium, an essential trace element, may improve outcomes in cardiac surgery patients at high risk of organ dysfunction through its antioxidative and anti-inflammatory properties.\n\nMethods: This multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was conducted at 23 sites in Germany and Canada from January 2015 to January 2021. Adult cardiac surgery patients with a EuroSCORE II predicted mortality of 5% or more were randomized 1:1 to receive either high-dose intravenous selenium (2000 μg/L sodium selenite) or placebo. The primary outcome was the number of days alive and free from organ dysfunction within 30 days post-surgery. Randomization was web-based, stratified by site, and allocation was concealed. Patients, clinicians, and outcome assessors were blinded. A total of 1416 patients were randomized, with 697 in each group, and 1394 were analyzed using an intention-to-treat approach.\n\nResults: The median number of persistent organ dysfunction-free days was 29 in both groups (P = 0.45). The 30-day mortality rate was 4.2% in the selenium group and 5.0% in the placebo group (odds ratio, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.50-1.36; P = 0.44). Adverse events were similar between groups.\n\nInterpretation: High-dose selenium did not reduce morbidity or mortality in high-risk cardiac surgery patients. Routine perioperative selenium use is not supported by these findings.\n\nTrial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02002247\n\nFunding: The trial was funded by [source not specified in the manuscript].",
