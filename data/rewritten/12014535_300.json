A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Individualized End-Inspiratory Pause in Prone Spinal Surgery: A Randomized Controlled Trial\n\nBackground: The prone position in spinal surgery can lead to decreased lung compliance and increased airway pressure. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of individualized end-inspiratory pause (EIP) guided by driving pressure on respiratory mechanics in patients undergoing prone spinal surgery.\n\nMethods: A randomized controlled trial was conducted from August to October 2023 at a single hospital. Patients scheduled for elective prone spinal surgery were randomly assigned to either a study group, receiving individualized EIP, or a control group, receiving a fixed EIP (10% of total inspiratory time). The primary outcome was respiratory system compliance (C_RS) measured intraoperatively. Randomization was computer-generated, and allocation was concealed in sealed envelopes. Outcome assessors, data collectors, and patients were blinded to group allocation.\n\nResults: Thirty-eight patients were randomized, with 18 in each group analyzed using an intention-to-treat approach. The study group exhibited a significant increase in C_RS (mean difference = 6 mL·cmH2O−1, p < 0.05) and improved intraoperative oxygenation compared to the control group. Additionally, the individualized EIP significantly decreased plateau pressure and driving pressure (p < 0.05). No postoperative pulmonary complications were observed in either group within three days after surgery.\n\nInterpretation: Individualized EIP guided by driving pressure effectively optimized pulmonary compliance and improved oxygenation during prone spinal surgery. This ventilation strategy may enhance respiratory mechanics and reduce the risk of postoperative pulmonary complications. The findings suggest that individualized EIP could be a beneficial approach in managing respiratory mechanics during prone spinal surgery.\n\nTrial registration: ChiCTR2300074398\n\nFunding: Not specified.",
