A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Fixation Methods for Femoral Neck Fractures\n\nBackground: This study is a secondary analysis of the FAITH trial, an international, multicenter, randomised controlled trial comparing sliding hip screws with cannulated screws for femoral neck fractures in patients aged ≥50 years.\n\nMethods: Participants with Garden-I or II femoral neck fractures and adequate preoperative lateral radiographs were included. Posterior tilt was categorized as <20° or ≥20°. The primary outcome was subsequent arthroplasty within 24 months. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards analysis assessed the association between posterior tilt and arthroplasty, controlling for confounders.\n\nResults: Of 555 patients, 67 (12.1%) had posterior tilt ≥20°, and 488 (87.9%) had tilt <20°. Overall, 73 (13.2%) underwent arthroplasty within 24 months. Patients with tilt ≥20° had a higher risk of arthroplasty (22.4% vs. 11.9%; hazard ratio, 2.22; 95% CI, 1.24 to 4.00; p = 0.008). Age ≥80 years was also associated with increased arthroplasty risk (p = 0.03).\n\nInterpretation: Posterior tilt ≥20° in Garden-I and II femoral neck fractures is associated with increased arthroplasty risk. Primary arthroplasty may be considered for these fractures, especially in older patients.",
