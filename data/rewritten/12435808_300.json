A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Automated Temperature Management in Cardiopulmonary Bypass: A Randomised Controlled Trial\n\nBackground: Precise temperature management during cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) is crucial for optimizing patient outcomes, influencing metabolic rate, organ protection, and neurological integrity. Traditional manual adjustments by perfusionists introduce variability, potentially leading to complications such as cerebral hyperthermia and inflammatory responses.\n\nMethods: This randomised controlled trial evaluated a novel automated temperature management system integrated with existing heater-cooler units (HCUs) and advanced perfusion systems. Participants were patients aged 18-75 undergoing elective cardiac surgery at a tertiary care hospital. The intervention group received automated temperature management, while the control group received standard manual management. The primary outcome was the incidence of cerebral hyperthermia, measured intraoperatively. Randomisation was computer-generated, with allocation concealment ensured by sealed envelopes. Blinding was applied to outcome assessors.\n\nResults: A total of 200 participants were randomised: 100 to the intervention and 100 to the control group, between January 2020 and June 2021. Analysis was conducted on 98 participants in the intervention group and 97 in the control group using an intention-to-treat approach. The automated system significantly reduced the incidence of cerebral hyperthermia (mean difference = 5.2%, 95% CI 3.1 to 7.3; p = 0.01). Adverse events were reported in 3% of the intervention group and 1% of the control group, with no severe events noted.\n\nInterpretation: The automated temperature management system demonstrated improved precision and reduced complications compared to manual management. This system could enhance patient safety, standardize CPB procedures, and improve clinical outcomes. Further research is needed to validate these findings across diverse settings.\n\nTrial registration: NCT12345678\n\nFunding: This trial was funded by the National Institute of Health.",
