This study investigates whether circumferential patellar cauterization reduces anterior knee pain and enhances functional outcomes.\n\nMethods: This prospective, quasi-randomized trial included 78 patients (156 knees) undergoing bilateral, simultaneous TKA without patellar resurfacing. Each patient served as their own control, with patellar cauterization performed on the right knee. The primary outcome was the Kujala score for anterior knee pain, measured preoperatively and at 1 month and 2 years postoperatively. Randomization was based on laterality, and no blinding was applied. The study was conducted in a single surgical center, with a single surgeon performing all procedures.\n\nResults: At the 2-year follow-up, no significant difference was observed in the Kujala score between cauterized and non-cauterized knees (mean difference 0.3; 95% CI, -0.599 to 1.202; p = 0.509). Secondary outcomes, including VAS pain score, Oxford knee score, and Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score, showed no significant differences between groups. Complication rates were low and similar, with one deep venous thromboembolism in the cauterized group and two in the control group (odds ratio 0.49, 95% CI, 0.04-5.56; p = 0.57).\n\nInterpretation: Circumferential patellar cauterization does not provide benefits in reducing anterior knee pain or improving functional outcomes in non-resurfaced TKA. The procedure is not recommended. Trial registration and funding information were not disclosed. The study highlights the need for further research to identify effective interventions for anterior knee pain post-TKA.",
