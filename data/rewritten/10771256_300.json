The primary outcome was the frequency of cellulitis over a 6-month period. Secondary outcomes included assessments of limb circumference, hardness, and pain. Randomisation was conducted using a blocked random assignment with allocation concealment managed by the Clinical Trial Office. Due to the nature of the interventions, blinding was not feasible.\n\nResults: A total of 336 patients were randomised: 105 to the LVA group and 120 to the control group, between January 2017 and September 2019. In the full-analysis set, LVA with decongestive therapy significantly reduced cellulitis frequency compared to decongestive therapy alone (mean difference = −0.35, 95% CI −0.62 to −0.09; p = 0.010). In the per-protocol set, the difference was −0.60 (95% CI −0.94 to −0.27; p = 0.001). Limb circumference and pain did not differ significantly between groups, but LVA reduced thigh area hardness. Four patients in the control group experienced contact dermatitis, which was mild and resolved with treatment.\n\nInterpretation: LVA combined with decongestive therapy is more effective than decongestive therapy alone in preventing cellulitis in patients with lower extremity lymphoedema. The findings suggest that LVA should be considered for patients with recurrent cellulitis despite decongestive therapy.\n\nTrial registration: UMIN00025137, UMIN00031462.\n\nFunding: Not specified.",
