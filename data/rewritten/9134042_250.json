This study aims to compare outcomes between participants in the CODA randomised controlled trial (RCT) and a parallel cohort study of participants who self-selected treatment.\n\nMethods: The CODA trial was a multicenter RCT conducted in 25 US medical centers, enrolling participants from May 3, 2016, to February 5, 2020. Eligible adults with appendicitis were randomised to receive either appendectomy or antibiotics. A parallel cohort included patients who declined randomisation and self-selected treatment. The primary outcome was the rate of appendectomy within 30 days, with all participants followed for at least one year. Randomisation was conducted using a computer-generated sequence, and allocation was concealed. Blinding was not applicable.\n\nResults: A total of 1094 participants were randomised (appendectomy: 547, antibiotics: 547), and 510 were in the self-selection cohort (appendectomy: 253, antibiotics: 257). The rate of appendectomy by 30 days was 15.3% in the self-selection antibiotics group and 19.2% in the randomised antibiotics group (difference, 3.9%; 95% CI, −1.7% to 9.5%). No significant differences in adverse events were reported between groups.\n\nInterpretation: The outcomes were substantially similar between the randomised and self-selection cohorts, suggesting the generalisability of the RCT results.
