A 250-word version\n\nTitle: CETUPANC Trial: A Randomised Controlled Trial Comparing Surgical Approaches in Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma\n\nBackground: This randomised controlled trial aimed to compare the no-touch (NT) approach and the superior mesenteric artery (SMA) approach in pancreatoduodenectomy regarding intraoperative circulating tumour cells (CTCs) and cluster mobilization, and their association with distant metastasis.\n\nMethods: Conducted at ten university hospitals, patients with resectable pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) were randomly assigned to either the NT or SMA group. The primary outcome was intraoperative CTC and cluster mobilization, measured at four time points. Randomization was performed intraoperatively, with allocation concealed until surgery. Patients were blinded to the intervention. A total of 101 patients were randomized (51 SMA, 50 NT) between January 2017 and December 2019. Sixty-three patients with PDAC were analyzed using an intention-to-treat approach.\n\nResults: CTC and cluster mobilization were similar between groups. Median metastasis disease-free survival (MDFS) was 12 months (IQR 6.1–not reached) in the SMA group and 18 months (IQR 12.1–not reached) in the NT group (P = 0.730). High intraoperative cluster dissemination was associated with early metastases within the first year (P = 0.023). The SMA approach (P = 0.025) and vein resection (P < 0.001) were predictive of cluster mobilization. No adverse events were reported.\n\nInterpretation: Both surgical approaches showed similar CTC and cluster mobilization and survival outcomes. High intraoperative cluster dissemination predicted early metastases in PDAC patients.\n\nTrial registration: NCT03340844. Funding: Not specified.",
