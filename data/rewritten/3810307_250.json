A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Surgical Ventricular Reconstruction in Ischemic Heart Failure\n\nBackground: This study evaluates the impact of postoperative reduction in end-systolic volume on survival in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) alone versus CABG plus surgical ventricular reconstruction (SVR).\n\nMethods: In this randomised controlled trial, 1000 patients with ischemic heart failure were randomised to receive either CABG alone or CABG plus SVR. The primary outcome was survival, measured at 4 months postoperatively. Randomisation was performed using a computer-generated sequence, and allocation was concealed. Blinding was not applicable due to the nature of the interventions. Of the 1000 patients, 555 underwent surgery and had paired imaging assessments at baseline and 4 months. The analysis was conducted per-protocol.\n\nResults: SVR improved survival compared to CABG alone when the postoperative end-systolic volume index was ≤70 mL/m². Conversely, patients with a postoperative volume index >70 mL/m² had better outcomes with CABG alone. A reduction in the end-systolic volume index of ≥30% was rare in both groups and did not yield a significant survival benefit with SVR. No significant adverse events were reported.\n\nInterpretation: SVR offers a survival advantage over CABG alone when achieving a postoperative end-systolic volume index of ≤70 mL/m². Extensive ventricular remodeling at baseline may limit the effectiveness of SVR. Trial registration: [Trial registration number]. Funding: [Source of funding].",
