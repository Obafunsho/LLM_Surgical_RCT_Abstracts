A 300-word version\n\nBackground: This study aimed to evaluate a non-contrast imaging method for assessing spatial lung volume displacement and its changes with non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) in healthy volunteers.\n\nMethods: This randomised controlled trial was conducted with nine healthy volunteers (6 males, 3 females; ages 29–55 years; BMI 20.2–31.3 kg/m²) in a clinical research setting. Participants were assessed using X-ray velocimetry (XV) during tidal breathing and NIPPV with 15 cm H₂O inspiratory and 5 cm H₂O expiratory pressures in a supine position. The primary outcome was regional specific ventilation (SV) measured during tidal breathing and NIPPV. Mean specific ventilation (MSV), low volume region (LVR), and high-volume region (HVR) were calculated. Randomisation and allocation concealment methods were not specified. Blinding details were not provided. The sample size calculation was not described.\n\nResults: NIPPV increased MSV in both peripheral (p=0.01) and central (p=0.02) lung regions compared to tidal breathing. High volume regions increased in both peripheral (p=0.04) and central regions (p=0.04) during NIPPV. The analysis approach was not specified. No adverse events were reported. The number of participants analysed in each group was not specified.\n\nInterpretation: The study demonstrates that non-contrast imaging techniques can effectively assess regional lung ventilation and redistribution of lung volumes during NIPPV. The heterogeneous responses to NIPPV suggest potential for further research into differential responses due to lung pathology in respiratory disease. Further studies with larger sample sizes and detailed randomisation and blinding protocols are needed to validate these findings.\n\nTrial registration: Not provided.\n\nFunding: Not specified.",
