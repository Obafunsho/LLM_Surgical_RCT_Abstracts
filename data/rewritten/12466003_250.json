This study evaluates the efficacy of bilateral superficial cervical plexus block (BSCPB) with and without adjuncts in reducing postoperative pain.\n\nMethods: A systematic search of PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane Library, and Embase identified randomized controlled trials and observational studies on BSCPB in thyroid and parathyroid surgeries. The primary outcome was postoperative pain reduction, measured by Visual Analog Scale scores at 6–24 hours post-surgery. Randomization and allocation concealment methods were not specified. Blinding details were not provided. A total of 1507 patients were included, with 753 in the BSCPB group. The analysis was conducted using a random-effects model.\n\nResults: BSCPB significantly reduced postoperative pain compared to control (pooled risk ratio = 0.390, 95% CI: 0.303–0.501, p<0.05). The addition of adjuncts like dexmedetomidine or ropivacaine provided modest further pain relief. Adverse events were not reported.\n\nInterpretation: BSCPB is an effective opioid-sparing strategy for managing postoperative pain in thyroid and parathyroid surgeries. The use of adjuncts offers additional benefits. Trial registration: PROSPERO CRD420251039306. Funding sources were not disclosed.",
