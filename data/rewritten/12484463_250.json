A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Liposomal Bupivacaine vs. Plain Bupivacaine with Dexamethasone for Postoperative Analgesia in VATS\n\nBackground: Effective postoperative analgesia is crucial for recovery after video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS). This trial evaluated whether liposomal bupivacaine provides non-inferior analgesia compared to plain bupivacaine with dexamethasone via rhomboid intercostal block (RIB).\n\nMethods: In this double-blind, randomised controlled trial, 90 VATS patients were randomised to receive either 93 mg liposomal bupivacaine with 25 mg plain bupivacaine or 105 mg plain bupivacaine with 5 mg dexamethasone. The primary outcome was the area under the curve (AUC) of the 48-hour resting pain numeric rating scale (NRS). Randomisation was computer-generated with allocation concealment, and both patients and clinicians were blinded.\n\nResults: Liposomal bupivacaine was non-inferior to plain bupivacaine with dexamethasone, with a 48-hour NRS AUC of 105.5 ± 13.6 vs. 113.1 ± 16.3 (mean difference -7.6; 95% CI -13.9 to -1.2). Opioid use and dermatomal spread were similar within the first 24 hours. Liposomal bupivacaine showed reduced opioid requirement (p = 0.016) and superior Quality of Recovery-15 scores on postoperative day 2 (p < 0.001). Safety profiles were comparable.\n\nInterpretation: RIB with liposomal bupivacaine provides similar analgesia to plain bupivacaine with dexamethasone for VATS postoperative pain.\n\nTrial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT06392191\n\nFunding: Not specified.",
