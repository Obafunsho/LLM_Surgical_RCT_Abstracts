A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Carbon Nanotubes in Cancer Treatment\n\nBackground: Pancreatic, liver, gastric, colorectal, and rectal cancers (PC, LC, GC, CRC, and RC) are highly lethal, with poor prognoses due to late diagnosis and limited treatment efficacy. Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have shown potential in enhancing cancer treatment and diagnosis.\n\nMethods: This randomised controlled trial aimed to evaluate the efficacy of CNTs in cancer treatment. Participants were patients diagnosed with PC, LC, GC, CRC, or RC, recruited from a clinical setting. Eligibility criteria included confirmed diagnosis and consent to participate. Participants were randomly assigned to receive either CNT-based treatment or standard care. Randomisation was performed using a computer-generated sequence, and allocation was concealed using sealed envelopes. Blinding was applied to outcome assessors, patients, and clinicians.\n\nObjective: To assess the effectiveness of CNTs in improving treatment outcomes for PC, LC, GC, CRC, and RC.\n\nOutcome: The primary outcome was the improvement in survival rate over a 5-year period.\n\nResults: A total of 200 participants were randomised, with 100 in the CNT group and 100 in the control group, recruited between January 2020 and June 2021. Analysis was conducted on 98 participants in the CNT group and 97 in the control group using an intention-to-treat approach. The CNT group showed a significant improvement in survival rate (mean difference = 5.2%, 95% CI 3.1 to 7.3; p = 0.01). Adverse events were mild, with 3% in the CNT group and 1% in the control group experiencing mild gastrointestinal side-effects.\n\nTrial registration: NCT01773850.\n\nFunding: The trial was funded by [source not specified]. Further research is needed to explore the full potential of CNTs in clinical practice and address toxicological concerns.",
