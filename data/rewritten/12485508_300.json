A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of STS-PROM in Predicting Stroke and Neurocognitive Outcomes Post-TAVR\n\nBackground: This study evaluates whether the Society of Thoracic Surgeons Predicted Risk of Mortality (STS-PROM) predicts stroke and neurocognitive outcomes following transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR).\n\nMethods: Patient-level data were pooled from four prospective trials: DEFLECT III, NeuroTAVR, REFLECT I, and REFLECT II, involving 537 of 603 patients who underwent TAVR. Participants were stratified into low (<4%), intermediate (4-8%), and high (>8%) STS risk groups. All patients received predischarge diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI) and serial cognitive and neurologic assessments. Outcomes were adjudicated by a clinical events committee, and imaging was analyzed by a single core laboratory.\n\nResults: At 30 days, high-risk patients had higher rates of all-cause and cardiovascular mortality, myocardial infarction, acute kidney injury, bleeding, and vascular complications. However, rates of stroke, disabling stroke, DW-MRI measures of brain injury, and cognitive decline were similar across risk categories. The mean STS score among patients with versus without stroke was similar (5.9 vs 5.1; p = 0.19).\n\nInterpretation: The STS score does not predict stroke, cognitive decline, or acute brain injury after TAVR. The findings suggest that stroke risk is independent of surgical mortality risk and affects all patients equally across STS risk strata. This underscores the need for procedure-related preventive measures to mitigate stroke and embolic risk.\n\nTrial registration: DEFLECT III (NCT02070731), NeuroTAVR (NCT02073864), REFLECT I (NCT02536196), REFLECT II (NCT02536196).\n\nFunding: Not specified.",
