A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Long-term Outcomes of Invasive vs. Noninvasive Treatments for Intermittent Claudication: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Randomised Controlled Trials\n\nBackground: Intermittent claudication (IC) significantly impairs mobility and quality of life. This study compares the long-term outcomes of invasive and noninvasive treatments for IC.\n\nMethods: A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) was conducted. The search included PubMed, MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, Embase, and Scopus. Participants were adults with IC. Interventions included invasive treatments (angioplasty, revascularization) and noninvasive treatments (supervised exercise therapy, best medical therapy). The primary outcomes were quality of life (QoL), ankle-brachial pressure index (ABPI), and maximum walking distance (MWD) over 2 to 7 years. Randomisation and allocation concealment methods were not specified. Blinding details were not provided. A total of 1379 patients from 11 RCTs were included.\n\nResults: Invasive treatments significantly improved MWD (pooled MD = 64.94, 95% CI [10.77, 115.12], p = .02) and ABPI (pooled MD = 0.15, 95% CI [0.04, 0.26], p = .006). However, they were associated with a higher rate of complications, including increased amputation risk (pooled OR = 2.46, 95% CI [0.44, 13.94], p = .31). Noninvasive treatments had higher long-term re-intervention rates (pooled OR = 0.56, 95% CI [0.33, 0.97], p = .04).\n\nInterpretation: Both treatment types are effective for IC management. Invasive treatments offer greater improvements in blood flow and walking distance but carry higher complication risks. Further research is needed to assess cost-effectiveness and long-term outcomes.
