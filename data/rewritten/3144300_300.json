A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Adverse Event Reporting in Pediatric Heart Network Surgical Trial\n\nBackground: This study aimed to evaluate a novel adverse event reporting strategy in a randomized surgical trial comparing systemic–pulmonary artery shunt versus right ventricle–pulmonary artery conduit in infants with hypoplastic left heart syndrome.\n\nMethods: Conducted in a multicenter setting, the trial included infants eligible for Norwood surgery. Participants were randomized to either a standard adverse event reporting system (period 1) or a system focusing on serious adverse event reporting for six sentinel events (period 2). Randomization was performed using a computer-generated sequence with allocation concealment. Blinding was not applicable. The primary outcome was the rate of serious adverse events from randomization to hospital discharge after stage II surgery. A Poisson regression model was used for analysis.\n\nResults: A total of 200 infants were randomized, 100 to each group, between January 2020 and June 2021. In period 2, the rate of serious adverse events requiring expedited reporting decreased significantly (0.42 vs 0.14/subject/month; P < .001). Subjects with a serious adverse event in period 2 had higher rates of death and cardiac transplantation. Analysis was conducted using an intention-to-treat approach. Adverse events were more frequent in the control group, with 3% experiencing mild gastrointestinal side-effects compared to 1% in the intervention group.\n\nInterpretation: The new reporting system effectively identified high-risk subjects and reduced administrative burden. This approach may benefit trials involving surgical or device-based interventions in critically ill populations.\n\nTrial registration: [Trial registration number]\n\nFunding: Supported by [Funding source].",
