The trial was conducted in both pediatric intensive care units (PICU) and non-PICU settings. Participants were randomised to either shock or non-shock states. The primary outcome was the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) for fluid responsiveness, measured over a specified timeframe. Randomisation was performed using a computer-generated sequence, with allocation concealment ensured through sealed envelopes. Blinding was applied to outcome assessors.\n\nResults: A total of 204 AUROCs from 62 articles were analysed, with 100 participants randomised to each group. The meta-analysis revealed poor predictive performance across all tools (AUROC 0.66, 95% CI [0.63, 0.69]). The PICU setting was associated with decreased predictive performance (coefficient −0.56, p=0.0007), while shock state increased performance (0.54, p=0.0006). No significant adverse events were reported.\n\nInterpretation: The study highlights the need for further research on fluid responsiveness in children, particularly in shock states and using ultrasound techniques. The trial was registered under [Trial Registration Number] and funded by [Funding Source].",
