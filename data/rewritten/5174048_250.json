A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Imageless Navigation in Total Hip Arthroplasty\n\nBackground: Iliopsoas tendon impingement can cause persistent groin pain post-THA. This study evaluates whether imageless navigation reduces psoas impingement compared to standard techniques.\n\nMethods: In this randomised controlled trial, 135 patients undergoing THA were randomised to surgery with or without imageless navigation. The primary outcome was the anterior protrusion of the cup above the acetabular rim, measured postoperatively on 3-D CT by a blinded external institute. Randomisation was computer-generated, and allocation was concealed. Blinding was applied to outcome assessors. The study was conducted at a single orthopedic center.\n\nResults: No significant difference was found between the navigated and control groups in mean distance of the cup below the anterosuperior acetabular rim (3.9 mm vs. 4.4 mm; p = 0.72) or anteroinferior rim (4.7 mm vs. 4.2 mm; p = 0.29). The proportion of cups with anterior overhang was similar (7% vs. 15%; p = 0.16). Cup anteversion and female sex were associated with potential psoas impingement. Clinical scores showed no differences between groups with and without anterior cup protrusion.\n\nInterpretation: Imageless navigation did not significantly reduce potential psoas impingement compared to standard techniques. Surgeons should be aware of the increased risk in women. No adverse events were reported. The trial was registered under [Trial Registration Number]. Funding was provided by [Funding Source].",
