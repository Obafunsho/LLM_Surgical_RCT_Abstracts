A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Intranasal Esketamine and Dexmedetomidine for Sedation in Toddlers\n\nBackground: This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of different doses of intranasal esketamine combined with dexmedetomidine for sedation in toddlers undergoing transthoracic echocardiography (TTE).\n\nMethods: In this prospective, double-blind, randomised controlled trial, 121 children aged 1-3 years scheduled for TTE at Hunan Children's Hospital were enrolled. Participants were randomly assigned to receive dexmedetomidine 1 mcg.kg−1 combined with esketamine 0.5 mg.kg−1 (group S1), 1 mg.kg−1 (group S2), or 1.5 mg.kg−1 (group S3). The primary outcome was the success rate of sedation, measured within 45 minutes. Randomisation was computer-generated, and allocation was concealed. Blinding included anesthesiologists, sonographers, children, and parents.\n\nResults: Of the 121 children, 40 were analysed in group S1, 41 in group S2, and 40 in group S3. The success rates were 60% in S1, 85.4% in S2, and 87.5% in S3 (p = 0.004). Onset time and total sedation time were significantly longer in S1 compared to S2 and S3 (p = 0.000). No significant differences were observed in wake-up time or adverse effects among the groups. Adverse events were minimal, with one case of upper airway obstruction in S3 and four instances of oxygen desaturation, all resolving without intervention.\n\nInterpretation: Intranasal administration of dexmedetomidine 1 mcg.kg−1 and esketamine 1 mg.kg−1 provides effective sedation with rapid onset and minimal side effects in toddlers undergoing TTE. This combination offers a promising approach for pediatric sedation, balancing efficacy and safety.\n\nTrial registration: ChiCTR2200060976\n\nFunding: Supported by the Scientific Research Fund of the Hunan Medical Association and the Scientific Research Project of the Hunan Provincial Health Commission.",
