This study aims to elucidate the mechanisms of propofol's immunomodulatory activity.\n\nMethods: In this randomised controlled trial, macrophages from Rab5a−/− and WT mice were treated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) in vitro and in vivo. Peripheral blood monocytes from septic patients and healthy volunteers were also analyzed. The primary outcome was the change in membrane TLR4 expression, assessed over 24 hours. Randomisation was computer-generated, and allocation concealment was achieved using sealed envelopes. Outcome assessors were blinded to group assignments.\n\nResults: Propofol significantly reduced membrane TLR4 expression on macrophages in both in vitro and in vivo settings. Rab5a was identified as a key regulator of TLR4 intracellular trafficking, and propofol inhibited Rab5a expression and its interaction with TLR4. In septic patients, elevated Rab5a and TLR4 expression were observed, which were downregulated by propofol treatment. No adverse events were reported during the study.\n\nInterpretation: The study demonstrates that propofol reduces membrane TLR4 expression by targeting Rab5a, providing insights into its immunomodulatory mechanism. Rab5a emerges as a potential therapeutic target for sepsis treatment. These findings suggest that propofol may help restore immune homeostasis in septic patients.\n\nTrial registration: Not provided.\n\nFunding: Not specified.",
