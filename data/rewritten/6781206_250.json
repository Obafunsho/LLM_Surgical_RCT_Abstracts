A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Ultrasound-Guided Greater Occipital Nerve Block with Botulinum Toxin for Chronic Occipital Headache\n\nBackground: This randomised controlled trial evaluated the long-term efficacy of ultrasound-guided greater occipital nerve (GON) block using botulinum toxin in patients with chronic occipital headache.\n\nMethods: Conducted at Hanyang University Guri Hospital, 54 patients aged 18-85 with chronic occipital headache were randomised into two groups: bupivacaine (BUP, n=27) and botulinum toxin (BTX, n=27). The primary outcome was pain reduction measured by the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) over 24 weeks. Secondary outcomes included patient satisfaction and anatomical parameters. Randomisation was performed using a closed-envelope technique, and allocation was concealed. Blinding was maintained for patients, clinicians, and outcome assessors.\n\nResults: The VAS scores at 4, 8, and 24 weeks were significantly lower in the BTX group compared to the BUP group (p<0.05). Patient satisfaction scores were also higher in the BTX group at these time points. No adverse events were reported in either group.\n\nInterpretation: Ultrasound-guided GON block with botulinum toxin is effective for long-term pain reduction and patient satisfaction in chronic occipital headache. The trial was registered under number 20110021167 and funded by Hanyang University Guri Hospital.",
