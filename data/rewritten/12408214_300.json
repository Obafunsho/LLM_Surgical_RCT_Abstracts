This study aims to evaluate the classification, mechanisms, and imaging diagnosis of endoleaks.\n\nMethods: This review discusses five types of endoleaks, each with distinct characteristics and management approaches. Imaging modalities for endoleak detection include computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), ultrasonography, and angiography, each with unique advantages and limitations.\n\nResults: CT remains the gold standard for endoleak detection, but MRI and contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) show promise in specific scenarios. The article details imaging findings for each endoleak type, emphasizing the importance of multimodality imaging for accurate diagnosis. While CT is essential for early postoperative evaluation and reintervention planning, a tailored approach using various imaging techniques may optimize long-term surveillance. The study highlights the need for a multimodal imaging approach to improve the detection and management of endoleaks, potentially enhancing patient outcomes.\n\nInterpretation: Future research should focus on establishing cost-effective, radiation-minimizing protocols for lifelong post-EVAR monitoring. The study underscores the importance of integrating various imaging modalities to enhance the accuracy of endoleak detection and management. By adopting a comprehensive imaging strategy, healthcare providers can better address the challenges associated with endoleaks, ultimately improving patient care and outcomes. The findings suggest that a tailored approach using CT, MRI, and CEUS can optimize long-term surveillance and reduce the risks associated with radiation exposure and contrast use.",
