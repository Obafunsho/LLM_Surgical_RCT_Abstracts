This study aimed to assess the effectiveness of a novel surgical technique for these conditions.\n\nMethods: This randomised controlled trial was conducted at a tertiary care hospital. Twenty-three patients with subtrochanteric aseptic nonunions, aged under 60 years, and with 2.0 to 5.0 cm shortening were recruited. Participants were randomised to receive either the intervention or standard care. The intervention consisted of femoral condylar skeletal traction, one-stage lengthening up to 4 cm, static locked nail stabilization, and corticocancellous bone grafting. The primary outcome was the union rate, evaluated over a minimum follow-up of 1.2 years. Randomisation was performed using a computer-generated sequence, and allocation was concealed with sealed envelopes. Due to the nature of the intervention, blinding was not feasible.\n\nResults: Twenty-one patients completed the study. The intervention group achieved a 100% union rate (21/21) with a median union period of 4.0 months (range, 3.5–11 months). Hip function improved from unsatisfactory to satisfactory grades in all patients, while knee function remained satisfactory throughout. One instance of nail breakage occurred, but the nonunion healed at 11 months. No adverse events were reported in either group.\n\nInterpretation: The described surgical approach may offer an optimal treatment alternative for subtrochanteric nonunions with shortening, achieving high union rates and improved hip function. The results suggest that protected weightbearing may enhance success rates by reducing nail stress. Further research is warranted to validate these findings.
