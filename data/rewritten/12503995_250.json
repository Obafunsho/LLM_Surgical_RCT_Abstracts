A 250-word version\n\nTitle: A Randomised Controlled Trial Comparing Oblique and Brachy Axis Approaches for Continuous Adductor Canal Block in Total Knee Arthroplasty\n\nBackground: Continuous adductor canal block (CACB) is an effective analgesic technique for total knee arthroplasty (TKA). This study compares the oblique approach (OA) and brachy axis approach (BA) for CACB in terms of analgesic efficacy and adverse reactions.\n\nMethods: In this single-center, randomized, parallel-group, double-blind trial, 90 patients undergoing unilateral TKA were randomly assigned to receive ultrasound-guided CACB using either the OA or BA. The primary outcome was the exercise maximum visual analog scale (VAS) score at 72 hours post-surgery. The main safety indicator was the rate of catheter dislocation. Randomization was computer-generated, with allocation concealed in opaque envelopes. Blinding was maintained for patients, clinicians, and outcome assessors.\n\nResults: Ninety participants were randomized: 45 to the OA group and 45 to the BA group. The OA group showed significantly lower exercise VAS scores at 72 hours (p < 0.05) and a reduced incidence of adverse reactions compared to the BA group. No significant difference was observed in catheter placement time or resting VAS scores. Catheter dislocation occurred only in the BA group.\n\nInterpretation: The OA for CACB after TKA provides superior analgesia during movement and reduces adverse reactions without increasing catheterization time.
