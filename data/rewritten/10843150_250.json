This study evaluates the impact of a mental health intervention on healthcare utilization and cost savings.\n\nMethods: This randomized controlled trial involved 171 patients with traumatic injuries, randomized to a mental health intervention (n=85) or enhanced usual care control (n=86). The intervention included case management, psychotropic medication consultation, and psychotherapy. Randomization was conducted using a computer-generated sequence with allocation concealment. Outcome assessors were blinded. The primary outcome was emergency department/inpatient utilization over 5 years. An economic analysis was also performed.\n\nResults: Intervention patients showed significant reductions in utilization compared to controls (F [19,3210] =2.23, P =0.009), with the greatest reductions at 3-6 months (15.5% vs. 26.7%, RR = 0.58, 95% CI 0.34, 1.00) and 12-15 months (16.5% vs. 30.6%, RR = 0.54, 95% CI 0.32, 0.91). No adverse events were reported. The economic analysis indicated potential cost savings.\n\nInterpretation: The mental health intervention significantly reduced healthcare utilization and suggested cost savings, supporting its integration into trauma center protocols.
