Adult kidney transplant recipients were eligible. Participants were randomised to either C0-based monitoring or AUC-based monitoring. Randomisation was computer-generated, and allocation was concealed using sealed envelopes. Blinding was not applied due to the nature of the intervention.\n\nIntervention: The intervention group received AUC-based monitoring, while the control group continued with standard C0-based monitoring.\n\nObjective: To evaluate the efficacy of AUC-based monitoring compared to C0-based monitoring in preventing tacrolimus-related toxicity and improving graft survival.\n\nOutcome: The primary outcome was the incidence of biopsy-proven acute rejection (BPAR) within 12 months post-transplant.\n\nResults: A total of 200 participants were randomised: 100 to the intervention and 100 to the control group. Analysis was conducted on 98 participants in the intervention group and 97 in the control group using an intention-to-treat approach. The intervention group showed a significant reduction in BPAR (mean difference = 5.2%, 95% CI 3.1 to 7.3; p = 0.01). Adverse events were reported in 3% of the intervention group and 1% of the control group.\n\nTrial registration: N/A\n\nFunding: The trial was funded by institutional grants.",
