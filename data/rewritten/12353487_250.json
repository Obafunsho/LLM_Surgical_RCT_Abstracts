A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Perioperative Normoxia vs. Hyperoxia in Cyanotic Neonates Undergoing Cardiopulmonary Bypass\n\nBackground: Exposure to supra-physiologic oxygen levels is linked to oxidative stress and adverse outcomes. This study evaluates the feasibility, safety, and oxidative stress response of perioperative normoxia versus hyperoxia in cyanotic neonates undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass.\n\nMethods: In this randomised controlled trial, 29 neonates with cyanotic congenital heart disease were enrolled at a single tertiary care center. Participants were randomised to either normoxia (PaO2 60–100 mmHg) or hyperoxia (PaO2 200–300 mmHg) during cardiopulmonary bypass. The primary outcome was serum thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) measured at baseline, 2, 6, and 24 hours postoperatively. Randomisation was computer-generated, and allocation was concealed. Blinding was applied to outcome assessors.\n\nResults: Fifteen neonates were randomised to normoxia and 14 to hyperoxia. Mean PaO2 during bypass was 106±27 mmHg in the normoxia group and 256±29 mmHg in the hyperoxia group (p<0.0001). TBARS levels were significantly lower in the normoxia group at all time points (p<0.01). Safety outcomes, including in-hospital mortality and morbidities, were similar between groups. No severe adverse events were reported.\n\nInterpretation: Perioperative normoxia is feasible, safe, and reduces oxidative stress in cyanotic neonates undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass. These findings support further investigation into clinical outcomes and end-organ injury.\n\nTrial registration: [Trial registration number]\n\nFunding: [Source of funding]",
