Quercetin (Quer), a flavonoid with neuroprotective properties, may mitigate these effects. This study aims to evaluate Quer’s efficacy in reducing Rop-induced neurotoxicity.\n\nMethods: This randomised controlled trial was conducted using SH-SY5Y cells. Cell viability and proliferation were assessed using CCK-8 and EdU incorporation assays. Apoptosis and autophagy were evaluated through morphological criteria and markers such as caspase3 cleavage and MDC staining. Western blot and immunofluorescence staining were performed. Molecular docking predicted target proteins, validated at cellular and protein levels.\n\nResults: Quer significantly reduced Rop-induced viability inhibition and apoptosis in SH-SY5Y cells in a dose-dependent manner. Quer reduced Rop-induced cytotoxicity by stimulating autophagy via the AMPK/mTOR pathway, targeting the Pim1 protein.\n\nInterpretation: Quer alleviates Rop-induced neurotoxicity in SH-SY5Y cells by upregulating Pim1 and enhancing autophagy, suggesting potential therapeutic applications for Rop-induced neurotoxicities.",
