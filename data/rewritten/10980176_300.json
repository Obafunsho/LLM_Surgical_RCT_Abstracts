This study aimed to compare patient satisfaction and out-of-pocket costs between aspirin and low-molecular-weight heparin.\n\nMethods: This secondary analysis of the PREVENT CLOT trial was conducted at 21 trauma centers in the U.S. and Canada. Adult patients with operatively treated extremity fractures or pelvic/acetabular fractures were randomly assigned to receive 30 mg of low-molecular-weight heparin twice daily or 81 mg of aspirin twice daily. The primary outcomes were patient satisfaction and out-of-pocket costs, measured 90 days post-randomization. Randomization was 1:1, and allocation was not concealed from patients or clinicians. The trial enrolled 12,211 patients from April 2017 to August 2021. The analysis followed an intention-to-treat approach.\n\nResults: Of the 12,211 patients, 9725 completed the satisfaction question, and 6723 reported out-of-pocket costs. Patients assigned to aspirin had 2.6 times higher odds of satisfaction (OR: 2.59; 95% CI: 2.39 to 2.80; p < 0.001). Aspirin increased the odds of incurring any out-of-pocket costs (OR: 1.51; 95% CI: 1.37 to 1.66; p < 0.001) but reduced the odds of costs ≥$25 (OR: 0.15; 95% CI: 0.12 to 0.18; p < 0.001). No adverse events were reported.\n\nInterpretation: Aspirin improved patient satisfaction and reduced significant out-of-pocket costs, potentially enhancing health equity. The trial was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02984384) and funded by the University of Maryland School of Medicine and METRC. These findings suggest that aspirin is a viable alternative to low-molecular-weight heparin for thromboprophylaxis in orthopaedic trauma, with benefits in patient satisfaction and cost.",
