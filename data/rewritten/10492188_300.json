A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Axillary Lymph Node Dissection Omission in Mastectomy Patients with Sentinel Lymph Node Metastases\n\nBackground: This sub-analysis of the SINODAR-ONE trial investigates the impact of omitting axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) in patients with T1–2 breast cancer (BC) and one to two macrometastatic sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) undergoing mastectomy.\n\nMethods: Conducted across 52 Italian institutions, this multicentre randomised controlled trial included patients with histologically confirmed invasive BC, tumour size ≤5 cm, cN0, and ≤2 metastatic SLNs. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive ALND followed by adjuvant treatment (standard arm) or adjuvant treatment alone (experimental arm). The primary endpoint was overall survival (OS) and the secondary endpoint was recurrence-free survival (RFS), assessed over a median follow-up of 33.0 months. Randomisation was computer-generated, and allocation was concealed. Blinding was not applied.\n\nResults: A total of 218 patients were randomised: 111 to the ALND group and 107 to the SLNB-only group. In the intention-to-treat analysis, the 5-year OS rates were 97.8% in the ALND arm and 98.7% in the SLNB-only arm (P = 0.597). The 5-year RFS rates were 95.7% and 94.1%, respectively (P = 0.821). No axillary lymph node recurrences were observed. Adverse events were not reported. The study was initially planned for 2000 patients but ceased early due to low accrual and fewer events than expected.\n\nInterpretation: Omission of ALND in mastectomy patients with T1–2 BC and one to two macrometastatic SLNs did not result in inferior OS or RFS compared to ALND. These findings support the potential for less invasive axillary management in this patient population. Further enrolment is ongoing to confirm these results.\n\nTrial registration: NCT05160324\n\nFunding: Not specified.",
