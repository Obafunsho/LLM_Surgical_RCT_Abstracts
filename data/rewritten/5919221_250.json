A 250-word version\n\nTitle: A Randomised Controlled Trial of Preoperative Physical Therapy Education for Total Joint Arthroplasty\n\nBackground: This randomised controlled trial evaluated the effect of a one-time, one-on-one preoperative physical therapy education session coupled with a web-based microsite (preopPTEd) on patients’ readiness to discharge from physical therapy (PT), length of hospital stay, and patient-reported functional outcomes after total joint arthroplasty.\n\nMethods: Between February and June 2015, 126 patients undergoing unilateral TKA or THA were randomised into two groups at a single institution. All participants attended a preoperative group education class. The intervention group (n = 63) received preopPTEd, while the control group (n = 63) received no further education. The primary outcome was readiness to discharge from PT, measured by the number of postoperative inpatient PT visits. Randomisation was computer-generated, and allocation was concealed. Outcome assessors were blinded.\n\nResults: The preopPTEd group had fewer postoperative inpatient PT visits (mean, 3.3; 95% CI, 3.0-3.6) and achieved readiness to discharge faster (mean, 1.6 days; 95% CI, 1.2-1.9) than the control group. No significant difference was found in hospital length of stay or 6-week WOMAC scores. No adverse events were reported.\n\nInterpretation: Preoperative PT education improved readiness to discharge from PT but did not affect hospital length of stay or WOMAC scores. Further research is needed to enhance other aspects of care to reduce hospital stay.\n\nTrial registration: Not provided.\n\nFunding: Not provided.",
