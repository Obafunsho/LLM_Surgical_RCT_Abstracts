This study aimed to investigate the effects of different PEEP levels and ARMs on ventilation distribution, oxygenation, haemodynamic parameters, and cerebral oximetry.\n\nMethods: This substudy of a randomised controlled trial was conducted at a tertiary medical centre in Geneva, Switzerland, from 2015 to 2018. Participants included 162 patients with a BMI of at least 35 kg/m² undergoing elective open or laparoscopic surgery lasting at least 120 minutes. Patients were randomised to receive either PEEP of 4 cmH₂O (n = 79) or PEEP of 12 cmH₂O with hourly ARMs (n = 83). The primary outcome was the fraction of ventilation in the dependent lung, measured by electrical impedance tomography over the intra-operative period. Randomisation was computer-generated, and allocation was concealed. Blinding was not applicable.\n\nResults: High PEEP was associated with smaller decreases in dependent lung ventilation (-11.2%; 95% CI -8.7 to -13.7 vs. -13.9%; 95% CI -11.7 to -16.5; P = 0.029) and a lower driving pressure (-6.3 cmH₂O; 95% CI -5.7 to -7.0). Haemodynamic parameters were similar between groups, except for transient decreases in arterial pressure and cardiac index at the end of ARMs.\n\nInterpretation: In obese patients undergoing abdominal surgery, PEEP of 12 cmH₂O with ARMs slightly improved ventilation distribution and oxygenation compared to PEEP of 4 cmH₂O.\n\nTrial registration: NCT02148692\n\nFunding: Not specified.",
