Participants were stratified by herniation level. The primary outcomes were the Short Form-36 bodily pain and physical functioning scales and the modified Oswestry Disability Index, measured at six weeks, three months, six months, one year, and two years. Randomisation was achieved using a computer-generated sequence, with allocation concealment maintained. Due to the nature of the interventions, blinding was not feasible.\n\nResults: The study analysed 646 L5-S1, 456 L4-L5, and 88 upper lumbar herniations. At two years, patients with upper lumbar herniations experienced a significantly greater treatment effect from surgery compared to those with L5-S1 herniations: 24.6 vs. 7.1 for bodily pain (p = 0.002); 23.4 vs. 9.9 for physical functioning (p = 0.014); and −19 vs. −10.3 for Oswestry Disability Index (p = 0.033). A trend towards greater treatment effect for surgery at L4-L5 compared to L5-S1 was observed, significant only for physical functioning (p = 0.006). Adverse events were not reported.\n\nInterpretation: The benefit of operative treatment varied by herniation level, with the smallest effects at L5-S1 and the largest at L2-L3 and L3-L4. This difference was primarily due to less improvement in nonoperative treatment for upper lumbar herniations.\n\nTrial registration: [Trial registration number]\n\nFunding: [Source of funding]",
