Participants were non-randomly assigned to PFS (57 patients, 90 legs) or CS (148 patients, 236 legs). The primary outcome was the change in Venous Clinical Severity Score (VCSS) and VEINES-QoL/Sym scores, measured preoperatively and 30 days post-treatment. Sample size calculation aimed to detect a 1.5-point difference in VCSS with 80% power and 95% confidence.\n\nResults: Both treatments significantly improved VCSS and VEINES scores (p < 0.05). CS demonstrated greater improvements in VCSS (mean difference = 4.02, 95% CI 3.1 to 5.0; p < 0.001), VEINES-QoL (mean difference = 8, 95% CI 6.5 to 9.5; p < 0.001), and VEINES-Sym (mean difference = 11.66, 95% CI 9.8 to 13.5; p < 0.001) compared to PFS. Postoperative pain and aesthetic concerns were more pronounced in the PFS group. No adverse events were reported in either group.\n\nInterpretation: Both PFS and CS improved quality of life in patients with varicose veins, but CS provided more significant benefits. The study was not randomised, and no blinding was used. Trial registration: Not provided. Funding: Not disclosed. The findings suggest that while both treatments are effective, CS may offer superior outcomes in terms of patient-reported quality of life improvements.",
