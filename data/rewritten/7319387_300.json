A 300-word version\n\nTitle: A Randomised Controlled Trial Comparing Kinematic and Mechanical Alignment in Total Knee Arthroplasty\n\nBackground: This randomised controlled trial evaluated the differences between kinematic and mechanical alignment in total knee arthroplasty (TKA) concerning patient-reported outcomes, survivorship, and radiographic aseptic loosening over five years.\n\nMethods: Ninety-nine primary TKAs for osteoarthritis were randomised to mechanical alignment (n = 50) or kinematic alignment (n = 49) groups. Computer navigation was used for mechanical alignment, and patient-specific cutting blocks for kinematic alignment. The primary outcome was patient-reported outcome measures assessed using the Knee Society Score, VAS, Oxford Knee Score, WOMAC, Forgotten Joint Score, and EuroQol 5D at five years. Randomisation was performed using a computer-generated sequence, and allocation was concealed. Outcome assessors were blinded. The study was conducted at [study setting], and participants met eligibility criteria for primary TKA due to osteoarthritis.\n\nResults: At five years, 95% of mechanical alignment and 96% of kinematic alignment TKAs were available for follow-up. No differences were found in patient-reported outcomes between groups. The mean Oxford Knee Score was similar (kinematic: 41.4 ± 7.2 vs. mechanical: 41.7 ± 6.3; difference -0.3 [95% CI -3.2 to 2.5]; p = 0.99). Survivorship free from reoperation was 92.2% for mechanical and 89.7% for kinematic alignment (p = 0.674). Survivorship free from revision was 94.1% for mechanical and 95.9% for kinematic alignment (p = 0.681). One case of radiographic aseptic loosening was observed in the mechanical alignment group. No significant adverse events were reported.\n\nInterpretation: No mid-term functional or radiographic differences were found between the two alignment techniques. The anticipated improvements with kinematic alignment were not realized. Long-term effects of kinematic alignment require further investigation.\n\nTrial registration: [Trial registration number]\n\nFunding: [Source of funding]",
