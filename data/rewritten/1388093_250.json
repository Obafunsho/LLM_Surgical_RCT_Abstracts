A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Small-Dose Intravenous Ketamine with Continuous Femoral Nerve Block in Total Knee Arthroplasty\n\nBackground: This study evaluated the effect of small-dose intravenous ketamine combined with continuous femoral nerve block on postoperative pain and rehabilitation after total knee arthroplasty.\n\nMethods: In a randomised controlled trial, patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty were randomly assigned to receive either an initial bolus of 0.5 mg/kg ketamine followed by a continuous infusion of 3 μg·kg -1 ·min -1 during surgery and 1.5 μg·kg -1 ·min -1 for 48 h (Ketamine group) or an equal volume of saline (Control group). Continuous femoral nerve block with ropivacaine was administered before surgery and continued for 48 h. Randomisation was performed using a computer-generated sequence with allocation concealment. Patients, clinicians, and outcome assessors were blinded. The primary outcome was morphine consumption over 48 hours.\n\nResults: A total of 200 participants were randomised: 100 to the Ketamine group and 100 to the Control group. The Ketamine group required significantly less morphine than the Control group (45 ± 20 mg versus 69 ± 30 mg; P < 0.02). Patients in the Ketamine group reached 90° of active knee flexion more rapidly (P < 0.02). No significant differences were observed in outcomes at 6 weeks and 3 months. Adverse events were not reported.\n\nInterpretation: Ketamine is a useful analgesic adjuvant in perioperative multimodal analgesia, positively impacting early knee mobilization.
