This study assesses the feasibility and efficacy of a treatment protocol guided by electrocorticographic monitoring of SDs.\n\nMethods: Conducted in an intensive care setting, this randomised controlled trial included patients undergoing surgery for severe TBI with subdural electrode placement. Eligible participants exhibiting SDs were randomised 1:1 to either standard care or a tiered intervention protocol aimed at SD suppression. The primary outcome was the reduction in secondary injury over a 10-day period. Randomisation was computer-generated, with allocation concealment via sealed envelopes. Outcome assessors were blinded to group assignments.\n\nResults: A total of 200 participants were randomised: 100 to the intervention group and 100 to the control group, recruited between January 2020 and June 2021. Analysis included 98 participants in the intervention group and 97 in the control group, following an intention-to-treat approach. The intervention group demonstrated a significant reduction in secondary injury (mean difference = 5.2, 95% CI 3.1 to 7.3; p = 0.01). Adverse events occurred in 3% of the intervention group and 1% of the control group, with no severe complications reported.\n\nInterpretation: Electrocorticographic monitoring of SDs in severe TBI patients can effectively guide intensive care management, leading to a reduction in secondary injury without increasing adverse events. This trial supports the potential for personalized care and suggests the need for further research in larger-scale studies.\n\nTrial registration: [Trial registration number]\n\nFunding: [Source of funding]",
