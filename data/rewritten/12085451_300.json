A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial on Pain Management in Minimally Invasive Cardiac Surgery\n\nBackground: Minimally invasive cardiac surgery (MICS) is associated with reduced tissue trauma and faster recovery compared to conventional sternotomy. However, managing postoperative pain effectively remains a significant challenge.\n\nMethods: This randomised controlled trial aimed to evaluate the efficacy of pain management strategies in MICS. Participants were eligible if they were undergoing MICS and were recruited from a single cardiac surgery center. The intervention group received thoracic epidural analgesia (TEA), while the control group received thoracic paravertebral block (TPVB). The primary outcome was postoperative pain measured on a visual analog scale (VAS) over 48 hours. Randomisation was computer-generated, and allocation was concealed using sealed envelopes. Blinding was applied to outcome assessors, patients, and clinicians.\n\nResults: A total of 200 participants were randomised: 100 to the TEA group and 100 to the TPVB group, between January 2020 and June 2021. Analysis was conducted on 98 participants in the TEA group and 97 in the TPVB group using an intention-to-treat approach. The mean VAS score was significantly lower in the TEA group (mean difference = 1.5, 95% CI 0.8 to 2.2; p < 0.001). Adverse events occurred in 5% of the TEA group and 3% of the TPVB group, with no severe complications reported.\n\nInterpretation: TEA provides superior pain relief compared to TPVB in MICS, with a manageable safety profile. Despite the concerns regarding anticoagulation-related complications and hemodynamic instability, TEA remains an effective option for pain management in MICS. Further studies are needed to confirm these findings and explore long-term outcomes.\n\nTrial registration: NCT12345678\n\nFunding: This trial was funded by the National Institute of Health.",
