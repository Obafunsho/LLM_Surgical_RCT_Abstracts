A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial on Gender Bias and Stereotype Threat in Surgical Training\n\nBackground: Gender imbalance in surgery may be influenced by pro-male bias and stereotype threat. This study evaluates the association between pro-male gender bias and career engagement, and the effect of stereotype threat on skill performance among surgical trainees.\n\nMethods: A double-blind, randomised controlled trial was conducted in three academic general surgery training programs. Participants were 96 general surgery residents with academic career interests, recruited between August 1 and August 15, 2018. In phase 1, surveys assessed the association of gender bias with career engagement. In phase 2, 85 residents were randomised 1:1 using permuted-block design stratified by site, training level, and gender to receive either a stereotype threat trigger or protection. The primary outcome was the Fundamentals of Laparoscopic Surgery (FLS) score, measured immediately post-intervention. Intention-to-treat analysis was conducted. Blinding was maintained for outcome assessors, patients, and clinicians.\n\nResults: Seventy-seven residents completed both phases. Pro-male bias was associated with higher career engagement in men (coefficient, 1.02; 95% CI, 0.19-2.24; P = .04) but not in women. No significant difference in FLS scores was observed between interventions (mean [SD], A: 395 [150] vs B: 367 [157]; P = .51). The response to stereotype threat activation was similar in men and women (interaction coefficient, 15.1; 95% CI, −124.5 to 154.7; P = .39). Higher susceptibility to stereotype threat was linked to lower FLS scores in women receiving the threat trigger (coefficient, −43.4; 95% CI, −48.0 to −38.9; P = .001).\n\nInterpretation: Pro-male bias and stereotype threat may impact career engagement and skill performance among surgical trainees. No adverse events were reported. Trial Registration: NCT03623009. Funding: Not specified.",
