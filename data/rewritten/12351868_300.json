Systematic literature searches were conducted in MEDLINE, PUBMED, Embase, CINAHL, and The Cochrane Library up to December 2020. The Modified GRADE system was used to code the strength of recommendations and the level of supporting evidence.\n\nResults: The guideline emphasizes a shift from the traditional \"fistula first\" approach to a more individualized decision-making process, considering patient preferences and clinical circumstances. Key recommendations include advising fistula formation for suitable patients and catheter access for very small children or short-term haemodialysis. The guideline also addresses complications, central venous stenosis, and the importance of planning and education. It highlights the need for a holistic approach, integrating patient individuality into decision-making processes. The guideline provides a comprehensive framework for vascular access care, promoting informed patient choices and high-quality assessment.\n\nInterpretation: The updated guideline offers a modernized approach to vascular access care, encouraging a patient-centered model that respects individual preferences and clinical needs. It aims to improve the quality of care by providing clear recommendations and supporting evidence, fostering a more informed and collaborative decision-making process.\n\nTrial registration: Not applicable.\n\nFunding: Not specified.",
