A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Adjuvant Interferon Therapy in Hepatitis B-Related Hepatocellular Carcinoma\n\nBackground: Recurrence is common after hepatic resection for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Interferon has antiviral, immunomodulatory, antiproliferative, and antiangiogenic effects, potentially improving prognosis post-resection.\n\nMethods: This randomised controlled trial enrolled patients with no residual disease after hepatic resection for HCC, predominantly hepatitis B-related, from February 1999 to June 2002. Participants were stratified by pTNM stage and randomly assigned to no treatment (control) or interferon alpha-2b 10 MIU/m² thrice weekly for 16 weeks (IFN-I group). Enrollment to a higher dose group was terminated due to adverse effects. Randomisation was conducted using a computer-generated sequence with allocation concealment. Blinding was not applied.\n\nResults: Eighty patients were randomised: 40 to the control group and 40 to the IFN-I group. The primary outcome was overall survival, measured at 1 and 5 years. The 1- and 5-year survival rates were 85% and 61% for the control group, and 97% and 79% for the IFN-I group (P = 0.137). The relative risk of death for interferon treatment was 0.42 (95% CI, 0.17–1.05; P = 0.063). Adverse effects led to treatment discontinuation in the higher dose group.\n\nInterpretation: Adjuvant interferon therapy showed a trend for survival benefit, particularly in patients with pTNM stage III/IVA tumors. Further trials are needed. Trial registration and funding details were not provided.",
