Participants were randomly assigned to receive multiple focused ultrasound exposures using a hemispherical phased array transducer with patient-specific treatment planning. The primary outcome was the ability to achieve controlled and precise thermal ablation in the brain, assessed through MR temperature imaging over a defined timeframe. Randomisation was performed using a computer-generated sequence, and allocation was concealed with sealed envelopes. Due to the nature of the intervention, blinding was not applicable to patients or clinicians.\n\nResults: The trial demonstrated the feasibility of focusing an ultrasound beam transcranially into the brain and visualizing the heating with MR temperature imaging. While limited by the available device power, extrapolation of temperature measurements indicated the potential for thermal ablation without overheating the brain surface. No adverse events were reported during the study period.\n\nInterpretation: These findings mark a significant advancement towards a noninvasive alternative to surgical resection for brain disorders. The results suggest that with enhanced device power, TcMRgFUS could achieve thermal coagulation, warranting further investigation in larger trials.\n\nTrial registration: [Trial registration number]\n\nFunding: This trial was funded by [source of funding].",
