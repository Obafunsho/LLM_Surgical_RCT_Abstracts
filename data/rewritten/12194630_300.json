A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Bariatric and Endoscopic Interventions on MASLD\n\nBackground: This study assesses the impact of various bariatric and endoscopic interventions on metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD).\n\nMethods: A randomised controlled trial was conducted with participants diagnosed with obesity and MASLD, recruited from a tertiary care center. Randomisation was computer-generated, with allocation concealment via sealed envelopes. Outcome assessors were blinded. The primary outcome was the resolution of hepatic steatosis, evaluated over 12 months.\n\nIntervention: Participants were randomised to receive Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB), vertical sleeve gastrectomy (VSG), adjustable gastric banding (AGB), or endoscopic therapies such as intragastric balloon (IGB) and endoscopic sleeve gastroplasty (ESG). The control group underwent standard lifestyle modification.\n\nResults: A total of 200 participants were randomised: 50 to RYGB, 50 to VSG, 50 to AGB, and 50 to endoscopic therapies. Analysis included 48 in RYGB, 47 in VSG, 46 in AGB, and 45 in endoscopic therapies, using an intention-to-treat approach. RYGB achieved the highest resolution of steatosis (95%), followed by VSG (60%), AGB (42%), and endoscopic therapies, which showed notable short-term improvements. The effect size for RYGB was significant (mean difference = 5.2, 95% CI 3.1 to 7.3; p = 0.01). Adverse events were mild, with 3% in RYGB and 1% in VSG experiencing gastrointestinal side effects.\n\nInterpretation: RYGB and VSG offer significant long-term hepatic improvements, while endoscopic therapies provide effective short-term alternatives. These findings suggest that surgical interventions are superior for sustained liver health, but endoscopic options are viable for less invasive treatment. Further research is warranted to validate these results.\n\nTrial registration: NCT12345678\n\nFunding: Supported by the National Institutes of Health.",
