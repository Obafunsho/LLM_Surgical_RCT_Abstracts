This study aimed to compare early postoperative outcomes between these surgical approaches.\n\nMethods: Conducted at the University Hospital Center “Mother Theresa”, Tirana, Albania, this retrospective study included patients who underwent isolated aortic valve replacement from July 17, 2017, to July 30, 2024. Eligible participants were adults requiring only aortic valve surgery, with 115 undergoing standard sternotomy and 53 undergoing mini-sternotomy. The primary outcome was early postoperative recovery, assessed by ICU stay and mechanical ventilation duration. Data were analyzed using an intention-to-treat approach.\n\nResults: The cohort's mean age was 62 ± 12.5 years. The mini-sternotomy group experienced significantly shorter ICU stays (39.92 ± 8.62 hours vs. 55.96 ± 32.56 hours, p < 0.001) and mechanical ventilation durations (5.82 ± 2.44 hours vs. 10.41 ± 14.68 hours, p = 0.030). Overall mortality was 1.2%, with no significant differences between groups. Adverse events were comparable, with no significant differences in perioperative complications.\n\nInterpretation: Mini-sternotomy is as safe as standard sternotomy, providing shorter ICU stays and mechanical ventilation durations, which may translate into reduced hospital costs. The study was approved by the Ethics Council, University of Medicine, Tirana (approval number: 3265/Prot). No trial registration or funding source was reported. The findings support incorporating minimally invasive techniques into surgical strategies for aortic valve surgery, given their safety and efficiency in early postoperative recovery.",
