A 250-word version\n\nTitle: A Randomised Controlled Trial Comparing Retrolaminar Block and Serratus Anterior Plane Block for Postoperative Analgesia in Radical Mastectomy\n\nBackground: The retrolaminar block (RLB) is a novel regional anesthetic technique for radical mastectomy, yet its efficacy compared to the serratus anterior plane block (SAPB) remains underexplored.\n\nMethods: This prospective, randomised controlled trial included 70 patients undergoing radical mastectomy. Participants were randomly assigned to receive either ultrasound-guided RLB or SAPB. The primary outcome was the visual analogue scale (VAS) score during coughing at 6 hours postoperatively. Secondary outcomes included dermatomal spread of sensory block, intraoperative hemodynamic changes, and analgesia-related adverse reactions. Randomisation was performed using a computer-generated sequence, and allocation was concealed. Blinding was applied to outcome assessors.\n\nResults: A total of 35 patients were randomised to each group. The median VAS scores during coughing at 6 hours postoperatively were 2 (IQR: 1-3) in both groups, with no significant difference (P = 0.39). RLB provided broader sensory coverage on the medial side of the nipple compared to SAPB (median [IQR]: 3 [3-4] vs. 2 [1-2], P = 0.006). No significant differences in mean arterial pressure or heart rate were observed. Adverse events were similar between groups.\n\nInterpretation: RLB and SAPB offer comparable postoperative analgesia following radical mastectomy, with RLB providing broader sensory block range.
