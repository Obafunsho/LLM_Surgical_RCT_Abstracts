A 300-word version\n\nTitle: A Randomised Controlled Trial Comparing Oblique and Brachy Axis Approaches for Continuous Adductor Canal Block in Total Knee Arthroplasty\n\nBackground: Continuous adductor canal block (CACB) is a key analgesic technique in total knee arthroplasty (TKA). This study evaluates the oblique approach (OA) versus the brachy axis approach (BA) for CACB, focusing on analgesic outcomes and adverse reactions.\n\nMethods: This single-center, randomized, parallel-group, double-blind trial involved 90 patients undergoing unilateral TKA. Participants were randomly assigned to receive ultrasound-guided CACB using either the OA or BA. The primary outcome was the exercise maximum visual analog scale (VAS) score at 72 hours post-surgery. The main safety indicator was the rate of catheter dislocation. Randomization was computer-generated, with allocation concealed in opaque envelopes. Blinding was maintained for patients, clinicians, and outcome assessors.\n\nResults: Ninety participants were randomized: 45 to the OA group and 45 to the BA group. The OA group demonstrated significantly lower exercise VAS scores at 72 hours (p < 0.05) and a reduced incidence of adverse reactions compared to the BA group. No significant difference was observed in catheter placement time or resting VAS scores. Catheter dislocation occurred only in the BA group. Adverse reactions were more frequent in the BA group, including swelling and pain at the catheter site.\n\nInterpretation: The OA for CACB after TKA offers improved analgesia during movement and reduces adverse reactions without increasing catheterization time. These findings suggest that the OA may enhance postoperative recovery and patient satisfaction. Trial Registration: Chinese Clinical Trial Registry: ChiCTR2200059889. Funding: Not specified.",
