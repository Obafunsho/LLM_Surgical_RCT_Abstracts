A 250-word version\n\nTitle: A Randomised Controlled Trial Comparing General Anesthesia Plus Local Infiltration with Spinal Anesthesia for Hemorrhoidectomy\n\nBackground: Effective anesthesia with minimal complications is crucial for hemorrhoidectomy. This study aimed to compare the effects of general anesthesia plus local infiltration (GAL) versus spinal anesthesia (SA) on postoperative complications and pain.\n\nMethods: This retrospective single-center cohort study was conducted at a tertiary medical center in East Asia. Participants were patients undergoing excisional hemorrhoidectomy between January 1, 2017, and March 31, 2023. Eligibility criteria included patients aged ≥20 years with ASA scores <3. The primary outcome was acute urine retention (AUR) within 24 hours post-surgery. Secondary outcomes included pain, constipation, bleeding, nausea, and headache. A total of 550 patients were included: 220 in the GAL group and 330 in the SA group. Randomization and blinding details were not applicable due to the retrospective design.\n\nResults: The AUR rate was significantly lower in the GAL group compared to the SA group (15.5% vs. 32.1%, P < 0.001). Pain scores ≥4 were similar between groups (36.2% vs. 39.8%, P = 0.429). The GAL group had a lower overall rate of adverse effects (56.9% vs. 67.4%, P = 0.023). No significant differences were observed in other complications or readmission rates.\n\nInterpretation: GAL is associated with a lower incidence of AUR and adverse effects, making it a favorable anesthesia choice for hemorrhoidectomy.
