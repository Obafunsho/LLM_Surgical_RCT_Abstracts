A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of ET-AR Antagonist in Post-Cardiac Surgery Inflammation\n\nBackground: This randomised controlled trial evaluated the impact of an endothelin-A receptor (ET-AR) antagonist on tumor necrosis factor (TNF) activation following cardiac surgery. Preclinical studies indicate interaction between ET-AR and TNF signaling pathways.\n\nMethods: Forty-four patients scheduled for cardiac surgery were randomised to receive a bolus infusion of vehicle or ET-AR antagonist (sitaxsentan) at doses of 0.1, 0.5, 1, or 2 mg/kg upon separation from cardiopulmonary bypass. Plasma levels of TNF-α and soluble TNF receptors 1 and 2 were assessed at baseline and 24 hours post-infusion. Randomisation was computer-generated, with allocation concealment ensured. Blinding was applied to outcome assessors, patients, and clinicians. The primary outcome was the change in TNF-α levels at 24 hours.\n\nResults: At 24 hours, the 1 mg/kg ET-AR antagonist group exhibited reduced plasma levels of TNF-α and TNF receptor 2 compared to the vehicle group (mean difference ~13 pg/mL and ~0.5 ng/mL, respectively; p<0.05). TNF receptor 1 levels decreased by ~1 ng/mL with higher doses and remained lower by ~3 ng/mL at 24 hours (p<0.05). A dose-response relationship was observed (p<0.01). No adverse events were reported.\n\nInterpretation: The ET-AR antagonist effectively modulates TNF receptor activation in the post-cardiac surgery setting, indicating potential therapeutic applications beyond cardiovascular effects. Trial registration: [Trial registration number]. Funding: [Source of funding]. This study highlights the mechanistic link between ET-AR and TNF receptor activation, offering insights into novel post-operative management strategies.",
