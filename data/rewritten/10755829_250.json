A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial on Arrhythmia Management in Tetralogy of Fallot\n\nBackground: Arrhythmias are a common complication in patients with tetralogy of Fallot (ToF), impacting health and quality of life. This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of different arrhythmia management strategies in ToF patients.\n\nMethods: This randomised controlled trial was conducted at a tertiary care center. Participants included ToF patients across various age groups with documented arrhythmias. The unit of randomisation was the individual patient. Sample size calculation was based on detecting a clinically significant difference in arrhythmia control. Participants were randomised to receive either pharmacologic therapy or interventional therapy. Randomisation was computer-generated, and allocation was concealed using sealed envelopes. Blinding was applied to outcome assessors.\n\nResults: A total of 200 participants were randomised: 100 to the pharmacologic group and 100 to the interventional group, between January 2020 and June 2021. Analysis was conducted on 98 participants in the pharmacologic group and 97 in the interventional group using an intention-to-treat approach. The primary outcome was arrhythmia control over a 12-month period. The interventional group showed a significant improvement in arrhythmia control (mean difference = 5.2, 95% CI 3.1 to 7.3; p = 0.01). Adverse events were reported in 3% of the pharmacologic group and 1% of the interventional group.\n\nInterpretation: Interventional therapy was more effective in controlling arrhythmias in ToF patients compared to pharmacologic therapy. Further research is needed to refine these strategies.\n\nTrial registration: NCT12345678\n\nFunding: This trial was funded by the National Institutes of Health.",
