A 250-word version\n\nTitle: A Multicenter, Cluster-Randomized Controlled Trial of a Standardized Smoking Cessation Intervention for Vascular Surgery Patients\n\nBackground: Smoking cessation is crucial for patients undergoing vascular surgery, yet practices vary widely. This study evaluates a standardized smoking cessation intervention compared to usual care.\n\nMethods: This multicenter, cluster-randomized trial involved eight centers, randomized to either a standardized intervention or usual care. The intervention included physician \"very brief advice,\" nicotine replacement therapy (NRT), and referral to a phone-based counseling service. Participants were patients scheduled for vascular surgery or endovascular interventions. The primary outcome was the rate of smoking cessation, measured at 6 months post-intervention. Randomization was conducted at the center level, with allocation concealment ensured. Blinding was not applicable due to the nature of the intervention.\n\nResults: A total of 142 patients were enrolled, with 71 in each group. Patients in the intervention group were more likely to receive physician advice (98% vs. 77%), NRT (77% vs. 13%), and quitline referral (93% vs. 33%) (all p<0.001). Final smoking cessation rates are pending. No adverse events were reported.\n\nInterpretation: The standardized smoking cessation intervention is feasible and increases the delivery of cessation support. Further analysis will determine its impact on smoking cessation rates.\n\nTrial registration: [Trial registration number]\n\nFunding: [Source of funding]",
