ANG-3777, a hepatocyte growth factor mimetic, may enhance outcomes by binding to the c-MET receptor.\n\nMethods: This multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 2 trial included patients with <50 cc/h urine output for 8 consecutive hours or creatinine reduction ratio <30% within 24 hours posttransplantation. Participants were randomized 2:1 to receive ANG-3777 (2 mg/kg, n=19) or placebo (n=9) via three once-daily IV infusions. The primary outcome was time to achieve ≥1200 cc urine output over 24 hours within 28 days. Randomization was computer-generated, and allocation was concealed. Patients, clinicians, and outcome assessors were blinded. The study was conducted at five US sites.\n\nResults: By day 28, 83.3% of ANG-3777 patients achieved the primary outcome versus 50% in placebo (log-rank test: χ²=2.799, P=0.09). ANG-3777 patients had greater increases in urine output, lower serum creatinine, reduced C-reactive protein and neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin, fewer dialysis sessions, shorter hospital stays, significantly less graft failure, and higher estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). Adverse events occurred in a similar percentage of subjects in both arms, but events per subject were twice as high in the placebo arm.\n\nInterpretation: ANG-3777 demonstrated an efficacy signal for improved renal function with a favorable safety profile in renal transplant patients. These findings support further investigation in larger trials to confirm efficacy and safety.\n\nTrial registration: N/A\n\nFunding: Not specified",
