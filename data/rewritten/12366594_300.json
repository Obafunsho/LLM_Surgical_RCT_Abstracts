A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Near-Infrared Light Device for Peripheral Venous Catheter Placement in ICU Patients\n\nBackground: Central venous catheters (CVCs) are essential in intensive care units (ICUs) but should be removed when no longer needed to reduce infection risk. Peripheral venous catheter (PVC) placement can be challenging due to factors like oedema. This study evaluates whether a near-infrared light device (AccuVein AV500) improves the first-attempt success rate of PVC placement compared to the landmark approach.\n\nMethods: This investigator-initiated, prospective, multicentre, randomised controlled superiority trial was conducted in four French ICUs. A total of 380 patients were randomised in a 1:1 ratio to either the near-infrared light device or the landmark approach, with stratification by centre and anticipated difficulty of venous access. The primary outcome was the first-attempt success rate of PVC placement, measured immediately after the attempt. Randomisation was performed using a centralised web-based system, and blinding was not possible due to the nature of the intervention. Eligibility criteria included adult ICU patients with an existing CVC no longer indicated.\n\nResults: The trial is ongoing, and results are not yet available. The study aims to demonstrate a significant improvement in the first-attempt success rate with the near-infrared light device. The analysis will be conducted on a modified intention-to-treat basis, including only analysable patients.\n\nInterpretation: If successful, the near-infrared light device could become a valuable tool for improving PVC placement success in ICU patients, potentially reducing the need for CVCs and associated complications. This could lead to changes in clinical practice and improved patient outcomes.\n\nTrial registration: Clinicaltrials.gov: NCT06234293.\n\nFunding: The study is sponsored by the Hospital University Centre of Orléans, France.",
