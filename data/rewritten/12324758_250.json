This study aimed to evaluate whether perioperative acetaminophen administration reduces the risk of postoperative AKI in adult cardiac surgery patients.\n\nMethods: A systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted, including nine randomised controlled trials and four observational studies. The primary outcome was the incidence of postoperative AKI, measured within the hospital stay. Randomisation methods and allocation concealment were not specified in the included studies. Blinding of outcome assessors, patients, and clinicians varied across studies. The study was registered under PROSPERO (CRD42024514111).\n\nResults: A total of 11,583 patients were analysed, with 7,833 receiving acetaminophen and 3,750 in the control group. Acetaminophen administration was associated with a lower incidence of AKI [OR 0.62 (95% CI 0.40–0.97), P = 0.04]. Additionally, acetaminophen use was linked to reduced in-hospital mortality, delirium rates, and shorter ICU stays. No significant adverse events were reported.\n\nInterpretation: Perioperative acetaminophen administration may reduce AKI incidence and in-hospital mortality in cardiac surgery patients. Further large multicenter randomised controlled trials are needed to confirm these findings. There was no funding source for this study.",
