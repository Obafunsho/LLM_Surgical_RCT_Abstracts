This study evaluates the prophylactic use of inotropic agents to prevent LCOS in adults undergoing cardiac surgery.\n\nMethods: We conducted a randomised controlled trial with individual participant randomisation. Eligibility included adults undergoing cardiac surgery without signs of LCOS. Participants were randomised to receive inotropic agents or control (standard care, placebo, or other inotropes). The primary outcome was the incidence of LCOS within 48 hours post-surgery. Randomisation was computer-generated, with allocation concealment via sealed envelopes. Blinding included outcome assessors, patients, and clinicians.\n\nResults: A total of 3307 participants were randomised: 1654 to the intervention and 1653 to the control group. Analysis included 1620 in the intervention and 1625 in the control group, using an intention-to-treat approach. Levosimendan reduced LCOS risk (RR 0.43, 95% CI 0.25 to 0.74) and mortality (RR 0.65, 95% CI 0.43 to 0.97). Adverse events were similar between groups. Trial registration: NCT12345678.\n\nInterpretation: Prophylactic levosimendan may reduce LCOS incidence and mortality compared to placebo. Further trials are needed to confirm these findings and explore other inotropes.\n\nFunding: Supported by [Funding Source].",
