A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Perioperative Management of Renin-Angiotensin System Inhibitors\n\nBackground: This randomised controlled trial assessed the effect of discontinuing renin-angiotensin system (RAS) inhibitors on perioperative myocardial injury, stratified by preoperative plasma N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) levels.\n\nMethods: Conducted at six UK centres, patients aged ≥60 years undergoing elective noncardiac surgery were randomised 1:1 to either stop or continue RAS inhibitors. Randomisation was centrally performed with minimisation by centre, surgical procedure, and RAS inhibitor type. The primary outcome was myocardial injury, defined as plasma high-sensitivity troponin-T ≥15 ng/L or a ≥5 ng/L increase within 48 hours post-surgery. Blinding was applied to investigators, clinicians, and patients. The trial was registered under ISRCTN17251494.\n\nResults: Of 262 randomised participants, 241 were analysed (intention-to-treat). Among these, 101 had NT-proBNP >100 pg/ml. Myocardial injury occurred in 63/101 (62.4%) with NT-proBNP >100 pg/ml and 45/140 (32.1%) with NT-proBNP <100 pg/ml (OR 3.50, 95% CI 2.05–5.99; P <0.001). In the NT-proBNP <100 pg/ml group, 30/75 (40%) who stopped RAS inhibitors had myocardial injury versus 15/65 (23.1%) who continued (OR 2.22, 95% CI 1.06–4.65; P =0.020). Adverse events were not specifically reported.\n\nInterpretation: Discontinuing RAS inhibitors in lower-risk patients (NT-proBNP <100 pg/ml) increased the risk of myocardial injury. The study highlights the importance of NT-proBNP in perioperative risk stratification. Funding was provided by the Royal College of Anaesthetists and the National Institute for Healthcare Research.",
