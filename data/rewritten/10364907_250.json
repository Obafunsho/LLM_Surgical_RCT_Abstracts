A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Decision Support Interventions for Older Women with Breast Cancer\n\nBackground: This cluster randomised controlled trial (cRCT) evaluated the impact of decision support interventions (DESIs) on treatment decision-making in older women with breast cancer.\n\nMethods: The study was conducted in 46 breast units in England and Wales, recruiting women aged 70 years or above with operable breast cancer. Units were randomised 1:1 to either DESIs or usual care, stratified by primary endocrine therapy and chemotherapy rates. The DESIs included an online tool, booklet, and decision aid. The primary outcome was quality of life (QoL) at 6 months, assessed using the EORTC QLQ-C30. Secondary outcomes included decision quality, survival, and treatment choice. Randomisation was by block, and allocation was concealed. Blinding was not feasible.\n\nResults: A total of 1339 women were randomised (670 intervention, 669 usual care) between December 2015 and June 2018. Intention-to-treat analysis showed no significant difference in global QoL at 6 months (difference -0.20, 95% CI -2.69 to 2.29; P = 0.900). Knowledge about treatments was greater in the intervention arm (94% vs. 74%; P = 0.003). Treatment choice was altered, with a higher rate of primary endocrine therapy in the intervention group (21.0% vs. 15.4%; P = 0.029). Survival was similar in both arms. No significant adverse events were reported.\n\nTrial registration: EudraCT 2015-004220-61, ISRCTN46099296.\n\nFunding: Funded by the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR).",
