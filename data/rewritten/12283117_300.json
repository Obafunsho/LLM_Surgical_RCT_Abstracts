Inclusion criteria included prospective studies and randomised clinical trials. CLTI reintervention data were drawn from the BEST-CLI trial. Cancer recurrence data were sourced from the National Cancer Institute and American Cancer Society. The primary outcome was the 3-year recurrence rate. Randomisation and allocation concealment methods were not specified. Blinding details were not provided.\n\nResults: The pooled 3-year DFU recurrence rate was 58%, while the CLTI reintervention rate was 50%. These rates are comparable to cancer recurrence rates: breast (25%-40%), prostate (30%-40%), colorectal (30%-50%), and lung (60%-80%). Despite comparable risks, DFU and CLTI remain underrecognized in terms of their recurrent burden.\n\nInterpretation: The data underscore the need to reframe healed DFU and post-intervention CLTI not as an endpoint but as a remission requiring structured surveillance and proactive management, similar to oncology. Developing interdisciplinary survivorship care plans for individuals with DFU and CLTI, modeled on those used in cancer care, may improve communication, enhance secondary prevention, and foster more ulcer-free, hospital-free, and activity-rich days.\n\nHarm: Adverse events were not reported.\n\nTrial registration: Not provided.\n\nFunding: Not provided.",
