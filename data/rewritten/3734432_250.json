The primary outcome was the incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) over 72 hours. Randomisation was performed using a computer-generated sequence with allocation concealment. Blinding was applied to outcome assessors, patients, and clinicians. The study was conducted at a single tertiary care center.\n\nResults: The Dexa-Ra group had a significantly lower incidence of PONV over 72 hours (p < 0.05) and less severe nausea in the first 6 hours postoperatively. Rescue antiemetic use was less frequent, and complete response was more frequent in the Dexa-Ra group. Pain levels and opioid consumption were lower in the Dexa-Ra group during the 6- to 24-hour period and overall. No significant differences in wound complications or periprosthetic joint infections were observed between groups.\n\nInterpretation: Dexamethasone addition to ramosetron reduces postoperative emesis and pain without increasing wound complications in TKA patients.
