A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Plasma-Platelet-RBC Ratios in Emergency Laparotomy\n\nBackground: The Pragmatic Randomized Optimal Platelet and Plasma Ratios (PROPPR) trial suggested improved survival with a 1:1:1 plasma-platelet-RBC ratio in massive transfusion. We aimed to assess if this ratio improves survival after emergency laparotomy.\n\nMethods: This randomised controlled trial involved severely injured patients predicted to require massive transfusion at 12 level I North American trauma centers. Participants were randomised to receive either a 1:1:1 or 1:1:2 ratio. The primary outcome was survival at 24 hours and 30 days post-emergency laparotomy, defined as laparotomy within 90 minutes of arrival. Randomisation was computer-generated, with allocation concealment ensured. Blinding was not applicable.\n\nResults: A total of 680 patients were randomised, with 338 in the 1:1:1 group and 342 in the 1:1:2 group. Of these, 346 underwent emergency laparotomy. The 24-hour survival was 86.8% for 1:1:1 and 83.1% for 1:1:2 (p=0.29), while 30-day survival was 79.3% for 1:1:1 and 75.0% for 1:1:2 (p=0.30). No significant differences in adverse events were reported between groups.\n\nInterpretation: The resuscitation strategy did not significantly affect the need for emergency laparotomy, time to laparotomy, or survival outcomes.
