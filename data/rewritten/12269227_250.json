A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial on Coagulation Management in Cardiothoracic Surgery\n\nBackground: Coagulation management in cardiothoracic surgery is complex, requiring a balance between hemostasis and anticoagulation. This study evaluates the effectiveness of combined pharmacological and nonpharmacological strategies.\n\nMethods: This randomised controlled trial was conducted in a cardiothoracic surgery setting. Participants were eligible if they were undergoing cardiothoracic surgery and met specific inclusion criteria. The intervention group received tranexamic acid and heparin, supplemented with nonpharmacological techniques, while the control group received standard care. The primary outcome was the reduction in postoperative bleeding, measured over a 24-hour period. Randomisation was performed using a computer-generated sequence, with allocation concealment ensured by sealed envelopes. Blinding was applied to outcome assessors.\n\nResults: A total of 200 participants were randomised, with 100 in each group, between January 2020 and June 2021. Analysis was conducted on 98 participants in the intervention group and 97 in the control group using an intention-to-treat approach. The intervention group showed a significant reduction in postoperative bleeding (mean difference = 5.2 mL, 95% CI 3.1 to 7.3; p = 0.01). Adverse events were reported in 3% of the intervention group and 1% of the control group.\n\nInterpretation: The combined use of pharmacological and nonpharmacological strategies significantly reduces postoperative bleeding in cardiothoracic surgery. Further research should explore long-term effects and cost-effectiveness.\n\nTrial registration: N/A\n\nFunding: The study was funded by [source not provided].",
