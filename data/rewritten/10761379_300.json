The intervention involved TPF chemotherapy followed by surgery if resectable, or concurrent chemoradiation if unresectable. The primary outcome was the R0 resection rate, assessed post-surgery. Randomisation and blinding were not applicable. The study was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02976909).\n\nResults: From July 2004 to February 2019, 47 patients were enrolled. Surgery was performed on 27 patients (57.4%), achieving R0 resection in 25 (53.2%). Pathologic complete response was observed in four patients (8.5%). The median follow-up was 44.8 months. The median overall survival (OS) was 41.9 months (95% CI, 18.6–65.3), and median progression-free survival (PFS) was 38.7 months (95% CI, 23.5–53.9). The 3-year OS rate was 54.4%, with 65.4% for R0 patients. No serious perioperative complications or deaths were reported. Adverse events were consistent with known profiles of the chemotherapy regimen.\n\nInterpretation: TPF chemotherapy followed by surgery is a feasible and promising treatment strategy for BR-ESCC, significantly improving survival outcomes. The trial highlights the need for further research to enhance R0 resection rates and explore more effective induction treatments. The study was funded by Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center.",
