A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial Comparing Porous Tantalum Cementless and Cemented Tibial Components in Total Knee Arthroplasty\n\nBackground: This randomised controlled trial investigates whether a porous tantalum cementless tibial component offers superior clinical outcomes compared to a conventional cemented component in total knee arthroplasty (TKA).\n\nMethods: We randomised 145 patients into two groups: Group 1 received a porous tantalum cementless tibial component, and Group 2 received a cemented conventional tibial component in posterior cruciate retaining TKA. Randomisation was conducted using a computer-generated sequence with allocation concealment via sealed envelopes. The primary outcomes were the Knee Society Score (KSS) and WOMAC Osteoarthritis Index, assessed preoperatively and at 15 days, 6 months, and 5 years postoperatively. Outcome assessors were blinded to group allocation.\n\nResults: At 5-year follow-up, the mean KSS was 90.4 (range, 68–100; 95% CI, ±1.6) for Group 1 and 86.5 (range, 56–99; 95% CI, ±2.4) for Group 2, with an effect size of 3.88 ± 2.87. The mean WOMAC score was 15.1 (range, 0–51; 95% CI, ±2.6) for Group 1 and 19.1 (range, 4–61; 95% CI, ±2.9) for Group 2, with an effect size of -4.0 ± 3.9. No significant differences were found in the frequency of complications or aseptic loosening between the groups.\n\nInterpretation: The findings indicate small differences in clinical outcomes between the porous tantalum cementless and conventional cemented tibial components. The implications for long-term cost-effectiveness and performance require further investigation.\n\nTrial registration: [Trial registration number]\n\nFunding: [Source of funding]",
