A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Validation of the nProfiler 1 Stomach Cancer Assay in a Randomised Controlled Trial\n\nBackground: The nProfiler 1 Stomach Cancer Assay (nProfiler1) predicts responses to fluorouracil-based adjuvant chemotherapy in gastric cancer. This study aimed to validate nProfiler1 using a cohort from the POST trial, a randomised phase III trial comparing S-1 plus cisplatin (SP) and S-1 plus docetaxel (DS).\n\nMethods: The POST trial was an open-label, multicenter, randomised controlled trial conducted in South Korea. Patients with stage III gastric cancer post-gastrectomy were randomised to SP or DS. The nProfiler1 assay stratified patients into risk and benefit groups using formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded slides. The primary outcome was disease-free survival (DFS) over a median follow-up of 57.9 months. Randomisation was computer-generated, and allocation was concealed. Blinding was not applied.\n\nResults: Of 153 randomised patients, 118 were analysed (60 SP, 58 DS) using a post-hoc approach. No significant difference in DFS or overall survival (OS) was observed between groups. The prognostic classifier predicted OS in the SP group (p=0.043) but not in the DS group (p=0.594). The chemotherapy-benefit group showed numerically longer DFS in both groups. No significant adverse events were reported.\n\nInterpretation: The nProfiler1 assay provides insights into the prognosis and efficacy of fluorouracil plus platinum regimens but not docetaxel-containing regimens. Further validation is needed. Trial registration: NCT01283217. Funding: Not specified.",
