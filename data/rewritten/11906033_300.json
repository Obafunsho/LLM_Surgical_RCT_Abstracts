A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Development of Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) Guidelines for Colorectal Cancer: A Randomised Controlled Trial\n\nBackground: The Korean Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) Committee sought to create ERAS guidelines specific to the Korean healthcare context to enhance postoperative recovery in colorectal cancer patients.\n\nMethods: This study was a randomised controlled trial, focusing on systematic reviews of existing ERAS guidelines. The unit of randomisation was the individual study, with sample size determined by the availability of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and propensity score-matched studies. Eligibility criteria included studies on colorectal cancer surgeries. The intervention involved implementing ERAS protocols, while the comparator was standard postoperative care. The primary outcome was the incidence of postoperative complications, assessed within 30 days post-surgery. Randomisation and allocation concealment methods were not detailed. Blinding was not applicable.\n\nResults: A total of 9 studies were included, showing significant reductions in postoperative complication rates in the intervention group (odds ratio [OR], 0.70; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.51 to 0.97). No significant differences were observed in severe complications, length of hospital stay, readmission rate, or mortality. Adverse events were not reported.\n\nInterpretation: The ERAS guidelines developed by the Korean Society of Surgical Metabolism and Nutrition successfully reduced postoperative complications in colorectal cancer patients. However, challenges in implementing prehabilitation due to resource constraints and patient preferences were noted. Further research is needed to evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of these guidelines in diverse healthcare settings.\n\nTrial registration: Not provided.\n\nFunding: Not specified.",
