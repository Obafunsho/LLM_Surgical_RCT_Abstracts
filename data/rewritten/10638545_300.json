A 300-word version\n\nTitle: A Randomised Controlled Trial of Antimicrobial Sutures in Hand Trauma Surgery\n\nBackground: Surgical site infection (SSI) poses a significant risk in hand trauma surgery. This study aimed to assess the feasibility of a definitive trial comparing antimicrobial sutures to standard sutures in reducing SSI.\n\nMethods: This multicentre feasibility randomised controlled trial was conducted at three NHS hospitals in the UK. Participants were adults with hand or wrist injuries requiring surgery. Eligibility criteria included age 18 or older, with exclusions for allergies to Triclosan and inability to consent. The intervention group received antimicrobial sutures, while the control group received standard sutures. The primary outcome was feasibility, measured by recruitment, compliance, and retention over 6 months. Randomisation was 1:1, stratified by age and injury type, using a secure online service. Participants were blinded to allocation, while surgeons were aware of the treatment. \n\nResults: From March to November 2022, 116 participants were randomised (60 intervention, 56 control). Of 227 screened, 89.5% were eligible, and 84.7% consented. Retention was 57.5% at 30 days, 52% at 90 days, and 45.1% at 6 months. SSI incidence exceeded 20% in both groups. Hand function initially deteriorated but improved over time. No adverse events related to treatment allocation were reported. The analysis was conducted on an intention-to-treat basis.\n\nInterpretation: The high SSI risk in hand trauma surgery highlights the need for effective interventions. A definitive trial of antimicrobial sutures is feasible if retention improves. Strategies to enhance retention should be considered in future trials.\n\nTrial registration: ISRCTN10771059\n\nFunding: The study was supported by the UK Trauma Patient and Public Involvement Group.",
