However, their relevance is questioned due to ethical concerns and translational limitations.\n\nMethods: This review evaluates the contribution of animal models to complement-targeted therapies. We assess areas where animal studies have elucidated disease mechanisms and preclinical evaluations, alongside instances where findings failed to translate to human trials.\n\nResults: Animal models have been indispensable in understanding disease mechanisms and developing complement therapeutics. However, differences in the complement system between animals and humans have led to translational challenges. Innovations in animal research aim to improve translatability.\n\nInterpretation: While animal models have contributed significantly to complement research, their role is evolving. The rise of animal-free methods offers alternative tools, but animal models remain valuable for exploring complement biology and disease mechanisms. Ethical concerns and translational limitations must be addressed to justify their continued use.",
