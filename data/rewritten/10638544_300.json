This trial evaluated the efficacy of neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) as an adjunct to standard care in improving walking distances.\n\nMethods: Conducted in 11 UK hospitals, this multicentre, randomised controlled trial included patients with IC. Participants were randomised 1:1 to receive NMES plus local standard care or local standard care alone. The primary outcome was the change in absolute walking distance (AWD) at 3 months, assessed by a standardised treadmill test. Randomisation was computer-generated with allocation concealment, and outcome assessors were blinded. A sample size of 192 was calculated to detect a 60 m difference in AWD with 90% power.\n\nResults: Between February 2018 and March 2020, 200 participants were randomised; 100 to NMES and 100 to control. Primary analysis included 160 participants (intention-to-treat). NMES showed no significant improvement in AWD (0.83 units; 95% CI, −0.67 to 2.34; p = 0.28). Supervised exercise therapy (SET) improved AWD compared to best medical therapy (3.29 units; 95% CI, 1.77 to 4.82; p < 0.001). NMES improved AWD in mild IC (2.88 units; 95% CI, 0.51 to 5.25; p = 0.02). No device-related serious adverse events were reported, with 13 events in the NMES group and 16 in the control group, none related to the device.\n\nInterpretation: SET is effective for IC, and NMES may provide additional benefits for patients with mild IC. These findings suggest NMES could be a valuable adjunct in specific patient populations. Trial registration: ISRCTN18242823.
