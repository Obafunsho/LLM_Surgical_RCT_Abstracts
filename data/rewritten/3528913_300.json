A 300-word version\n\nTitle: A Randomised Controlled Trial Comparing Mini-Subvastus and Standard Medial Parapatellar Approaches in Total Knee Arthroplasty\n\nBackground: Minimally invasive surgical (MIS) techniques in total knee arthroplasty (TKA) are proposed to improve recovery and reduce pain, yet their effects on gait and thigh muscle strength are unclear.\n\nMethods: This randomised controlled trial involved 40 patients undergoing TKA, randomised to either a mini-subvastus or standard medial parapatellar approach. The unit of randomisation was the individual patient, with a sample size determined to detect clinically meaningful differences. Participants were evaluated preoperatively and 2 months postoperatively. Subjective functional outcomes and quality of life (QOL) were assessed using SF-12, Knee Society Score (KSS), Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), UCLA activity, and a patient milestone diary. Isometric thigh muscle strength and gait were evaluated using three-dimensional analysis during level walking and stair climbing. Randomisation was computer-generated, and allocation was concealed. Outcome assessors were blinded, but patients and clinicians were not.\n\nResults: Improvements were observed in both groups in functional scores, QOL, and gait parameters. Isometric quadriceps strength increased but remained lower than sound limbs. No significant differences were found between groups in KSS, SF-12, KOOS, UCLA activity, patient milestone diary, isometric strength, or gait parameters, except for a marginally higher stair ascent speed in the MIS group. No adverse events were reported.\n\nInterpretation: The MIS approach does not confer a substantial early functional advantage over the standard approach in TKA.\n\nTrial registration: [Trial registration number]\n\nFunding: [Source of funding]",
