  "abstract": "2. 300-word version\n\nBackground: This study aimed to evaluate trends in abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair in the Australian public sector over the past two decades, focusing on the transition from open AAA repair (OAR) to endovascular AAA repair (EVAR).\n\nMethods: Data from the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) Procedures Data Cubes were used to extract information on AAA repairs from 2000 to 2021. Population data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics was used to calculate the incidence of each type of repair per 100,000 population.\n\nResults: A total of 65,529 AAA repairs were performed in the Australian public sector from 2000 to 2021. EVARs accounted for 64.4% (42,205) and OARs accounted for 35.6% (23,324) of these procedures. EVAR surpassed OAR as the preferred method of AAA repair in 2006. This trend was consistent across both genders and all age groups. Regression analysis demonstrated a significant decrease in OAR (β = −0.77, p < 0.001 for males; β = −0.21, p < 0.001 for females) and a concurrent significant increase in EVAR (β = 0.53, p < 0.001 for males; β = 0.15, p < 0.001 for females).\n\nInterpretation: The study demonstrates a consistent and steady transition from OAR to EVAR over the 21-year period, with EVAR becoming the preferred method of AAA repair relatively early in Australia compared to other countries. This shift was observed consistently in both males and females and across all age groups, with a particularly marked increase among octogenarians. Further research is needed to investigate the medium- and long-term outcomes of newer stent grafts to ascertain the continued viability and effectiveness of this trend in AAA treatment.",
