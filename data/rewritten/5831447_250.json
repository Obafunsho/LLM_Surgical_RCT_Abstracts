A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Incentive Spirometry in Bariatric Surgery Patients\n\nBackground: Obesity and foregut surgery increase the risk of postoperative pulmonary complications in bariatric surgery patients. The effectiveness of postoperative incentive spirometry (IS) remains uncertain.\n\nMethods: This randomised noninferiority clinical trial was conducted at a single-center tertiary referral teaching hospital. Patients undergoing bariatric surgery from May 1, 2015, to June 30, 2016, were randomised to receive either postoperative IS (control group) or clinical observation without IS (test group). Randomisation was performed using a computer-generated sequence, and allocation was concealed. The primary outcome was the frequency of hypoxemia, defined as an arterial oxygen saturation (Sa o 2) level of less than 92% without supplementation at 6, 12, and 24 postoperative hours. Secondary outcomes included Sa o 2 levels at these times and the rate of 30-day postoperative pulmonary complications. Analysis was based on the evaluable population.\n\nResults: A total of 224 patients were randomised, with 112 in each group. No significant differences in postoperative hypoxemia were observed between the control and test groups at 6 (11.9% vs 10.4%; P = .72), 12 (5.4% vs 8.2%; P = .40), or 24 (3.7% vs 4.6%; P = .73) hours. Sa o 2 levels and 30-day pulmonary complications were also similar between groups. No adverse events were reported.\n\nInterpretation: Postoperative IS did not affect hypoxemia, Sa o 2 levels, or pulmonary complications. Routine IS use is not recommended after bariatric surgery.
