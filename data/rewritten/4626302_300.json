A 300-word version\n\nTitle: A Randomised Controlled Trial of a Decision Aid for Smoking Cessation in Elective Surgery Patients\n\nBackground: Decision aids can enhance patient involvement in healthcare decision-making. This study aimed to evaluate a decision aid for discussing smoking behavior change options before and after elective surgery.\n\nMethods: A randomised, two-group pilot study was conducted in a preoperative clinic. Participants were smokers preparing for elective surgery, with eligibility criteria including current smoking status and scheduled elective surgery. The decision aid, consisting of three laminated cards, was designed to facilitate discussions on continuing smoking, temporary abstinence, or quitting smoking. The primary outcome was decisional quality, measured using the Decisional Conflict and OPTION scales over a preoperative period. Randomisation was performed at the patient level, with allocation concealment ensured. Neither patients nor clinicians were blinded.\n\nResults: A total of 130 patients were randomised: 65 to the decision aid group and 65 to usual care, recruited over a specified period. The decision aid significantly improved decisional quality (Cohen’s d = 0.76) and patient involvement (Cohen’s d = 1.20) compared to usual care (p < 0.05). However, it did not affect perioperative smoking behavior, including the distribution of or adherence to choices. No adverse events were reported in either group.\n\nInterpretation: The decision aid improved decisional quality and patient involvement but did not change smoking behavior. These findings suggest that while decision aids can enhance decision-making processes, additional strategies may be necessary to influence behavior change in the perioperative setting. Further research is needed to explore these strategies.\n\nTrial registration: [Trial registration number]\n\nFunding: [Source of funding]",
