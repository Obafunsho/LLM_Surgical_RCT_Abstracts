A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Alfentanil in Hysteroscopic Surgery\n\nBackground: This randomised controlled trial aimed to determine the median effective dose (ED50) and the 95% effective dose (ED95) of alfentanil in inhibiting responses to cervical dilation when combined with ciprofol, and to explore its effect on reducing ciprofol requirement during hysteroscopy.\n\nMethods: One hundred and forty female patients, ASA grade I or II, aged 18–65 years, scheduled for hysteroscopy at Women’s Hospital, Zhejiang University, were randomised to receive 8 µg·kg−1, 10 µg·kg−1, 12 µg·kg−1, 14 µg·kg−1 alfentanil, or 0.15 µg·kg−1 sufentanil. Randomisation was computer-generated and allocation was concealed in sealed envelopes. Blinding included patients, outcome assessors, and clinicians. The primary outcome was the ED50 and ED95 of alfentanil, measured using probit analysis. Secondary outcomes included ciprofol requirement, emergence time, and pain scores.\n\nResults: The ED50 and ED95 of alfentanil were 9.73 µg·kg−1 (95% CI 8.57 to 10.56) and 15.02 µg·kg−1 (95% CI 13.57 to 18.12), respectively. Ciprofol requirements were significantly lower in the 10–14 µg·kg−1 alfentanil groups compared to the 8 µg·kg−1 and sufentanil groups (p < 0.001). Emergence time was shorter in the 10–12 µg·kg−1 alfentanil groups. Pain scores at 30 min and 1 h post-surgery were lower in the 10–14 µg·kg−1 groups. The incidence of intraoperative hypotension was lower in the 8–14 µg·kg−1 alfentanil groups compared to sufentanil (p = 0.044), while desaturation was higher in the 14 µg·kg−1 group (p < 0.001).\n\nInterpretation: Alfentanil at 10–12 µg·kg−1 provides effective ciprofol-sparing, earlier emergence, better analgesia, and fewer hemodynamic events compared to sufentanil. However, 14 µg·kg−1 poses a risk of desaturation. Further research is needed to confirm optimal dosing.\n\nTrial registration: ChiCTR2400080232.\n\nFunding: Not specified.",
