A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Aortic Valve Replacement on Myocardial Function\n\nBackground: The effect of aortic valve replacement (AVR) for aortic stenosis on perioperative myocardial function is unclear. This study aimed to characterize the effect of intraoperative events on left ventricular (LV) function using echocardiographic measures of myocardial deformation and to evaluate right ventricular (RV) function.\n\nMethods: In this supplementary analysis of 100 patients enrolled in a clinical trial (NCT01187329), 97 patients underwent AVR for aortic stenosis. Eligibility criteria included patients with aortic stenosis undergoing AVR. A standardized intraoperative transesophageal echocardiographic examination was performed before surgical incision and after chest closure. Echocardiographic images were analyzed for global longitudinal myocardial strain and strain rate. Randomization and allocation concealment methods were not specified. Blinding details were not provided.\n\nResults: Echocardiographic images were acceptable for analysis in 72 patients for LV strain, 67 for LV strain rate, and 54 for RV strain and strain rate. LV strain did not change significantly [difference: 0.7 (97.6% CI: 0.2, 1.5)%; P = 0.07], while LV systolic strain rate improved [−0.3 (−0.4, −0.2) sec−1; P < 0.001]. RV systolic strain worsened [difference: 4.6 (3.1, 6.0)%; P < 0.001], with no change in RV systolic strain rate [0.0 (97.6% CI: −0.1, 0.1); P = 0.83]. Adverse events were not reported.\n\nInterpretation: LV function improved after AVR, demonstrated by improved longitudinal strain rate, while RV function was reduced. Trial registration: NCT01187329.
