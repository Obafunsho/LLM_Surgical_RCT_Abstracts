A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial on Amiodarone for POAF Prevention in CABG Patients\n\nBackground: Postoperative atrial fibrillation (POAF) is a prevalent complication following cardiac surgery, leading to increased morbidity and healthcare costs. This study investigates the impact of amiodarone on POAF incidence and onset timing in moderate and high-risk patients undergoing elective coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG).\n\nMethods: This randomised controlled trial was conducted at Medical Institute Bayer, Tuzla, from 2019 to 2024, involving 454 patients. Participants were stratified using the McSPI AF Risk Index, POAF Score, and CHA2DS2-VASc Score. Moderate and high-risk patients received amiodarone with beta blockers (Amiodarone group), while low-risk patients received beta blockers only. The primary outcome was POAF incidence, assessed over the hospital stay. Randomisation was computer-generated, with allocation concealment via sealed envelopes. Blinding was not applied.\n\nResults: A total of 227 patients were randomised to each group. POAF occurred in 5.95% of the Amiodarone group compared to 9.25% in the beta blocker group, with an overall incidence of 15.2%. The relative risk reduction was 27% (RR = 0.27, 95% CI = 0.105-0.689, p = 0.006). Kaplan-Meier analysis indicated a delayed POAF onset in the Amiodarone group (median: 48h vs. 33h, p = 0.0007). Cox regression confirmed a 73% lower risk of early POAF (HR = 0.27, 95% CI = 0.105-0.689, p = 0.006). No significant adverse events were reported.\n\nInterpretation: Amiodarone combined with beta blockers effectively reduces POAF incidence and delays its onset in patients undergoing CABG. These findings support its use in postoperative management. Trial registration: N/A. Funding: Not specified.",
