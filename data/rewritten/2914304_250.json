A 250-word version\n\nTitle: The Carotid Revascularization, Endarterectomy vs. Stenting Trial (CREST): A Randomised Controlled Trial\n\nBackground: CREST is a randomised controlled trial comparing carotid artery stenting (CAS) to carotid endarterectomy (CEA) in patients with carotid artery stenosis.\n\nMethods: This trial enrolled 2,522 participants from 117 centers across North America. Participants with symptomatic carotid stenosis (≥50% by angiography, ≥70% by ultrasound) or asymptomatic stenosis (≥60% by angiography, ≥70% by ultrasound) were randomised 1:1 to CAS or CEA. The primary outcome was the composite of stroke, myocardial infarction, and all-cause mortality during a 30-day peri-procedural period, and ipsilateral stroke over up to 4 years. Randomisation was computer-generated, with allocation concealment ensured. Blinding was not specified.\n\nResults: 1,261 participants were randomised to each group. The analysis approach was not specified. The primary outcome results, effect size, and precision are not provided. Adverse events were not detailed.\n\nInterpretation: CREST aims to provide insights into the efficacy of CAS versus CEA in preventing major cardiovascular events. The trial's large sample size and rigorous credentialing process enhance its reliability. Trial registration: Not provided. Funding: Sponsored by the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS).",
