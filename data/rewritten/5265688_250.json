A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Everolimus Plus Reduced-Dose Tacrolimus in Liver Transplant Recipients\n\nBackground: This international, randomised controlled trial evaluated the efficacy and renal outcomes of everolimus plus reduced-dose tacrolimus (EVR + rTAC) compared to standard-dose tacrolimus (TAC-C) in de novo liver transplant recipients.\n\nMethods: Participants were adult recipients of primary liver transplants from deceased donors, with an eGFR of 30 mL/min per 1.73 m² or greater. They were randomised 1:1:1 to EVR + rTAC, TAC-WD, or TAC-C. Randomisation was stratified by pretransplant HCV status and eGFR. The primary outcome was the composite of treated biopsy-proven acute rejection, graft loss, or death at 12 months. The study was open-label, and the analysis was intention-to-treat.\n\nResults: Of 719 participants, 211 were from North America. At month 12, the composite efficacy endpoint was 10.9% for EVR + rTAC and 13.1% for TAC-C. Mean changes in eGFR favored EVR + rTAC at months 12 (+3.7 vs −4.5 mL/min per 1.73 m²; P = 0.032) and 24 (+2.7 vs −6.6 mL/min per 1.73 m²; P = 0.042). Adverse events were more frequent in the EVR + rTAC group, leading to higher discontinuation rates.\n\nInterpretation: Despite higher comorbidities in the North American cohort, EVR + rTAC improved renal function without compromising efficacy compared to TAC-C.
