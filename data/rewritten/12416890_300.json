This study aimed to determine if a higher-than-standard CPB flow improves renal blood flow, oxygen demand–supply relationship, and function, and reduces tubular injury.\n\nMethods: This prospective, nonblinded, parallel-arm randomised controlled trial was conducted at a Swedish hospital. Thirty-six adult patients undergoing cardiac surgery were randomised to receive either high flow (2.9 l · min–1 · m–2, n = 19) or standard flow (2.4 l · min–1 · m–2, n = 17) during CPB. The primary outcome was renal blood flow, measured by para-aminohippuric acid clearance, over 60 minutes. Randomisation was stratified by eGFR and left ventricular ejection fraction using an online tool. Neither patients nor clinicians were blinded.\n\nResults: High flow led to a larger increase in systemic oxygen delivery (100 [95% CI, 60 to 141] vs. 31 [1.9 to 65] ml · min–1 · m–2; P < 0.001) and maintained target mean arterial pressure at a lower norepinephrine dose (0.03 [–0.01 to 0.06] vs. 0.10 [0.02 to 0.19] µg · kg–1 · min–1; P = 0.048). No differences in renal blood flow or oxygen extraction were observed between groups. Glomerular filtration rate increased in the high-flow group (6.4 [1.9 to 10.9] ml · min–1 · 1.73 m–2; P = 0.044). Tubular injury marker release was less pronounced in the high-flow group (P = 0.049). No perfusion-related adverse events were reported.\n\nInterpretation: A 20% higher-than-standard CPB flow during cardiac surgery improved renal function and reduced tubular injury marker release, although no change in renal blood flow or oxygen demand–supply relationship was detected.\n\nTrial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT272790.\n\nFunding: Supported by Swedish State, ALF-agreement, Swedish Heart and Lung Foundation, and Gothenburg Society of Medicine.",
