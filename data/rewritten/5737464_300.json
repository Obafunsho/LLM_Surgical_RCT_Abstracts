A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial Comparing Whole Slide Imaging and Microscopy for Primary Diagnosis in Surgical Pathology\n\nBackground: This study aimed to demonstrate that whole slide imaging (WSI) is noninferior to microscopy for primary diagnosis in surgical pathology.\n\nMethods: A blinded randomised noninferiority trial was conducted at four institutions in the United States, involving 1992 surgical pathology cases. The unit of randomisation was the individual case. Cases were scanned and converted to WSI, then randomised. Sixteen pathologists interpreted cases by microscopy or WSI, followed by a wash-out period of at least four weeks, after which cases were read by the same observers using the other modality. The primary outcome was the major discordance rate between each modality and the reference standard diagnosis, measured over a 14-month period. Randomisation was performed using an Electronic Data Capture system, with allocation concealment ensured by deidentification. Outcome assessors were blinded to the reference standard.\n\nParticipants: Eligibility criteria included formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded surgical pathology cases, excluding frozen sections and consultation cases. The study was conducted at two academic centers and two commercial laboratories.\n\nIntervention: The intervention was WSI, with microscopy as the comparator.\n\nResults: A total of 1992 cases were analysed, resulting in 15,925 reads. The major discordance rate was 4.9% for WSI and 4.6% for microscopy. The difference in major discordance rates was 0.4% (95% CI, −0.30% to 1.01%), indicating noninferiority of WSI. The difference in major discordance rates was highest in endocrine pathology (1.8%), neoplastic kidney pathology (1.5%), urinary bladder pathology (1.3%), and gynecologic pathology (1.2%). No adverse events were reported.\n\nTrial registration: Not provided.\n\nFunding: Not specified.",
