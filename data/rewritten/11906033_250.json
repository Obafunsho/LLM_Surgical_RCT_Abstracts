A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Development of Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) Guidelines for Colorectal Cancer: A Randomised Controlled Trial\n\nBackground: The Korean Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) Committee aimed to develop ERAS guidelines tailored to the Korean healthcare context to improve postoperative recovery in colorectal cancer patients.\n\nMethods: This study employed a randomised controlled trial design, focusing on systematic reviews of existing ERAS guidelines. The unit of randomisation was the individual study, and the sample size was determined based on the availability of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and propensity score-matched studies. Eligibility criteria included studies targeting colorectal cancer surgeries. The intervention involved the application of ERAS protocols, while the comparator was standard postoperative care. The primary outcome was the incidence of postoperative complications, measured within 30 days post-surgery. Randomisation and allocation concealment methods were not specified. Blinding was not applicable.\n\nResults: A total of 9 studies were included, with significant reductions in postoperative complication rates observed in the intervention group (odds ratio [OR], 0.70; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.51 to 0.97). No significant differences were found in severe complications, length of hospital stay, readmission rate, or mortality. Adverse events were not reported.\n\nInterpretation: The ERAS guidelines developed by the Korean Society of Surgical Metabolism and Nutrition effectively reduced postoperative complications in colorectal cancer patients. Further research is needed to assess the feasibility of implementing these guidelines across different healthcare settings.\n\nTrial registration: Not provided.\n\nFunding: Not specified.",
