This study evaluated the effect of a practice-level preoperative frailty screening and optimization toolkit (OPTI-Surg) on postoperative functional recovery and complications in elderly cancer patients undergoing major surgery.\n\nMethods: This cluster-randomised trial was conducted in thoracic, gastrointestinal, and urologic oncological surgery practices within the National Cancer Institute Community Oncology Research Program (NCORP). Practices were randomised 1:1:1 to usual care (UC), OPTI-Surg, or OPTI-Surg with an implementation coach. Patients aged 70 or above undergoing curative intent surgery were eligible. The primary outcome was 8-week postoperative function (kcal/wk), and the key secondary outcome was complications within 90 days. Mixed models were used to compare UC to the two OPTI-Surg arms combined. Randomisation was performed at the practice level, and allocation concealment was maintained. Blinding was not specified.\n\nResults: From July 2019 to September 2022, 325 patients were enrolled across 29 practices. A total of 199 (64 UC, 135 OPTI-Surg) and 279 (78 UC, 201 OPTI-Surg) were evaluable for primary and secondary analysis, respectively. No significant differences were observed in total caloric expenditure (2.2 UC, 2.0 OPTI-Surg, P = 0.53) or postoperative complications (25.6% UC, 35.3% OPTI-Surg, P = 0.5). Adverse events were not reported.\n\nInterpretation: The OPTI-Surg intervention did not improve postoperative function or reduce complications compared with UC. Future analysis will explore practice-level factors associated with toolkit implementation and differences between coaching and non-coaching arms. Trial registration: [Trial registration number].
