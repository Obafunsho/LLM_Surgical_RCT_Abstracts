A 250-word version\n\nTitle: A Randomised Controlled Trial Comparing Hemiarthroplasty and Internal Fixation for Displaced Femoral Neck Fractures\n\nBackground: This study aimed to compare the long-term outcomes of hemiarthroplasty versus internal fixation for displaced femoral neck fractures (FNF) in patients over 60 years.\n\nMethods: In this randomised controlled trial, 222 patients with FNF were randomised to receive either internal fixation with two parallel screws or bipolar hemiarthroplasty. The study was conducted in a hospital setting. Randomisation was performed using a computer-generated sequence, and allocation was concealed. Outcome assessors were blinded to the treatment groups. The primary outcome was hip function, measured by the Harris hip score, at a minimum follow-up of 5 years. Secondary outcomes included quality of life (Eq5D), activity of daily living (Barthel ADL), patient survival, and frequency of reoperation.\n\nResults: A total of 110 patients were randomised to hemiarthroplasty and 112 to internal fixation. At a mean follow-up of 5.9 years, 68 of the 70 surviving patients were analysed. The mean Harris hip score was 66 in the internal fixation group and 67 in the hemiarthroplasty group (p = 0.96). The mean Eq5D index was 0.50 for internal fixation and 0.34 for hemiarthroplasty (p = 0.10). ADL function was similar between groups. Reoperation was more frequent in the internal fixation group.\n\nInterpretation: Hemiarthroplasty provides predictable long-term outcomes and is preferred over internal fixation for FNF. Further research is needed to compare hemiarthroplasty with total hip arthroplasty.\n\nTrial registration: [Trial registration number]\n\nFunding: [Source of funding]",
