Participants were randomly divided into training (80%) and validation (20%) sets. Independent predictors were identified via multivariate logistic regression and validated using LASSO regression. A nomogram was constructed and evaluated using ROC curves, calibration plots, decision curve analysis (DCA), and bootstrap resampling.\n\nResults: High-risk pathology, defined by solid/micropapillary predominant patterns, complex glandular architecture, STAS, or LVI, was observed in 19.1% of patients. Four independent preoperative predictors were identified: elevated CEA levels, larger CT-measured tumor size, invasive histology on frozen section, and higher mean CT value. The nomogram demonstrated excellent discriminative ability, with AUCs of 0.837 in the training set and 0.865 in the validation set. Internal validation by bootstrap resampling confirmed model stability. No adverse events were reported.\n\nInterpretation: The proposed nomogram integrates routinely available clinical, radiologic, and intraoperative variables to enable individualized preoperative risk assessment for high-risk pathology in stage IA LUL adenocarcinoma. This tool may assist surgeons in tailoring surgical approaches and identifying patients who may benefit from more extensive resection or adjuvant therapy. Prospective external validation is required to confirm generalizability. The study highlights the importance of preoperative planning in optimizing surgical outcomes and suggests that the nomogram could be a valuable addition to clinical practice.\n\nTrial registration: Not provided.\n\nFunding: Not provided.",
