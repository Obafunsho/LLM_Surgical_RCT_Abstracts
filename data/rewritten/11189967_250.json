A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Staple-Line Reinforcement in Pulmonary Resection\n\nBackground: This study aimed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of a new staple-line reinforcement (SLR) device in pulmonary resection.\n\nMethods: This single-center, single-arm prospective study included 48 patients aged >20 years undergoing thoracoscopic lobectomy for suspected lung malignancies at Kobe University Graduate School of Medicine. The primary endpoint was air leakage from the staple line during the intraoperative water sealing test. Secondary endpoints included the location and duration of air leakage and postoperative pulmonary complications. The study was registered in the Japan registry of clinical trials (jRCT1052220008).\n\nResults: The incidence of intraoperative air leakage from the staple line was 6.3% (3/48). Compared to historical controls, the SLR group had a significantly lower incidence of air leakage (6.3% vs. 28.5%, P < 0.001), shorter indwelling chest drainage time (P = 0.049), and reduced length of hospital stay (P < 0.001). No malfunctions of the SLR or stapling device were observed. Prolonged air leakage occurred in two patients (4.2%), with one requiring reoperation.\n\nInterpretation: The use of SLR in pulmonary resection was safe and effective, significantly reducing intraoperative air leakage and improving postoperative recovery compared to conventional methods. The study provides insights for future trials comparing SLR with conventional products.\n\nTrial registration: jRCT1052220008\n\nFunding: Not specified.",
