A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy Omission in Breast Cancer\n\nBackground: The BOOG 2013-08 trial is a non-inferiority randomised controlled trial assessing the oncological safety and impact on health-related quality of life (HRQoL) of omitting sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) in cT1–2 N0 breast cancer patients undergoing breast-conserving surgery (BCS).\n\nMethods: Conducted in multiple centers in the Netherlands, 1733 women with unilateral cT1–2 N0 invasive breast cancer were recruited between May 2015 and January 2022. Participants were randomised to BCS with or without SLNB. The primary outcome was patient-reported arm function and HRQoL, measured up to 3 years post-inclusion using the Lymphoedema Functioning, Disability, and Health Questionnaire and the EORTC QLQ-C30 and QLQ-BR-23 questionnaires. Randomisation was computer-generated, and allocation was concealed. Blinding was not applicable.\n\nResults: Of the 1056 patients asked to complete questionnaires, 821 were analysed (392 with SLNB, 429 without SLNB) using an as-treated approach. The SLNB group experienced a slight, temporary decline in arm function (P < 0.025) and more HRQoL arm and breast symptoms (P < 0.049). High trait anxiety or neuroticism was associated with poorer arm function and lower HRQoL. The effect size for arm function was not clinically relevant, and no significant differences in global HRQoL were observed between groups. No adverse events were reported.\n\nInterpretation: SLNB slightly reduced arm function and temporarily affected HRQoL arm and breast symptoms. Neuroticism significantly negatively impacted arm function and HRQoL. Measuring and stratifying for personality traits is crucial for interpreting patient-reported outcomes and identifying patients needing additional support after surgery. These findings suggest that personality traits have a more significant impact on HRQoL than clinical factors.\n\nTrial registration: NCT02271828.\n\nFunding: Supported by the Netherlands Cancer Institute.",
