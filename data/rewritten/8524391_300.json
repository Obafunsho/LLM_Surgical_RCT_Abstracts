A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Preoperative Inorganic Nitrate in Cardiac Surgery\n\nBackground: Nitric oxide (NO) is a crucial cardiovascular signalling molecule with protective effects against ischaemia–reperfusion injury. This trial assessed whether preoperative inorganic nitrate could reduce troponin T release and other organ injury biomarkers in patients undergoing cardiac surgery.\n\nMethods: Conducted at a Swedish hospital, this single-centre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial included 82 patients aged 18-80 years scheduled for coronary artery bypass grafting with cardiopulmonary bypass. Exclusion criteria encompassed pregnancy, re-do surgery, and significant organ disease. Participants were randomised in blocks of four to receive either oral sodium nitrate (700 mg×2) or placebo (NaCl) before surgery. The primary outcome was troponin T release over 72 hours postoperatively. Randomisation and allocation were concealed, and all participants, clinicians, and outcome assessors were blinded.\n\nResults: Ninety-five patients were randomised, with 42 in the placebo group and 40 in the nitrate group completing the study. Plasma nitrate and nitrite levels were significantly elevated in the nitrate group. The 72-hour troponin T release showed no significant difference between groups (p=0.19). Other organ injury biomarkers, including renal, hepatic, and cerebral markers, were also similar. Perioperative bleeding was 18% less in the nitrate group (p=0.03), with no significant differences in adverse events between groups.\n\nInterpretation: Preoperative administration of inorganic nitrate did not affect troponin T release or other organ injury biomarkers in cardiac surgery patients. The reduction in perioperative bleeding observed in the nitrate group suggests a potential benefit that requires further exploration.\n\nTrial registration: NCT01348971.\n\nFunding: The trial was supported by institutional grants.",
