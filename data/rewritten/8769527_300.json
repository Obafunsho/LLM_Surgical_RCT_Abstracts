This trial aimed to compare outcomes of various surgical methods.\n\nMethods: This multicentre randomised controlled trial was conducted at 13 sites in Sweden from March 2000 to May 2009. Participants with full-thickness rectal prolapse were randomised to a perineal or abdominal approach (randomisation A), or to Delorme’s vs. Altemeier’s (randomisation B) or suture vs. resection rectopexy (randomisation C) based on suitability. Randomisation used concealed envelopes in blocks of four. Primary outcomes were bowel function and quality of life (QoL) measured by Wexner incontinence score and RAND-36 over 3 years. Secondary outcomes included recurrence and complications. Blinding was not applied.\n\nResults: A total of 134 patients were randomised: 18 in randomisation A, 80 in B, and 54 in C. Of these, 122 underwent surgery and were analysed per-protocol. Mean follow-up was 2.6 years. Improvements in Wexner and RAND-36 scores were observed, but no significant differences between groups. Health change scores improved significantly up to 1 year (P < 0.001). At 3 years, recurrence rates were higher for perineal vs. abdominal approaches (5/8 vs. 2/7, P = 0.315) and Delorme’s vs. Altemeier’s (18/31 vs. 15/30, P = 0.611), but differences were not significant. No significant differences in complications were noted. Adverse events included four Clavien–Dindo grade IIIb complications.\n\nInterpretation: All procedures showed significant health improvements post-surgery, but recurrence rates were higher than previously reported. The study lacked power to detect significant differences due to recruitment challenges. Trial registration: NCT04893642. Funding: Not specified.",
