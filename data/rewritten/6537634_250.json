A 250-word version\n\nTitle: A Randomised Controlled Trial of Minimally Invasive Surgery for Intracerebral Hemorrhage\n\nBackground: Minimally invasive surgery, including stereotactic catheter aspiration and recombinant tissue plasminogen activator, may improve outcomes in supratentorial brain hemorrhage. This study evaluates surgical performance and its impact on intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) evacuation and functional outcomes.\n\nMethods: This Phase III randomised controlled trial included 242 participants in the surgical arm of the MISTIE trial. Participants were adults with supratentorial ICH, recruited from multiple centers. Randomisation was computer-generated with allocation concealment. The intervention involved minimally invasive surgery, compared to standard care. The primary outcome was the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score of 0 to 3 at 1 year. Univariate and multivariate models assessed hematoma evacuation efficacy. Blinding was applied to outcome assessors.\n\nResults: Greater ICH reduction correlated with higher likelihood of achieving mRS 0 to 3, with thresholds of ≤15 mL end-of-treatment ICH volume or ≥70% volume reduction. Mortality benefit was observed at ≤30 mL ICH volume or >53% reduction. Factors affecting evacuation included initial hematoma volume, hypertension history, hematoma shape, alteplase doses, protocol deviations, and catheter issues. Experienced surgeons/sites avoided poor evacuation. Analysis was intention-to-treat.\n\nInterpretation: This trial identifies ICH volume reduction thresholds linked to improved mortality and functional outcomes. Emphasizing protocol adherence, surgeon training, and technical improvements is crucial for surgical benefit realization.\n\nTrial registration: [Provide registration number]\n\nFunding: [Provide funding source]",
