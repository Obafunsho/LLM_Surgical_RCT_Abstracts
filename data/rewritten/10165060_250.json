A 250-word version\n\nTitle: A Randomised Controlled Trial Comparing Free Dermal Fat Graft and Superficial Musculoaponeurotic System Flap in Superficial Parotidectomy\n\nBackground: Parotidectomy is a standard procedure for treating benign parotid lesions but can lead to complications such as facial asymmetry and Frey’s syndrome. This study aimed to compare the functional and aesthetic outcomes of free dermal fat graft (FDFG) and superficial musculoaponeurotic system (SMAS) flap in reducing these complications.\n\nMethods: In a single-centre, prospective randomised controlled trial, 78 adult patients undergoing superficial conservative parotidectomy for benign indications were randomised into two groups using a closed envelope method. One group received FDFG, and the other received SMAS flap. The primary outcome was the development of Frey’s syndrome, assessed at 6 months postoperatively. Randomisation was concealed, and outcome assessors were blinded.\n\nResults: Seventy-eight patients were randomised equally between February 2016 and October 2021. There was no significant difference in the development of Frey’s syndrome between the FDFG and SMAS groups. Aesthetic satisfaction was high in both groups, with no poor results reported. Over correction was more common in the FDFG group, while under correction was more frequent in the SMAS group. No significant differences were found in demographic data, co-morbidities, parotid pathologies, specimen volumes, total operating time, or postoperative complications.\n\nInterpretation: Both FDFG and SMAS flap are effective in improving functional and aesthetic outcomes post-parotidectomy. Selection of the procedure can be based on patient and tumour characteristics. Trial registration: NCT05452837. Funding: Not specified.",
