Eligibility criteria included a tumor edge to articular surface distance of 10 to 15 mm, good chemotherapy response, no pathologic fracture, and no major neurovascular involvement. The intervention involved transepiphysis tumor resection with navigation-assisted microwave ablation, followed by reconstruction using allograft and a vascularized fibula flap. Patients were followed for a minimum of 37 months (mean, 48 months; range 37–62 months). The primary outcome was local tumor control, assessed over the follow-up period. \n\nResults: No local recurrences were observed. Major complications included osteonecrosis of part of the epiphysis in two patients and deep infection in one. Functional outcomes, measured by the Musculoskeletal Tumor Society score, ranged from 26 to 30, with a mean of 29. \n\nInterpretation: Navigated resection with adjuvant microwave ablation appears to provide adequate local tumor control in selected patients, facilitating joint-sparing surgery. Further studies with larger sample sizes and longer follow-up are needed to confirm these findings. \n\nTrial registration: Not applicable. \n\nFunding: Not specified.",
