A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Surgical Ventricular Reconstruction in Ischemic Heart Failure\n\nBackground: This study investigates whether postoperative reduction in end-systolic volume affects survival in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) alone versus CABG plus surgical ventricular reconstruction (SVR).\n\nMethods: In this randomised controlled trial, 1000 patients with ischemic heart failure were randomised to receive either CABG alone or CABG plus SVR. The primary outcome was survival, assessed at 4 months postoperatively. Randomisation was conducted using a computer-generated sequence, with allocation concealment ensured. Blinding was not feasible due to the surgical nature of the interventions. Of the 1000 patients, 555 underwent surgery and had paired imaging assessments at baseline and 4 months. The analysis followed a per-protocol approach.\n\nResults: SVR resulted in improved survival compared to CABG alone when the postoperative end-systolic volume index was ≤70 mL/m². In contrast, patients with a postoperative volume index >70 mL/m² had better outcomes with CABG alone. A reduction in the end-systolic volume index of ≥30% was infrequent in both groups and did not confer a significant survival benefit with SVR. No significant adverse events were reported in either group.\n\nInterpretation: SVR provides a survival benefit over CABG alone when achieving a postoperative end-systolic volume index of ≤70 mL/m². Extensive ventricular remodeling at baseline may hinder the ability of SVR to achieve sufficient volume reduction and clinical benefit. Trial registration: [Trial registration number]. Funding: [Source of funding]. This study highlights the importance of patient selection in optimizing outcomes for surgical interventions in ischemic heart failure.",
