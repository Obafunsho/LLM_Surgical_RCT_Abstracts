A 300-word version\n\nTitle: A Randomised Controlled Trial of Decision Aids for Hip and Knee Osteoarthritis\n\nBackground: This study evaluated the comparative effectiveness of two decision aids (DAs) in facilitating informed patient-centered decisions for patients with hip or knee osteoarthritis considering surgery.\n\nMethods: A multisite 2 × 2 factorial randomised trial was conducted at three sites from April 2016 to December 2017. A total of 1,636 patients were randomised to receive either a long, detailed DA or a short, interactive DA. Eight surgeons were randomly assigned to receive a patient preference report or administer usual care. The primary outcome was the rate of informed patient-centered decisions, assessed before and after the surgeon visit. Randomisation was stratified by site, and allocation was concealed. Participants and clinicians were not blinded, but the statistician was.\n\nResults: Of the 1,636 patients, 1,220 pre-visit and 967 post-visit surveys were returned. Participants had a mean age of 65 years, with 57% female and 67% having knee osteoarthritis. The informed decision rate was 67.2%, with no significant difference between DA groups (p = 0.97) or surgeon groups (p = 0.23). Knowledge scores were significantly higher in the short-DA group (mean difference = 9%; p < 0.001). Surgery was performed in 60.5% of cases within six months, with no significant difference by group. Surgeons reported high satisfaction and normal visit duration. No adverse events were reported.\n\nInterpretation: The short DA was more effective in improving knowledge, while both DAs were comparable in other outcomes. The trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02729831). Funding sources were not specified. This study provides evidence that both DAs can effectively support informed decision-making in elective surgery for osteoarthritis.",
