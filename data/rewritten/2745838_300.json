Catheters were placed using an ultrasound-guided, in-plane posterior approach, and all participants received an initial ropivacaine bolus. The primary outcome was average pain on postoperative day (POD) 1, assessed on a 0–10 scale. Secondary outcomes included least and worst pain scores, oral opioid requirements, sleep disturbances, patient satisfaction, and incidence of complications. Randomisation was computer-generated, with allocation concealment. Blinding was maintained for patients, clinicians, and outcome assessors.\n\nResults: Of the 32 randomised, 30 were analysed per protocol (15 in each group). Continuous ropivacaine infusion resulted in a significant reduction in average pain on POD 1 (median [10th–90th percentile]: 0.0 [0.0–5.0] vs. 3.0 [0.0–6.0]; P < 0.001). Median oral opioid consumption was lower in the ropivacaine group on POD 1 and 2 (P = 0.002). Participants in the ropivacaine group experienced fewer sleep disturbances (P = 0.005) and reported higher satisfaction with analgesia (P < 0.001). No significant adverse events were observed.\n\nInterpretation: The continuous posterior interscalene block provides enhanced analgesia, reduces opioid consumption, and improves sleep quality and patient satisfaction compared to a single-injection block.
