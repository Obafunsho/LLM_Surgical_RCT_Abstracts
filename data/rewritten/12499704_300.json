A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial on the Effect of Intravenous Lignocaine Infusion on Intraoperative Desflurane Requirements\n\nBackground: This randomised controlled trial aimed to evaluate the effect of intravenous (IV) lignocaine infusion on the intraoperative end-tidal desflurane (Et-Des) concentration required to maintain Bispectral Index Scale (BIS) values between 40 and 60 during laparoscopic surgery.\n\nMethods: Conducted at Hospital Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia, 48 patients aged 18-75 years, scheduled for laparoscopic cholecystectomy, appendicectomy, or ovarian cystectomy, were randomised 1:1 to receive either a bolus of 1.5 mg/kg of 2% lignocaine hydrochloride followed by an infusion of 1 mg/kg/h (Group A) or an equal volume of normal saline (Group B). Randomisation was computer-generated with allocation concealment using sealed envelopes. Both patients and clinicians were blinded. The primary outcome was the Et-Des concentration, measured every 10 minutes until skin closure.\n\nResults: Forty-seven patients were analysed (23 in Group A, 24 in Group B) using an intention-to-treat approach. Group A had a significantly lower Et-Des concentration (4.3% ± 0.45%) compared to Group B (5.3% ± 0.56%, p < 0.001). The cost of desflurane was significantly reduced in Group A (Ringgit Malaysia: 35.79 ± 7.43) compared to Group B (Ringgit Malaysia: 46.37 ± 9.75, p < 0.001). Heart rate and mean arterial pressure showed no significant differences between groups. One patient in Group A experienced fast atrial fibrillation postoperatively, which resolved with treatment.\n\nInterpretation: IV lignocaine infusion effectively reduces Et-Des concentration and cost without compromising hemodynamic stability in laparoscopic surgery. This suggests its feasibility as an adjunct to anesthesia. Trial registration: NCT06064331. Funding: Supported by Azlina Masdar.",
