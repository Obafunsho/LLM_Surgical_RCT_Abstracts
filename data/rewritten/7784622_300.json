A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Adjuvant αDC1 Vaccination with Chemokine Modulation after CRS/HIPEC\n\nBackground: Peritoneal metastases have a poor prognosis with standard chemotherapy. This study evaluates the safety and efficacy of adjuvant αDC1 vaccination with chemokine modulation (CKM) following cytoreductive surgery and hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (CRS/HIPEC).\n\nMethods: This single-institution phase II trial enrolled patients with appendiceal cancer, colorectal cancer, or peritoneal mesothelioma at the University of Pittsburgh. Eligibility included histologically proven peritoneal metastases and the ability to undergo plasmapheresis. Participants received intranodal and intradermal injections of autologous tumor-loaded αDC1 vaccine and CKM, consisting of celecoxib, interferon (IFN)-α, and rintatolimod. The primary outcome was progression-free survival (PFS), measured over a median follow-up period. Randomisation and blinding were not applicable. The trial was registered under NCT02151448.\n\nResults: Forty-six patients were analysed, with 24 appendiceal, 20 colorectal, and 2 mesothelioma cases. DC maturation was successful in 97% of cases, but only 17% received the target αDC1 dose due to challenges in tumor cell recovery. Median PFS for appendiceal cancer was 50.4, 34.2, and 8.9 months for grades 1, 2, and 3, respectively, and 20.5 and 8.9 months for moderately and poorly differentiated colorectal tumors. The regimen was well tolerated, with common adverse events being mild flu-like symptoms. Six patients experienced grades 3–5 adverse events, including lymphocyte count decrease and gastrointestinal bleed.\n\nInterpretation: The αDC1 vaccine and CKM are well tolerated but did not meet predefined PFS improvement thresholds. The mucinous nature of peritoneal metastases limits the feasibility of obtaining adequate autologous tumor cells. The study highlights the need for alternative strategies in DC therapy for gastrointestinal malignancies. Funding was provided by institutional sources.",
