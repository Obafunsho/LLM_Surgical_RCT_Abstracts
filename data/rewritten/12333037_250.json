A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial on the Impact of Mild Renal Dysfunction in CABG Patients\n\nBackground: Renal dysfunction is a common risk factor in coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) patients. This study aimed to evaluate the prognosis and mid-term outcomes in CABG patients with mild renal dysfunction.\n\nMethods: This randomised controlled trial was conducted at Nanjing First Hospital from July 2020 to December 2022. Patients undergoing isolated CABG were divided into normal renal function (eGFR ≥ 90 mL/min/1.73 m²) and mild renal dysfunction (eGFR: 60–89 mL/min/1.73 m²) groups. Propensity score matching was used to balance differences. The primary outcome was acute kidney injury (AKI) within 7 days post-surgery. Secondary outcomes included perioperative mortality and major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events (MACCE).\n\nResults: A total of 1,097 patients were enrolled, with 416 (33.3%) having mild renal dysfunction. After matching, 379 pairs were analysed. Patients with mild renal dysfunction had a higher incidence of AKI (26.1% vs. 18.7%, p = 0.015) but no significant difference in perioperative mortality (1.3% vs. 1.3%, p = 1.00). At 3-year follow-up, no significant differences were observed in all-cause mortality (6.3% vs. 4.8%, log-rank p = 0.33) and MACCE rates (10.2% vs. 7.6%, log-rank p = 0.19).\n\nInterpretation: Preoperative mild renal dysfunction is associated with increased postoperative AKI risk in CABG patients, but not with perioperative mortality or mid-term outcomes.
