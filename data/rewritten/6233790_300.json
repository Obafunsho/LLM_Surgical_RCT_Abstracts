A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of VTE Prophylaxis in Korean Patients Undergoing Gastrectomy\n\nBackground: Thromboprophylaxis is recommended for patients with gastric adenocarcinoma, but its use is less common in Asian countries due to a perceived lower incidence of VTE.\n\nMethods: The PROTECTOR trial was a randomised controlled trial conducted at Seoul St Mary’s Hospital, South Korea, from August 1, 2011, to March 31, 2015. Patients with histologically confirmed gastric adenocarcinoma were randomised to receive either intermittent pneumatic compression (IPC) alone or IPC plus low-molecular-weight (LMW) heparin sodium. Randomisation was performed using a computer-generated sequence with allocation concealment. The primary outcome was the incidence of VTE within the postoperative period. Secondary outcomes included postoperative complications related to VTE prophylaxis. Blinding was not applied to patients, clinicians, or outcome assessors.\n\nResults: A total of 682 patients were randomised, with 341 in each group. The analysis included 666 patients, using both intention-to-treat and per-protocol approaches. The overall incidence of VTE was 2.1%. VTE incidence was significantly higher in the IPC-only group (3.6%; 95% CI, 2.05%-6.14%) compared to the IPC+LMW heparin group (0.6%; 95% CI, 0.17%-2.18%; P = .008). Among the 14 patients with VTE, 13 were asymptomatic with deep vein thrombosis, and 1 had symptomatic pulmonary thromboembolism. Bleeding complications were more frequent in the IPC+LMW heparin group (9.1%) compared to the IPC-only group (1.2%; P < .001). No VTE-associated mortality was observed.\n\nInterpretation: IPC alone is less effective than IPC+LMW heparin in preventing postoperative VTE, but LMW heparin increases bleeding risk. Further research is needed to identify patients at high risk for VTE.\n\nTrial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01448746\n\nFunding: Not specified.",
