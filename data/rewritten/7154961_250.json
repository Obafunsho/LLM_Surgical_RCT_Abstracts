A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Perioperative Cognitive Training in Older Cardiac Surgery Patients\n\nBackground: Postoperative delirium and cognitive dysfunction (POCD) are prevalent after cardiac surgery, increasing complications and mortality. This study evaluates the feasibility and potential efficacy of a perioperative cognitive training (CT) program to reduce these conditions.\n\nMethods: This single-center randomised controlled trial included 45 adults aged 60–90 undergoing cardiac surgery at least 10 days post-enrollment. Participants were randomised 1:1 to either perioperative CT via a mobile device or usual care. The primary outcome was feasibility, assessed by enrollment and adherence. Secondary outcomes were postoperative delirium and POCD, measured using the Confusion Assessment Method and Montreal Cognitive Assessment. Patient satisfaction was evaluated postoperatively. Randomisation was computer-generated, with allocation concealment via sealed envelopes. Blinding was not applied.\n\nResults: Sixty-five percent of eligible patients were enrolled. Median adherence was 39% preoperatively, 6% immediately postoperatively, and 19% post-discharge. The incidence of delirium was 25% in the CT group versus 15% in controls (P = .69), and POCD was 53% versus 37% (P = .33). CT participants reported higher satisfaction with memory and thinking improvements. No adverse events were reported.\n\nInterpretation: The CT program is a promising target for cognitive prehabilitation in older cardiac surgery patients. Future trials should enhance program functionality and adherence. Further research is needed to confirm efficacy in reducing postoperative delirium and POCD.\n\nTrial registration: [Trial registration number]\n\nFunding: [Source of funding]",
