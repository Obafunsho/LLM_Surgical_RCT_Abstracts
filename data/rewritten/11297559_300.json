The primary outcome was mortality, measured over the postoperative period. Randomisation was achieved using a computer-generated sequence, with allocation concealment ensured by sealed envelopes. Blinding was not implemented. The study period spanned from November 2018 to February 2023.\n\nResults: The groups were demographically similar. CPB and aortic cross-clamp times were significantly longer in the HCPB group (p=0.008 and p=0.009, respectively). Seven deaths occurred, with a mortality rate of 7% (5 in HCPB, 2 in NCPB; p=0.25). No significant differences were found in mortality, morbidity, or postoperative complications between groups. Adverse events included heart failure, septic shock, and pulmonary hemorrhage, with no significant difference in frequency or severity between groups.\n\nInterpretation: NCPB is a safe alternative to HCPB in pediatric TOF repair, though not significantly more effective. The findings suggest that NCPB can be safely adopted in similar settings, but further research is needed to confirm these results and explore its applicability to other congenital heart diseases.\n\nTrial registration: Not provided.\n\nFunding: Not specified.",
