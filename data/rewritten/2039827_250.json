Eligibility included histologically confirmed adenocarcinoma within 15 cm of the anal sphincter. Oxaliplatin was administered on days 1 and 29 with a fixed capecitabine dose of 1000 mg/m² twice daily on days 1–14 and 25–38, alongside 50.4 Gy radiotherapy. Surgery followed 6–8 weeks post-treatment. The primary outcome was the R0 resection rate, assessed in phase II. Randomisation and blinding details were not applicable.\n\nResults: Between June 2003 and December 2004, 22 patients were enrolled, with 21 evaluable for outcomes. The MTD of oxaliplatin was 85 mg/m². In phase II, 17/21 patients achieved R0 resection (81%, 95% CI 58–95%), with 7/21 downstaged to T0-2 and 2/21 achieving pCR. Grade III diarrhea occurred in 18% of patients.\n\nInterpretation: Capox-RT demonstrated an acceptable toxicity profile and high R0 resection rate in locally advanced rectal cancer, though the pCR rate was low. Further studies are needed to confirm these findings.\n\nTrial registration: Not provided.\n\nFunding: Not specified.",
