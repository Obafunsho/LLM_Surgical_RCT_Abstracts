This study aimed to assess whether a three-dimensional (3D) simulation improves patients' confidence in understanding their likely aesthetic outcome after surgery.\n\nMethods: This randomised controlled trial was conducted at the Royal Marsden Sutton site, involving 117 women eligible for unilateral BCT. Participants were randomised into three groups: standard care (verbal description alone), viewing two-dimensional (2D) photographs, or viewing a 3D simulation. The primary outcome was the median score on a visual analogue scale (VAS) assessing confidence in knowing the likely aesthetic outcome, measured before surgery. Randomisation was stratified by BMI, axillary lymph node dissection intention, and operation type, with allocation concealment ensured by a central computer program. Blinding was applied to outcome assessors.\n\nResults: Between May 2017 and October 2019, 41 participants were randomised to the control group, 39 to the 2D-photograph group, and 37 to the 3D simulation group. The median VAS scores were 5.2 (i.q.r. 2.6–7.8) for the control, 8.0 (i.q.r. 5.7–8.7) for 2D photography, and 8.9 (i.q.r. 8.2–9.5) for 3D simulation, with significant differences between groups (P < 0.010). No adverse events were reported.\n\nInterpretation: Viewing a 3D simulation significantly increased preoperative confidence compared to standard care and 2D photographs. The impact on long-term satisfaction remains to be determined. Trial registration: NCT03250260.

Post-hoc pairwise comparisons showed significant differences between 3D simulation and both standard care and 2D photographs (P < 0.010 and P = 0.012, respectively).
