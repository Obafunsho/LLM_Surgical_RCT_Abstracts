A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Tranexamic Acid in Major Abdominal Surgery\n\nBackground: Intra- and postoperative hemorrhage in major abdominal surgery often necessitates transfusion of packed red blood cells (PRBCs), posing health risks and socioeconomic burdens. Tranexamic acid (TXA) has shown efficacy in reducing hemorrhage in other surgical fields but lacks evidence in abdominal surgery.\n\nMethods: This multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomised superiority trial involves 850 patients aged 18 years or older undergoing elective esophagectomy, gastrectomy, colectomy, rectal resection, pancreatic resection, or hepatectomy across eleven academic hospitals in Germany. Participants are randomised 1:1 to receive either TXA (1000 mg bolus before incision, 125 mg/h until closure) or placebo. The primary outcome is the need for transfusion of at least one unit of PRBCs, measured intra- or postoperatively. Randomisation is computer-generated with allocation concealment via sealed envelopes. Blinding includes patients, clinicians, and outcome assessors.\n\nResults: Recruitment began on June 17, 2024, with completion expected by November 2025. The sample size calculation assumes a 30% transfusion rate in the control group and a 33% risk reduction with TXA, requiring 425 patients per group.\n\nInterpretation: Positive results would support routine TXA use in major abdominal surgery, potentially reducing anemia and transfusion-related complications. Adverse events will be monitored, with trial registration EU CT Nr: 2023–509970-43–01, NCT06414031. Funding is provided by institutional grants.",
