A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Accelerometry-Based Motion Detectors in Brachial Plexus Reconstruction\n\nBackground: Accurate assessment of functional outcomes in brachial plexus reconstruction is crucial. Traditional clinician-elicited evaluations may not reflect real-world arm use. This study evaluates accelerometry-based motion detectors for assessing functional outcomes post-nerve transfer.\n\nMethods: This randomised controlled trial included five male patients, aged 41 years on average, who underwent nerve transfer for brachial plexus injury. Participants wore bilateral accelerometry-based motion detectors for 7 days. The primary outcome was the time of use ratio (VT) and magnitude ratio (VM) of the affected arm compared to the unaffected arm. Range-of-motion evaluations and patient-reported outcome surveys were also conducted. Randomisation and allocation concealment methods were not specified. Blinding details were not provided.\n\nResults: The VT for the affected side compared to the unaffected side was 0.73 (±0.27), and the VM was 0.63 (±0.59). VT strongly correlated with shoulder flexion (0.97, P = .008) and shoulder abduction (0.99, P = .002). No adverse events were reported.\n\nInterpretation: Accelerometry-based activity monitors effectively assess real-world functional outcomes after brachial plexus reconstruction. Patients utilize their affected limbs significantly in daily activities, highlighting the importance of shoulder function recovery. Trial registration and funding details were not provided.",
