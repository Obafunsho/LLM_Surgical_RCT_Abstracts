This study aimed to evaluate whether negative-pressure wound therapy (NPWT) improves wound healing compared with conventional wound dressing.\n\nMethods: This single-centre, open-label, parallel, individually randomised controlled trial was conducted at IRCCS Humanitas Research Hospital, Milan, Italy. Patients scheduled for elective stoma-reversal surgery were randomised (1:1) to receive NPWT or conventional wound dressing. The primary outcome was the rate of wound complications and SSIs within 30 days post-surgery. Secondary outcomes included postoperative wound pain, wound healing rate, and aesthetic satisfaction. Randomisation was achieved using a computer-generated sequence with allocation concealment. The study was unblinded.\n\nResults: Between June 2019 and January 2021, 100 patients were randomised: 50 to NPWT (49 analysed) and 50 to control (45 analysed). No significant difference was found in wound-complication rate (10% NPWT vs. 16% control; odds ratio 0.61, 95% CI 0.18 to 2.10, P = 0.542) and SSI rate (8% NPWT vs. 7% control; odds ratio 1.24, 95% CI 0.26 to 5.99, P = 1.000). NPWT showed less pain, higher aesthetic satisfaction (P < 0.0001), and a higher proportion of wound healing (92% vs. 78%; P = 0.081). No adverse events were reported.\n\nInterpretation: NPWT does not reduce the incidence of SSIs after stoma-reversal surgery compared with conventional wound dressing. However, NPWT improved the healing of uninfected wounds, reduced wound pain, and led to better aesthetic outcomes. These findings suggest that NPWT may be beneficial in enhancing patient satisfaction and recovery. Registration: NCT037812016. Funding: Smith&Nephew S.R.L.",
