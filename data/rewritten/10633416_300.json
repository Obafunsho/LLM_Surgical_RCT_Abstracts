A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Laser Epilation in Pilonidal Disease: A Randomised Controlled Trial\n\nBackground: Recurrence of pilonidal disease remains a significant challenge in its management.\n\nMethods: This single-institution, randomised clinical trial was conducted at a tertiary children's hospital from September 2017 to September 2022. Participants aged 11 to 21 years with pilonidal disease were randomised to receive either laser epilation (LE) with standard care or standard care alone. The primary outcome was the recurrence rate of pilonidal disease at 1 year. Secondary outcomes included disability days, health-related quality of life (HRQOL), health care satisfaction, disease-related attitudes, perceived stigma, and rates of procedures, surgical excisions, and postoperative complications. Randomisation was performed using a computer-generated sequence, and allocation was concealed. Blinding was not specified.\n\nResults: A total of 302 participants were randomised: 151 to the LE group and 151 to the standard care group. One-year follow-up data were available for 96 patients in the LE group and 134 in the standard care group. The recurrence rate was significantly lower in the LE group (−23.2%; 95% CI, −33.2 to −13.1; P < .001). No significant differences were observed in secondary outcomes, including disability days, HRQOL, health care satisfaction, or perceived stigma. The LE group had higher Child Attitude Toward Illness Scores at 6 months (median [IQR], 3.8 [3.4-4.2] vs 3.6 [3.2-4.1]; P = .01). No differences were found in disease-related health care utilization, procedures, or postoperative complications. Adverse events were not reported.\n\nInterpretation: LE as an adjunct to standard care significantly reduces 1-year recurrence rates of pilonidal disease compared to standard care alone. LE is safe and well tolerated, suggesting it should be considered a standard treatment modality.\n\nTrial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03276065\n\nFunding: Not specified.",
