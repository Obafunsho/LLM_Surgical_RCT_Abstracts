Eligibility criteria included good performance status and absence of extrahepatic disease. QoL was evaluated using the EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaire at baseline and up to 3 years post-transplantation. The primary outcome was OS at 2 years, with secondary outcomes including disease-free survival and QoL. No randomisation or blinding was employed.\n\nResults: All 23 patients received LT. At 3 months post-LT, patients reported reduced QoL, physical function, and increased dyspnoea. By 6 months, these scores returned to baseline. At 3 years, all scores were comparable to baseline. Patients with high baseline scores for fatigue, pain, and appetite loss had reduced 3-year OS. Seven patients died within 3 years, with higher baseline symptom scores correlating with lower OS. The mean difference in fatigue scores between those who survived and those who did not was 18.2 (95% CI 2.1 to 34.3; p = 0.033).\n\nInterpretation: LT for non-resectable CRLM resulted in good long-term QoL. High baseline symptom scores were associated with reduced 3-year OS. The study was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT01311453) and funded by institutional sources. The findings suggest that baseline symptom scores could be considered in patient selection for LT.",
