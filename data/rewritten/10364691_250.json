A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Hughes Closure vs. Standard Mass Closure in Colorectal Cancer Surgery\n\nBackground: Incisional hernias are a common complication post-abdominal surgery, often requiring further intervention. This trial assessed the effect of Hughes closure on incisional hernia incidence following colorectal cancer surgery.\n\nMethods: This pragmatic multicentre single-blind RCT was conducted in 28 UK hospitals. Patients undergoing midline incision for colorectal cancer were randomised to Hughes closure (double far–near–near–far sutures with conventional mass closure) or standard closure. The primary outcome was the incidence of incisional hernia at 1 year, assessed by clinical examination. Randomisation was performed in the operating theatre using a 1:1 computerized adaptive system, with allocation concealment by Sealed Envelope. Patients and outcome assessors were blinded. Sample size calculation aimed for 800 patients, anticipating 20% loss to follow-up.\n\nResults: From August 2014 to February 2018, 802 patients were randomised (401 per group). At 1 year, 672 patients were analysed (339 Hughes, 333 standard) using intention-to-treat. Incisional hernia occurred in 14.8% of Hughes and 17.1% of standard groups (OR 0.84, 95% CI 0.55 to 1.27; P = 0.402). At 2 years, rates were 28.7% and 31.8%, respectively (OR 0.86, 0.59 to 1.25; P = 0.429). Surgical-site infections were higher in the Hughes group (13.2% vs. 7.7%; OR 1.82, 1.14 to 2.91; P = 0.011).\n\nInterpretation: No significant difference in incisional hernia incidence was found between Hughes and standard closure. The trial is registered under ISRCTN25616490. Funding was provided by the National Institute for Health Research.",
