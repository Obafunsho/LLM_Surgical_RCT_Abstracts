This study aims to review our institutional experience with sutureless aortic valve replacement (SU-AVR) using the Perceval valve.\n\nMethods: We conducted a retrospective analysis of 200 consecutive patients who underwent SU-AVR at a single center between December 2019 and February 2023. Participants included patients with moderate-to-severe aortic valve disease, with a mean age of 69.3 years and a mean logistic EuroSCORE-II of 5.2%. The primary outcome was mortality at various time points, and secondary outcomes included postoperative complications. The study was performed in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, with ethical approval obtained from the Ethics Committee of the University Hospital of Essen, Germany.\n\nResults: An isolated SU-AVR was performed in 85 patients, while 75 underwent concomitant CABG and 40 had multivalve procedures. The mean cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) and cross-clamp (CC) times were 82.1 and 55.5 minutes, respectively. In-hospital, 30-day, 6-month, and 1-year mortality rates were 4.5%, 6.5%, 7.5%, and 8.2%, respectively. The postoperative transvalvular mean pressure gradient was 6.3 mmHg and remained stable over the follow-up period. No paravalvular leakage was reported, and the incidence of stroke was 0.5%. Adverse events included re-exploration for bleeding in 7% of patients and permanent pacemaker implantation in 4%.\n\nInterpretation: Sutureless aortic valve prostheses facilitate minimally invasive surgery with favorable hemodynamic performance and reduced CC and CPB times. The approach is safe and durable for surgical aortic valve replacement. Further investigation with larger multicenter studies is necessary to confirm long-term outcomes.",
