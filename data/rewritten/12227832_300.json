A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Tranexamic Acid in Reducing Blood Loss During Nephrectomy for Wilms Tumor in Children\n\nBackground: Nephrectomy for Wilms tumor is associated with significant intraoperative blood loss. This study investigates the efficacy of tranexamic acid (TXA) in reducing blood loss during this procedure in children.\n\nMethods: This prospective, randomised controlled trial was conducted at a tertiary healthcare center in India. Sixty children under 10 years with Wilms tumor scheduled for elective nephrectomy were randomised into two groups: TXA group (n=30) received 50 mg/kg TXA intravenously, followed by 5 mg/kg/h infusion; NS group (n=30) received an equivalent volume of normal saline. Randomisation was performed using a computer-generated sequence with allocation concealment via sealed envelopes. Both patients and outcome assessors were blinded. The primary outcome was intraoperative blood loss, measured during surgery. Secondary outcomes included PRBC transfusion volume, intraoperative hemodynamic parameters, and serum lactate levels.\n\nResults: The TXA group had significantly lower intraoperative blood loss (216.33 mL vs 306.33 mL; p=0.001) and PRBC transfusion volume (167.0 mL vs 199.8 mL; p=0.045). Serum lactate levels were lower in the TXA group (1.82 mmol/L vs 2.63 mmol/L; p=0.001). Mean arterial blood pressure and heart rate were similar in both groups. No adverse events were reported in either group during the intraoperative or immediate postoperative period.\n\nInterpretation: TXA significantly reduces intraoperative blood loss and transfusion requirements in children undergoing nephrectomy for Wilms tumor without increasing adverse events. These findings support the inclusion of TXA in surgical bleeding prophylaxis for this patient population. Trial registration: Clinical Trial Registry of India (No. 2024/09/073921).
