A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of the Dor Procedure with Intraoperative Substrate Mapping for Refractory Ventricular Tachycardia\n\nBackground: The study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of the Dor procedure combined with intraoperative substrate mapping and ablation in patients with left ventricular (LV) aneurysms and refractory ventricular tachycardia (VT).\n\nMethods: This randomised controlled trial was conducted at a tertiary care center. Eligible participants were patients with drug-resistant recurrent VT and LV aneurysms. Participants were randomised to receive either the Dor procedure with intraoperative substrate mapping and ablation or standard care. The primary outcome was VT recurrence, measured over a 28-month follow-up period. Randomisation was performed using a computer-generated sequence, and allocation was concealed using sealed envelopes. Blinding was not feasible due to the nature of the intervention.\n\nResults: A total of 2 participants were randomised, with 1 in each group. Both participants were analysed per protocol. The intervention group showed no VT recurrence at 28 months, while the control group experienced VT recurrence. No major complications were reported in either group.\n\nInterpretation: The Dor procedure combined with intraoperative substrate mapping and ablation may reduce VT recurrence in patients with LV aneurysms. Further studies with larger sample sizes are needed to confirm these findings.\n\nTrial registration: Not provided.\n\nFunding: Not reported.",
