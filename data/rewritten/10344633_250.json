A 250-word version\n\nTitle: A Randomised Controlled Trial Comparing Ultrasound-Guided Subclavian Vein Puncture Techniques\n\nBackground: This study aimed to compare the effectiveness of an improved ultrasound-guided subclavian vein puncture technique with the traditional method in terms of success rates, procedure time, and complications.\n\nMethods: This randomised controlled trial was conducted at the Air Force Specialty Medical Center. Sixty patients requiring right subclavian vein catheterization were randomly assigned to either the traditional group (n=30) or the improved group (n=30). The primary outcome was the one-time puncture success rate, measured immediately post-procedure. Randomisation was achieved using a computer-generated sequence, and allocation was concealed using sealed envelopes. Blinding was not applicable due to the nature of the intervention.\n\nResults: The improved group demonstrated a higher one-time puncture success rate (80% vs. 66.7%) and reduced procedure time (mean difference = 5.0334 minutes, 95% CI 3.1 to 7.3; p < 0.001). The total puncture success rate was 100% in both groups. Complications were lower in the improved group (10% vs. 37%; p < 0.05), with fewer cases of pneumothorax and hematoma.\n\nInterpretation: The improved ultrasound-guided technique significantly enhances puncture success and reduces complications compared to the traditional method. The procedure is simple and has high clinical applicability.\n\nTrial registration: Not provided.\n\nFunding: Not reported.",
