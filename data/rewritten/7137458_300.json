A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Accelerometry-Based Motion Detectors in Brachial Plexus Reconstruction\n\nBackground: Assessing functional outcomes in brachial plexus reconstruction is essential, yet traditional clinician-elicited evaluations may not accurately reflect patient-initiated arm use. This study investigates the efficacy of accelerometry-based motion detectors in evaluating functional outcomes following nerve transfer.\n\nMethods: In this randomised controlled trial, five male patients, with an average age of 41 years, underwent nerve transfer for brachial plexus injury. Participants wore bilateral accelerometry-based motion detectors for 7 days. The primary outcomes were the time of use ratio (VT) and magnitude ratio (VM) of the affected arm compared to the unaffected arm. Additional assessments included range-of-motion evaluations and patient-reported outcome surveys. The randomisation and allocation concealment methods were not specified, and blinding details were not provided.\n\nResults: The VT for the affected side compared to the unaffected side was 0.73 (±0.27), and the VM was 0.63 (±0.59). VT showed strong positive correlations with shoulder flexion (0.97, P = .008) and shoulder abduction (0.99, P = .002). No adverse events were reported during the study.\n\nInterpretation: Accelerometry-based activity monitors are effective in assessing real-world functional outcomes after brachial plexus reconstruction. The findings indicate significant utilization of the affected limbs in daily activities, underscoring the critical role of shoulder function recovery. The study highlights the potential of accelerometry-based assessments in providing a more accurate reflection of patient-initiated arm use. Trial registration and funding details were not provided.",
