This study evaluates the effect of intraarticular fibrinogen on bleeding and transfusion requirements post-TKA.\n\nMethods: In a double-blind, randomised controlled trial, 200 patients undergoing TKA for osteoarthritis were randomised to receive either intraarticular fibrinogen or no treatment before tourniquet release. The primary outcome was postoperative blood loss, measured by drain output and hemoglobin drop at Day 2. Secondary outcomes included transfusion requirements, early clinical results, and complications. Randomisation was computer-generated, and allocation was concealed. Patients, clinicians, and outcome assessors were blinded. Recruitment occurred between January 2020 and June 2021.\n\nResults: 100 patients were randomised to each group. Analysis was intention-to-treat. No significant difference in calculated blood loss was observed between groups. Mean drain output was 780 ± 378 mL in the fibrinogen group and 673 ± 301 mL in the control group (p = 0.029). Hemoglobin drop was 3.47 ± 1.53 g/L in the fibrinogen group and 3.84 ± 1.24 g/L in the control group (p = 0.051). No differences were found in transfusions, early ROM, pain scores, or complications. Adverse events were similar between groups.\n\nInterpretation: Intraarticular fibrinogen did not significantly reduce blood loss or transfusions in primary TKA for osteoarthritis. Its routine use is not justified given the lack of benefits and additional costs.\n\nTrial registration: [Trial registration number]\n\nFunding: [Source of funding]",
