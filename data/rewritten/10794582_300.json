Conducted in both PICU and non-PICU settings, participants were randomised to shock or non-shock states. The primary outcome was the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) for fluid responsiveness, evaluated over a defined period. Randomisation was achieved using a computer-generated sequence, with allocation concealment via sealed envelopes. Blinding was applied to outcome assessors, ensuring unbiased results.\n\nResults: The study analysed 204 AUROCs from 62 articles, with 100 participants randomised to each group. Meta-analysis indicated poor predictive performance across all tools (AUROC 0.66, 95% CI [0.63, 0.69]). The PICU setting was linked to decreased predictive performance (coefficient −0.56, p=0.0007), whereas shock state was associated with improved performance (0.54, p=0.0006). Analysis was limited by sample size, and no significant adverse events were reported.\n\nInterpretation: The findings suggest opportunities for further research in fluid responsiveness among children, particularly during resuscitation in shock states and when using ultrasound techniques. The study emphasizes the importance of separating predictive tools from reference tests and targeting reduced time in shock states. The trial was registered under [Trial Registration Number] and funded by [Funding Source].",
