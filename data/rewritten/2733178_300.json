A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Morphine in Preterm Neonates Undergoing Endotracheal Tube Suctioning\n\nBackground: The effect of plasma morphine concentrations on neonatal responses to endotracheal tube (ETT) suctioning in preterm neonates is not well understood.\n\nMethods: This multicenter, double-blind, randomised controlled trial involved 898 ventilated preterm neonates from 16 centers, randomly assigned to placebo (n=449) or morphine (n=449). Eligible participants were preterm neonates requiring mechanical ventilation. After an i.v. loading dose of 100 µg/kg, morphine infusions were administered according to postmenstrual age (PMA) for up to 14 days. Open-label morphine was available for pain or agitation. Randomisation was computer-generated, with concealed allocation. Blinding included outcome assessors, patients, and clinicians. The primary outcome was the neonatal response to ETT suctioning, assessed at 20–28 and 70–76 hours after starting the drug infusion and 10–14 hours after discontinuation.\n\nResults: Data from 875 neonates were analyzed using a non-linear mixed effects model. Morphine clearance was 50% of the mature value at 54.2 weeks PMA, increasing from 2.05 to 6.04 litre/h/70 kg between 24 and 32 weeks PMA. The volume of distribution was 190 litre/70 kg. No significant relationship was observed between morphine concentrations and heart rate changes or the Premature Infant Pain Profile. No adverse events were reported.\n\nInterpretation: Morphine does not affect the neonatal response to ETT suctioning. The maturation of morphine clearance is delayed in preterm neonates, with an increased volume of distribution compared to term neonates. Trial registration: [Trial registration number]. Funding: [Source of funding]. This study provides important insights into the pharmacokinetics of morphine in preterm neonates and its lack of effect on procedural pain response.",
