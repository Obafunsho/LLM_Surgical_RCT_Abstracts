A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial on Exercise in Abdominal Aortic Aneurysms\n\nBackground: This study investigates the impact of exercise on abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs), focusing on the balance between exercise benefits and potential risks.\n\nMethods: A randomised controlled trial was conducted with 65 patients with small AAAs, recruited from a cardiovascular clinic. Participants were randomly assigned to an exercise group (n=33) or a usual care group (n=32) using computer-generated random numbers. The exercise group participated in a supervised program of aerobic and resistance training, with each session lasting approximately one hour. The primary outcome was the change in AAA size over 12 months. Blinding was not applied to participants or clinicians, but outcome assessors were blinded. Analysis was performed on an intention-to-treat basis.\n\nResults: The exercise group showed no significant difference in AAA growth compared to the control group (mean difference = 0.2 mm/year, 95% CI -0.5 to 0.9; p=0.45). The exercise group demonstrated improved exercise capacity and ventilatory efficiency. No adverse events were reported in either group, indicating the safety of the exercise regimen.\n\nInterpretation: Light to moderate exercise is safe and beneficial for patients with small AAAs, without accelerating aneurysm growth. These findings support the inclusion of exercise in the management of AAA patients, emphasizing the importance of regular follow-up and optimal management of cardiovascular risk factors.\n\nTrial registration: N/A\n\nFunding: This study was funded by the National Institute of Health.",
