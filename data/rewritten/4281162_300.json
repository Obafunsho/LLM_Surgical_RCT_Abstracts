This study investigates the safety, feasibility, and immunogenicity of CMV pp65 mRNA-loaded autologous monocyte-derived dendritic cells (DC) as a vaccine.\n\nMethods: Conducted at Antwerp University Hospital, this randomised controlled trial involved four CMV-seronegative healthy volunteers and three allogeneic HSCT recipients. Participants received four weekly intradermal DC vaccines, prepared from a single leukapheresis. The primary outcome was the induction of CMV-specific T-cell responses, evaluated one month post-vaccination. The study was not blinded, and randomisation and allocation concealment methods were not detailed.\n\nResults: In healthy volunteers, three of four exhibited de novo CMV-specific T-cell responses without serious adverse events. Among HSCT recipients, none developed CMV disease, and one patient showed a threefold increase in CMV pp65-specific T cells. Adverse events included transient local redness and mild swelling at the injection site, with no serious events in healthy subjects. One HSCT patient developed moderate grade II GVHD, necessitating immunosuppressive treatment. The trial did not specify the number of participants randomised to each group or the analysis approach.\n\nInterpretation: The DC vaccination strategy successfully induced or expanded CMV-specific cellular responses in four of six efficacy-evaluable subjects, suggesting potential for broader application. Further research in larger cohorts is recommended. The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Antwerp University Hospital, and informed consent was obtained from all participants. Trial registration and funding information were not provided. The findings highlight the potential of DC vaccination in enhancing CMV-specific immunity in transplant settings.",
