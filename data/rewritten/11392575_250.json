This study evaluates the efficacy of nasal cannula oxygen as an adjunct to standard preoxygenation.\n\nMethods: This prospective randomized crossover trial involved 30 healthy volunteers aged 20-50 years at a tertiary care center. Participants were randomized to six preoxygenation sequences: 3-minute tidal volume breathing (TVB) and 8 vital capacity breaths (VCB) with nasal cannula oxygen at 0, 5, and 10 L/min. The primary outcome was end-tidal oxygen (ETO2) measured at the end of each preoxygenation sequence. Randomization was performed using a Latin square method, and allocation was concealed. Blinding was not applicable.\n\nResults: All 30 participants completed the study. ETO2 increased significantly with nasal cannula oxygen, with 3-minute TVB achieving higher ETO2 (91.07% at 10 L/min) compared to 8 VCB (87.87% at 10 L/min), p < 0.001. No adverse events were reported.\n\nInterpretation: Nasal cannula oxygen improves preoxygenation efficacy, with 3-minute TVB being more effective than 8 VCB. The trial was registered with CTRI (no. CTRI/2020/04/024873) and funded by institutional resources.",
