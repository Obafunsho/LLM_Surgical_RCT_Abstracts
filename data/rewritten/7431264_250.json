This study evaluates the efficacy of circumferential patellar cauterization in reducing anterior knee pain and improving functional outcomes.\n\nMethods: In this prospective, quasi-randomized trial, 78 patients (156 knees) undergoing bilateral, simultaneous TKA without patellar resurfacing were included. Each patient served as their own control, with patellar cauterization performed on the right knee. The primary outcome was the Kujala score for anterior knee pain, assessed preoperatively and at 1 month and 2 years postoperatively. Randomization was based on laterality, and blinding was not implemented.\n\nResults: At 2 years, no significant difference was found in the Kujala score between cauterized and non-cauterized knees (mean difference 0.3; 95% CI, -0.599 to 1.202; p = 0.509). Functional outcomes, including VAS pain score, Oxford knee score, and Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score, showed no significant differences. Complication rates were similar, with one deep venous thromboembolism in the cauterized group and two in the control group (odds ratio 0.49, 95% CI, 0.04-5.56; p = 0.57).\n\nInterpretation: Circumferential patellar cauterization does not reduce anterior knee pain or improve functional outcomes in non-resurfaced TKA. We do not recommend this procedure. Trial registration and funding details were not provided.",
