A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Systematic Review of Patient-Reported Outcome Measures in Differentiated Thyroid Cancer\n\nBackground: Patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) are crucial for assessing health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in patients with differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC). This study aims to systematically review and categorize all PROMs used to measure HRQOL in DTC patients.\n\nMethods: A systematic search was conducted in PubMed and EMBASE from January 1900 to September 2023. Articles were included if they focused on PROMs for DTC patients, were published in English, and provided full-text access. Data on PROMs, including development language, target population, and validation, were extracted. PROMs were categorized into five groups: universal, DTC-related, radioiodine-related, operation-related, and psychology-related.\n\nResults: A total of 330 articles met the inclusion criteria, utilizing 96 different PROMs. These PROMs were classified into universal (16/96), DTC-related (11/96), radioiodine-related (4/96), operation-related (37/96), and psychology-related (28/96) categories. Frequently used PROMs included SF-36, EORTC QLQ-C30, and THYCA-QOL, among others.\n\nInterpretation: A wide range of PROMs is available for evaluating HRQOL in DTC patients, providing a comprehensive resource for researchers. However, a detailed critical appraisal of PROMs in various clinical scenarios is necessary. The frequency of PROM usage in previous studies highlights areas of comprehensive research and gaps in HRQOL aspects, guiding future studies.\n\nTrial registration: PROSPERO CRD42024549483\n\nFunding: Supported by the Chengdu Science and Technology Bureau technology innovation research and development project (2022-YF05-01847-SN).",
