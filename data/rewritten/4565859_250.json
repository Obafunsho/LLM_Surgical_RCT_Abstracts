Eligibility required no prior neck dissection or radiotherapy. Patients received 50 µg [99m Tc]tilmanocept radiolabeled with either 0.5 mCi (same day) or 2.0 mCi (next day), followed by lymphoscintigraphy, SLNB, and elective neck dissection (END). The primary outcome was the FNR of SLNB, measured from June 2009 to November 2012.\n\nResults: Of 85 patients injected, 83 underwent SLNB/END. [99m Tc]Tilmanocept identified SLNs in 81 of 83 patients (97.6%). Among 39 patients with tumor-positive nodes, one had a false negative, yielding an FNR of 2.56% (95.03% CI 0.06–13.49; p = 0.0205). The negative predictive value (NPV) was 97.8%, and overall accuracy was 98.8%. No significant differences were observed between same-day and next-day procedures. No drug-related serious adverse events were reported.\n\nInterpretation: [99m Tc]Tilmanocept allows for high SLN identification rates and accurate prediction of nodal status in intraoral HNSCC, with low FNR and high NPV. Its use may reduce the need for extensive procedures like END. Trial registration: NCT00911326. Funding: Not specified.",
