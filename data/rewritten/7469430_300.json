  "abstract": "2. A 300-word version\n\nBackground: Functional mitral regurgitation in the setting of an enlarged heart presents surgical challenges with an annular approach. This study aims to develop a novel ex vivo model to explore sub-annular and ventricular approaches.\n\nMethods: Seven pig hearts were sourced from a local slaughterhouse. Left ventricular distension was induced by reducing the ventricular myocardium thickness by 60–65%. The hearts were distended with a 120mmHg column to confirm significant left ventricular dilatation and mitral valve tethering. These hearts were mounted into a pulsatile flow model and animated at 120mm Hg left ventricular pressure, 5L/min cardiac output at 70 beats per minute. Echocardiography was employed to assess valvular kinematics and hemodynamics.\n\nResults: Left ventricular wall thickness was reduced by 60.5±10.1% at the basal plane, 64.8±11.3% at the equatorial plane, and 64.0±11.4% at the apical plane. Ventricular volumes increased by 852.4±639.8% after LV thinning, with an 89.5±33.9% increase in sphericity index. Mitral valve systolic tenting height increased from 7.92±2.06 mm to 15.02±3.89 mm, and systolic tethering area increased from 130.7±38.2 mm² to 409.9±124.6 mm². An average mitral regurgitation fraction of 24.4±16.6% was measured. In a case study, the use of multi-modality imaging to test the efficacy of transcatheter mitral devices was confirmed.\n\nInterpretation: Ventricular wall thinning leading to passive left ventricular distension and dilatation is a reproducible ex vivo model of mitral valve tethering and functional mitral regurgitation. This model, combined with multi-modality imaging, provides a valuable simulation for testing transcatheter mitral devices, offering insights into potential therapeutic interventions.",
