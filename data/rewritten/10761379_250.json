Eligible patients had an ECOG performance status of 0–1. The intervention involved TPF chemotherapy followed by surgery if resectable, or concurrent chemoradiation if unresectable. The primary outcome was the R0 resection rate, measured post-surgery. Randomisation and blinding were not applicable. The study was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02976909).\n\nResults: Between July 2004 and February 2019, 47 patients were enrolled. Surgery was performed on 27 patients (57.4%), achieving R0 resection in 25 (53.2%). Pathologic complete response was observed in four patients (8.5%). The median follow-up was 44.8 months. The median overall survival (OS) was 41.9 months (95% CI, 18.6–65.3), and median progression-free survival (PFS) was 38.7 months (95% CI, 23.5–53.9). The 3-year OS rate was 54.4%, with 65.4% for R0 patients. No serious perioperative complications or deaths were reported.\n\nInterpretation: TPF chemotherapy followed by surgery is feasible and promising for BR-ESCC patients, improving survival outcomes. Further studies are needed to enhance R0 resection rates. The trial was funded by Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center.",
