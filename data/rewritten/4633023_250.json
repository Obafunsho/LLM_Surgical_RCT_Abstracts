This trial evaluates the effectiveness of ventral versus dorsal surgical approaches for CSM.\n\nMethods: This multicenter randomised controlled trial recruited 250 patients with CSM from 11 sites over 18 months. Participants were randomised to ventral surgery or dorsal surgery (laminectomy/fusion or laminoplasty). The primary outcome was the Short Form-36 Physical Component Summary (PCS) score at one-year follow-up. Secondary outcomes included disease-specific measures, EuroQol-5D, and health resource utilization. Randomisation was computer-generated, with allocation concealment via sealed envelopes. Blinding was applied to outcome assessors.\n\nResults: Of the 250 participants, 159 were randomised: 80 to ventral and 79 to dorsal surgery. Analysis was conducted on an intention-to-treat basis. The mean difference in SF-36 PCS scores between groups was [insert effect size], 95% CI [insert CI]; p = [insert p-value]. Adverse events occurred in [insert number] of the ventral group and [insert number] of the dorsal group.\n\nInterpretation: This trial provides evidence on the comparative effectiveness of ventral versus dorsal surgery for CSM, with implications for surgical decision-making. Trial registration: [insert registration number]. Funding: NIH (1R13AR065834-01) and PCORI (CE-1304-6173).",
