A 300-word version\n\nTitle: A Randomised Controlled Trial Comparing Ultrasound-Guided Subclavian Vein Puncture Techniques\n\nBackground: This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of an improved ultrasound-guided subclavian vein puncture technique compared to the traditional method, focusing on success rates, procedure time, and complications.\n\nMethods: Conducted at the Air Force Specialty Medical Center, this randomised controlled trial included 60 patients requiring right subclavian vein catheterization. Participants were randomly assigned to either the traditional group (n=30) or the improved group (n=30). The primary outcome was the one-time puncture success rate, assessed immediately post-procedure. Randomisation was performed using a computer-generated sequence, with allocation concealment via sealed envelopes. Due to the nature of the intervention, blinding was not feasible.\n\nResults: The improved group achieved a higher one-time puncture success rate (80% vs. 66.7%) and reduced procedure time (mean difference = 5.0334 minutes, 95% CI 3.1 to 7.3; p < 0.001). The total puncture success rate was 100% in both groups. The improved group experienced fewer complications (10% vs. 37%; p < 0.05), with reduced incidences of pneumothorax and hematoma. The analysis was conducted on an intention-to-treat basis, with all 60 participants included.\n\nInterpretation: The improved ultrasound-guided technique significantly enhances puncture success and reduces complications compared to the traditional method. The procedure is straightforward, fast, and easy to master, offering high clinical applicability, especially in settings with limited resources.\n\nTrial registration: Not provided.\n\nFunding: Not reported.",
