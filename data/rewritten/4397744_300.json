This study investigates the effect of Botulinum Toxin Type A (BtX-A) on reducing calf pain and improving range of motion (ROM) during tibial distraction osteogenesis.\n\nMethods: This double-blind, randomised controlled trial included 36 patients undergoing bilateral tibia lengthening from April 2010 to January 2011. Participants met prespecified inclusion criteria, including undergoing stature lengthening with either lengthening over a nail or lengthening and then nailing. Each patient received a 200 IU BtX-A injection in one calf muscle, with the contralateral leg receiving a saline injection as a control. Randomisation was conducted at the leg level, and allocation was concealed. The primary outcome was the difference in calf pain measured by VAS scores and ROM of the knees and ankles, assessed until the end of the consolidation phase. Minimum follow-up was 24 months, with a mean of 30 months. A priori power analysis indicated that 34 legs were needed to detect a 50% difference in treatment effect with 80% power.\n\nResults: There were no significant differences in calf pain, knee and ankle ROM, or maximal calf circumferences between the treated and control legs at any time point. The study was powered to detect only relatively large clinical effects.\n\nInterpretation: Local injection of 200 IU BtX-A does not appear to reduce calf pain or enhance ROM during tibial lengthening. Future larger trials are necessary to determine if smaller differences exist.\n\nTrial registration: Not provided.\n\nFunding: Not specified.",
