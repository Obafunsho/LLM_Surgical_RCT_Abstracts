A 300-word version\n\nTitle: A Randomised Controlled Trial of Ketamine and Nefopam for Potentiating Opioid Analgesia\n\nBackground: The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ketamine and nefopam in enhancing opioid analgesia.\n\nMethods: Conducted at [Study Setting], this randomised controlled trial included adults eligible for opioid analgesia. A total of 200 participants were randomised: 100 to receive ketamine 10 mg and 100 to receive nefopam 20 mg. Randomisation was achieved using a computer-generated sequence, with allocation concealment via sealed envelopes. Blinding was maintained for patients and outcome assessors. The primary outcome was the reduction in opioid requirement over a 24-hour period. An intention-to-treat analysis was performed.\n\nResults: Both ketamine and nefopam reduced opioid requirements by approximately 40% (mean difference = [value], 95% CI [range]; p = [value]). In the ketamine group, sedation was reported, while the nefopam group experienced tachycardia and sweating. Adverse events were mild, with 5/100 (5%) in the ketamine group and 7/100 (7%) in the nefopam group reporting side effects.\n\nInterpretation: Ketamine and nefopam are effective in potentiating opioid analgesia, each reducing opioid need by approximately 40%. The adverse effects associated with ketamine include sedation, whereas nefopam is linked to tachycardia and sweating. These side effects were mild and not serious, suggesting that either drug can be safely used to enhance opioid analgesia.\n\nTrial registration: [Trial Registration Number]\n\nFunding: This study was supported by [Funding Source].",
