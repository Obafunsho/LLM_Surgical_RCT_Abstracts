A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial Comparing Surgical Resection and Percutaneous Ethanol Injection for Small Hepatocellular Carcinoma\n\nBackground: This study aimed to compare disease recurrence and survival in patients with small hepatocellular carcinoma treated with surgical resection or percutaneous ethanol injection therapy.\n\nMethods: In this randomised controlled trial, 76 patients with one or two tumors ≤3 cm, hepatitis without cirrhosis, or Child class A or B cirrhosis without ascites or bleeding tendency were enrolled. Participants were randomly assigned to surgical resection or percutaneous ethanol injection groups. The primary outcome was disease recurrence and survival, measured over a follow-up period of 12 to 59 months. Randomisation was conducted using a computer-generated sequence, and allocation was concealed. Blinding was not applicable.\n\nResults: A total of 38 patients were randomised to each group. In the percutaneous injection group, 18 patients experienced recurrence, and 3 died of cancer. In the surgical resection group, 15 patients had recurrence, and 5 died of cancer. Cox regression and Kaplan-Meier analysis showed no significant difference in recurrence and survival between groups. Tumor size >2 cm and alpha-fetoprotein >200 ng/mL were associated with higher recurrence, while Child class B cirrhosis correlated with shorter survival. No significant adverse events were reported.\n\nInterpretation: Percutaneous ethanol injection therapy is as safe and effective as surgical resection for small hepatocellular carcinoma, offering a viable first-line treatment option. Trial registration and funding details were not provided.",
