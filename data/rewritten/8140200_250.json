  "abstract": "Title: Randomised Controlled Trial of Surgical Cognitive Simulation Training in Surgical Trainees\n\n250-word version:\n\nBackground: Despite the recognition of human factors, the application of psychological methods by surgeons to enhance performance is limited. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of surgical cognitive simulation (SCS) training in improving surgical skills.\n\nMethods: This randomised controlled trial involved general surgical trainees in years 3–5 from the West Midlands Deanery. Participants were randomly assigned to an intervention group receiving SCS training or a control group with no training. The primary outcome was the change in procedure-based assessment scores, measured over four months. Randomisation was conducted using a random number generator, and outcome assessors were blinded to group allocation.\n\nResults: Of 21 participants recruited between January and June 2021, 10 were randomised to the intervention group and 11 to the control group. Complete data were available for 7 participants in each group. The intervention group showed a statistically significant improvement in 11 of 16 assessment domains (P < 0.050) and a mean reduction in procedure time (–15.98 vs. –1.14 min; P = 0.024). No adverse events were reported.\n\nInterpretation: SCS training significantly improved surgical performance, with subjective feedback indicating enhanced preoperative preparedness and intraoperative focus. SCS may serve as a valuable adjunct in surgical training.\n\nTrial registration: Not provided.\n\nFunding: Supported by Health Education England (West Midlands) and the Alan Turing Institute.",
