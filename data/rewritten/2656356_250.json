A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Self-Hypnotic Relaxation for Pain and Anxiety Management in Outpatient Breast Biopsy\n\nBackground: Managing pain and anxiety pharmacologically in outpatient settings is limited. This study evaluates the efficacy of adjunct self-hypnotic relaxation during large core needle breast biopsy.\n\nMethods: In a randomised controlled trial, 236 women referred to an urban tertiary university-affiliated medical center were randomised to standard care (n=76), structured empathic attention (n=82), or self-hypnotic relaxation (n=78). Eligibility criteria included adult women undergoing biopsy. Randomisation was computer-generated, and allocation was concealed. Blinding was not applicable. The primary outcome was self-rated pain and anxiety on 0–10 verbal analog scales, measured at 10-minute intervals.\n\nResults: Anxiety increased in the standard group (logit slope = 0.18, p < 0.001), remained unchanged in the empathy group (slope = −0.04, p = 0.45), and decreased in the hypnosis group (slope = −0.27, p < 0.001). Pain increased in all groups (logit slopes: standard care = 0.53, empathy = 0.37, hypnosis = 0.34; all p < 0.001), with less increase in hypnosis and empathy groups (p = 0.024 and p = 0.018). No significant differences in room time and cost were observed.\n\nInterpretation: Self-hypnotic relaxation significantly reduces anxiety and moderates pain increase during breast biopsy without additional cost, making it a viable option for outpatient pain management.\n\nTrial registration: [Trial registration number]\n\nFunding: [Source of funding]",
