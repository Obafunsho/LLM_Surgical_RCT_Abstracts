This trial aimed to determine if long-term DAPT reduces ischemic stroke occurrence compared to short-term DAPT.\n\nMethods: This multicenter, open-label, parallel-group randomised controlled trial was conducted in 17 hospitals in Japan. Patients aged ≥20 years, treated with SACE, and on DAPT were eligible. Exclusion criteria included recent ruptured aneurysm and high bleeding risk. Participants were randomised 1:1 to long-term (12 months) or short-term (3 months) DAPT with aspirin and clopidogrel. The primary outcome was time to ischemic stroke from 3 to 12 months post-SACE. Randomisation was web-based, with no blinding. The trial was registered (jRCTs051180141).\n\nResults: From November 4, 2016, to January 7, 2019, 142 patients were randomised: 65 to long-term and 68 to short-term DAPT. Analysis included 65 in the long-term and 68 in the short-term group. Ischemic stroke occurred in 0 patients in the long-term group and 1 in the short-term group (0.0 vs 2.1/100 person-years; P=0.33). Two hemorrhagic events occurred in the long-term group. The incidence of death or any stroke was similar between groups (2.2 vs 2.1/100 person-years; P=0.97). Retreatment of the aneurysm or stent issues occurred in 1 long-term and 3 short-term patients (2.2 vs 6.4/100 person-years; P=0.36).\n\nInterpretation: No significant difference in ischemic stroke rates was found between long- and short-term DAPT. The trial was funded by Daiichi Sankyo Co., Ltd. Japan. Further studies with larger sample sizes are needed to evaluate the benefits of long-term DAPT after SACE.",
