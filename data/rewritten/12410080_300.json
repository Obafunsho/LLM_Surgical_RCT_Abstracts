This study evaluates the impact of continuous wireless vital sign monitoring with real-time alerts on reducing these deviations and complications.\n\nMethods: This randomised controlled trial was conducted in two major university hospitals in Denmark. Adult patients undergoing major noncardiac surgery were randomised 1:1 to standard care or standard care plus continuous wireless monitoring. The primary outcome was the cumulative duration of severe vital sign deviations per 24 hours. Secondary outcomes included adverse events within 30 days. Randomisation was computer-generated, and outcome assessors were blinded. The sample size was calculated to detect a 50% reduction in deviation duration with 80% power and 0.05 alpha.\n\nResults: Between January 2021 and October 2022, 400 patients were randomised (200 intervention, 200 control). The median duration of severe vital sign deviations was 60 minutes [IQR 25–136] in the intervention group versus 76 minutes [IQR 28–192] in the control group (P = .19). The intervention group had a mean reduction of 47 minutes per day for SpO2 <88% (95% CI, 18–80; P = .02). Adverse events occurred in 31.5% of the intervention group versus 42.5% of the control group (P = .03). Serious adverse events were 29.5% in the intervention group versus 34.5% in the control group (P = .39).\n\nInterpretation: Continuous monitoring did not significantly reduce cumulative severe vital sign deviations but did reduce desaturations and adverse events. These findings support further research into continuous monitoring for improving postoperative outcomes.\n\nTrial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT04640415.\n\nFunding: Innovation Fund Denmark (8056-00055B).",
