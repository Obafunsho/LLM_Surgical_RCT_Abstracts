As peripheral artery disease and diabetes prevalence rise, the public health impact of CLTI escalates. Current patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) for CLTI are heterogeneous and lack specificity. This systematic review evaluates existing PROMs and identifies gaps for developing a unified instrument.\n\nMethods: A systematic literature review was conducted on studies from 1990 to 2020 using PUBMED, focusing on English articles with abstracts. Studies included patients with CLTI and reported a PROM or health-related quality of life metric. From 337 initially identified studies, 99 met the inclusion criteria.\n\nResults: Over 20 different PROMs were identified in CLTI studies, with the most common being the World Health Organization Quality of Life BREF, VascuQoL, Short Form measures, and EQ-5D. The use of PROMs in CLTI studies has increased over time, but no single PROM adequately captures all relevant domains for CLTI patients. The review highlights the need for a unified PROM that addresses the specific challenges and diverse experiences of CLTI patients.\n\nInterpretation: Existing PROMs for CLTI are inadequate due to their lack of specificity and comprehensive coverage of relevant domains. A unified, validated PROM is essential to improve clinical care and research outcomes. Developing such a tool requires multidisciplinary collaboration and investment to accurately reflect the patient experience and treatment effects in CLTI. This effort will facilitate better clinical decision-making, enhance research comparability, and improve public awareness of CLTI. The development of a unified PROM will ultimately lead to more precise measurement of treatment effects and progress in the care of patients with CLTI.",
