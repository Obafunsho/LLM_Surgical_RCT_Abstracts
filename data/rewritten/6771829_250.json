The primary objective was to assess overall survival.\n\nMethods: This multicentre, open-label, randomised controlled trial recruited 1063 patients from 2007 to 2014. Participants were randomised to receive ECX with or without bevacizumab. Randomisation was computer-generated, and allocation was concealed. Blinding was not applied. The primary outcome was overall survival, measured from randomisation to death from any cause.\n\nResults: Of 1063 randomised patients, 895 underwent resection, with surgical details available for 880. Postoperative complications occurred in 458 patients (52.5%), with 71 (8.1%) experiencing life-threatening complications. The anastomotic leak rate was 13.5% overall, higher in the ECX-B group (23.6% vs. 9.9% in ECX). Pathological data were available for 845 patients; 82.5% had at least 15 nodes removed, with a median harvest of 24 nodes. The R1 resection rate was 24.9%.\n\nInterpretation: The trial demonstrated no significant difference in overall survival between the treatment arms. Surgical performance met protocol criteria, but the high anastomotic leak rate in the ECX-B group warrants further investigation. Trial registration: NCT00450203.
