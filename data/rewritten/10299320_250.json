This study reviews our institutional experience with sutureless aortic valve replacement (SU-AVR) using the Perceval valve.\n\nMethods: We conducted a retrospective analysis of 200 consecutive patients who underwent SU-AVR at a single center between December 2019 and February 2023. Participants included patients with moderate-to-severe aortic valve disease, with a mean age of 69.3 years and a mean logistic EuroSCORE-II of 5.2%. The primary outcome was mortality at various time points, and secondary outcomes included postoperative complications.\n\nResults: An isolated SU-AVR was performed in 85 patients, while 75 underwent concomitant CABG and 40 had multivalve procedures. The mean cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) and cross-clamp (CC) times were 82.1 and 55.5 minutes, respectively. In-hospital, 30-day, 6-month, and 1-year mortality rates were 4.5%, 6.5%, 7.5%, and 8.2%, respectively. The postoperative transvalvular mean pressure gradient was 6.3 mmHg and remained stable. No paravalvular leakage was reported, and the incidence of stroke was 0.5%.\n\nInterpretation: Sutureless aortic valve prostheses facilitate minimally invasive surgery with favorable hemodynamic performance and reduced CC and CPB times. The approach is safe and durable for surgical aortic valve replacement.",
