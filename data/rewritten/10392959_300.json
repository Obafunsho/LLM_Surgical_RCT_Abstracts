A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Exercise and Nutritional Intake Post-Oesophagectomy\n\nBackground: Post-treatment nutritional challenges are common in patients with localized oesophageal cancer. This study assesses the effects of a 12-week supervised exercise programme on energy and protein intake, body composition, and malnutrition risk.\n\nMethods: Conducted in nine Dutch hospitals from 2015 to 2019, this multicentre randomised controlled trial involved patients post-oesophagectomy. Participants were randomly assigned to a 12-week exercise intervention or usual care. The primary outcome was quality of life, with secondary outcomes including dietary intake and body composition. Randomisation was computer-generated, and allocation was concealed. Blinding was not applicable.\n\nParticipants: Eligibility criteria included patients post-oesophagectomy. Of 120 participants, 79 were invited for dietetic measurements, and 37 consented.\n\nResults: At baseline, 63.2% had adequate energy intake, and 37.6% had adequate protein intake. Post-intervention, no significant differences in energy and protein intake were observed between groups. The exercise group showed a non-significant weight reduction compared to controls (−1.19 kg, 95% CI −2.48 to 0.10). Malnutrition risk declined in the exercise group but was not significantly different from controls. The exercise group had a higher measured resting energy expenditure per kg weight (1.62 kcal/kg, 95% CI 0.42 to 2.81).\n\nInterpretation: The exercise programme did not significantly improve dietary intake but showed a trend towards reduced malnutrition risk and increased energy expenditure. These findings highlight the need for integrated nutritional strategies during exercise programmes to enhance recovery post-oesophagectomy.\n\nTrial registration: NTR5045.\n\nFunding: Not specified.",
