ILR involved lymphatic anastomosis to a regional vein using microsurgical techniques, while the control group had cut lymphatics ligated. The primary outcome was the incidence of BCRL, defined as ≥10% relative volume change (RVC) from baseline in the affected extremity at 12, 18, or 24 months. Randomisation was computer-generated, and allocation was concealed. Outcome assessors were blinded. Participants were evaluated at baseline and every 6 months postoperatively up to 24 months, with indocyanine green (ICG) lymphography performed at baseline, 12, and 24 months.\n\nResults: A total of 144 patients were randomised, with 72 in each group. Preliminary analysis includes 99 patients with 12-month follow-up, 70 with 18-month follow-up, and 40 with 24-month follow-up. The cumulative incidence of BCRL was 9.5% in the ILR group and 32% in the control group (p=0.014). The ILR group demonstrated lower bioimpedance values, decreased compression usage, improved lymphatic function on ICG lymphography, and better quality of life. No significant adverse events were reported.\n\nInterpretation: Preliminary results indicate that ILR significantly reduces BCRL incidence after ALND. The trial aims to complete accrual of 174 patients with 24-month follow-up. Trial registration: [Registration Number]. Funding: [Source of Funding]. These findings support the potential of ILR as a standard procedure to mitigate BCRL risk in breast cancer patients undergoing ALND.",
