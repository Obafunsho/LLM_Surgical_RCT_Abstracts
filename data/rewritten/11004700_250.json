Participants were non-randomly assigned to PFS (57 patients, 90 legs) or CS (148 patients, 236 legs). The primary outcome was the change in Venous Clinical Severity Score (VCSS) and VEINES-QoL/Sym scores, assessed preoperatively and 30 days post-treatment. \n\nResults: Both treatments significantly improved VCSS and VEINES scores (p < 0.05). CS showed greater improvements in VCSS (mean difference = 4.02, 95% CI 3.1 to 5.0; p < 0.001), VEINES-QoL (mean difference = 8, 95% CI 6.5 to 9.5; p < 0.001), and VEINES-Sym (mean difference = 11.66, 95% CI 9.8 to 13.5; p < 0.001) compared to PFS. No adverse events were reported in either group.\n\nInterpretation: Both PFS and CS improved quality of life in patients with varicose veins, but CS provided more significant benefits. The study was not randomised, and no blinding was used. Trial registration: Not provided. Funding: Not disclosed.",
