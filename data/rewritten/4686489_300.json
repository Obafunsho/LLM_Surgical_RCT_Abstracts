A 300-word version\n\nTitle: A Randomised Controlled Trial Comparing Patient-Specific Instrumentation with Conventional Techniques in Unicompartmental Knee Arthroplasty\n\nBackground: Proper component alignment in unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA) is crucial for implant longevity and patient outcomes. This study investigates whether patient-specific instrumentation (PSI) offers superior results compared to conventional methods.\n\nMethods: This randomised controlled trial included 60 patients, aged 54–72 years, with a mean BMI of 28 kg/m², undergoing UKA. Participants were randomised to receive either PSI or conventional instrumentation. The primary outcome was gait parameters, assessed using three-dimensional analysis at 1 year post-surgery. Secondary outcomes included implant positioning on radiographs at 3 months and patient-reported outcomes at 3 months and 1 year. Randomisation was conducted using a computer-generated sequence, with allocation concealment ensured. Outcome assessors were blinded to the intervention.\n\nResults: At 1 year, no significant differences were found in gait parameters between the PSI and conventional groups: double limb support (31% vs. 30%; p = 0.67) and walking speed (1.59 m/s vs. 1.57 m/s; p = 0.41). Implant positioning and functional scores (KSS) were comparable between groups at 3 months and 1 year. No adverse events were reported in either group.\n\nInterpretation: The findings suggest that PSI does not provide significant benefits in terms of alignment, pain, or function compared to conventional techniques in UKA. Given the lack of substantial advantages, the additional cost and uncertainty associated with PSI may not be warranted.\n\nTrial registration: [Trial registration number]\n\nFunding: [Source of funding]",
