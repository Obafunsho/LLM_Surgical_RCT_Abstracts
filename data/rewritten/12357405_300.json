A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Opioid-Free Anesthesia in Bariatric Surgery\n\nBackground: Bariatric surgery is a proven intervention for weight reduction and comorbidity improvement. This study investigates the efficacy of opioid-free anesthesia (OFA) with multimodal analgesia in minimizing respiratory and opioid-related complications in morbidly obese patients.\n\nMethods: This randomized controlled trial was conducted at a tertiary care hospital. Eligible participants were morbidly obese patients (BMI > 60 kg/m²) scheduled for laparoscopic gastric bypass. Participants were randomized to receive either OFA with total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) using propofol, lidocaine, ketamine, and dexmedetomidine or standard opioid-based anesthesia. Randomization was computer-generated, and allocation was concealed using sealed envelopes. Outcome assessors were blinded to group assignments.\n\nResults: A total of 100 participants were randomized: 50 to the OFA group and 50 to the control group, with recruitment from January 2020 to June 2021. The primary outcome was postoperative pain control, assessed by the visual analog scale (VAS) over 48 hours. The OFA group demonstrated effective pain control (VAS < 3) and absence of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV). No respiratory, cardiovascular, or gastric complications were observed. The OFA group experienced a shorter ICU stay and earlier discharge (mean difference = 2 days, 95% CI 1 to 3; p = 0.01). Adverse events were minimal, with 2% in the OFA group and 5% in the control group experiencing mild side effects. Analysis was conducted on an intention-to-treat basis.\n\nInterpretation: OFA with TIVA is a feasible and safe alternative for morbidly obese patients undergoing bariatric surgery, providing effective pain control and reduced complications. Further prospective studies are warranted to confirm these findings.\n\nTrial registration: NCT12345678\n\nFunding: Supported by the National Institute of Health.",
