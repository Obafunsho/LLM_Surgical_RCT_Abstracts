The study was conducted during elective CABG. Patients were monitored using a Pressure Record Analytical Method (PRAM) for stroke volume index (SVI), CCE, and stroke volume variation (SVV). PAPP was calculated using peak systolic aortic pressure and peak aortic blood flow velocity. EF was estimated via TEE. Eight patients received dobutamine 2.5 μg/kg/min before cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) to assess ventricular reserve.\n\nResults: No significant differences were observed between preoperative and postoperative hemodynamic data. Strong correlations were found between PAPP and CCE, SVI, and EF both pre- and postoperatively (P < 0.001). Dobutamine infusion improved PAPP values (2.4 ± 0.9 vs 3.2 ± 0.8) in all eight patients, though statistical analysis was limited by sample size.\n\nInterpretation: PAPP, CCE, and EF are effective for assessing ventricular performance in CABG patients using low-invasive monitoring. No adverse events were reported.\n\nTrial registration: Not provided.\n\nFunding: Not disclosed.",
