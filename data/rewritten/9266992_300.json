A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Autologous Bone Marrow Mononuclear Cells for Critical Limb Ischaemia\n\nBackground: Critical limb ischaemia (CLI) is a severe form of peripheral arterial disease, often leading to amputation. This study assesses the benefits and harms of intramuscular transplantation of autologous bone marrow mononuclear cells (BMMNCs) in CLI patients.\n\nMethods: We conducted a randomised controlled trial with 176 participants diagnosed with CLI. Participants were randomly assigned to receive intramuscular BMMNCs or control (conventional therapy, diluted autologous peripheral blood, or saline). The primary outcomes were all-cause mortality, pain, and amputation, evaluated over 12 months. Randomisation was computer-generated, and allocation was concealed. Blinding details were not specified.\n\nResults: A total of 176 participants were randomised: 88 to the BMMNC group and 88 to the control group. The analysis followed an intention-to-treat approach. Mortality showed no significant difference between groups (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.15 to 6.63). Pain assessment varied, with one study indicating greater reduction in the BMMNC group. Amputation rates suggested a potential small effect (RR 0.52, 95% CI 0.27 to 0.99), but this was not significant after sensitivity analysis (RR 0.52, 95% CI 0.19 to 1.39). No significant differences were found in side effects (RR 2.13, 95% CI 0.50 to 8.97).\n\nInterpretation: The trial provides very low to low-certainty evidence, insufficient to support the use of BMMNCs for CLI. Larger, well-designed trials are necessary to establish the efficacy of this intervention.\n\nTrial registration: Not provided.\n\nFunding: Not specified.",
