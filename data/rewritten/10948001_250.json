This study aims to evaluate the feasibility of acupuncture as an alternative treatment for acute pain in the ED.\n\nMethods: This NIH-funded multi-site feasibility study used a randomised controlled trial design. Participants were eligible if they presented with acute pain in the ED, including trauma, low back pain, abdominal pain, musculoskeletal pain, renal colic, or headache. The intervention group received a flexible acupuncture treatment tailored to common ED scenarios, while the control group received usual care. Randomisation was conducted using a computer-generated sequence, and allocation was concealed. Blinding was not possible for patients and clinicians, but outcome assessors were blinded. The primary outcome was pain reduction, measured immediately post-intervention.\n\nResults: A total of 200 participants were randomised, with 100 in each group. Data from 98 participants in the intervention group and 97 in the control group were analysed using an intention-to-treat approach. The intervention group showed a significant reduction in pain compared to the control group (mean difference = 5.2 mm Hg, 95% CI 3.1 to 7.3; p = 0.01). Adverse events were mild and occurred in 3% of the intervention group and 1% of the control group.\n\nInterpretation: The study supports the feasibility of acupuncture for acute pain management in the ED, warranting further investigation in a larger trial.\n\nTrial registration: NCT04880733 (ClinicalTrials.gov).\n\nFunding: This study was funded by the National Institutes of Health.",
