This study aims to evaluate the safety of general anesthesia in adenotonsillectomy, focusing on preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative factors.\n\nMethods: This randomised controlled trial was conducted in a tertiary care setting. Participants included children under 15 years old undergoing adenotonsillectomy, with eligibility criteria focusing on obstructive sleep apnea and other comorbidities. The intervention group received a specific anesthetic protocol, while the control group received standard care. Randomisation was performed using a computer-generated sequence, with allocation concealment ensured by sealed envelopes. Blinding was applied to outcome assessors.\n\nResults: A total of 200 participants were randomised, with 100 in each group. The primary outcome was the incidence of perioperative respiratory events, measured over a 24-hour postoperative period. The intervention group showed a significant reduction in respiratory events compared to the control group (mean difference = 5.2 events, 95% CI 3.1 to 7.3; p = 0.01). Adverse events were reported in 3% of the intervention group and 1% of the control group, with mild severity.\n\nInterpretation: The study demonstrates that a tailored anesthetic protocol can significantly reduce perioperative respiratory events in pediatric adenotonsillectomy. Further research is needed to explore long-term outcomes and neurodevelopmental impacts.\n\nTrial registration: [Trial registration number]\n\nFunding: The study was funded by [Funding source].",
