This study evaluates the efficacy of Botulinum Toxin Type A (BtX-A) in reducing calf pain and improving range of motion (ROM) during tibial distraction osteogenesis.\n\nMethods: In this double-blind, randomised controlled trial, 36 patients undergoing bilateral tibia lengthening were enrolled between April 2010 and January 2011. Eligibility criteria included patients undergoing stature lengthening with either lengthening over a nail or lengthening and then nailing. Each patient received a 200 IU BtX-A injection in one calf muscle, while the contralateral leg received a saline injection as a control. Randomisation was performed at the leg level, and allocation was concealed. The primary outcome was the difference in calf pain measured by VAS scores and ROM of the knees and ankles, assessed until the end of the consolidation phase. Minimum follow-up was 24 months.\n\nResults: No significant differences were observed in calf pain, knee and ankle ROM, or maximal calf circumferences between the treated and control legs at any time point. The study was powered to detect a 50% difference in treatment effect.\n\nInterpretation: Local injection of 200 IU BtX-A does not reduce calf pain or enhance ROM during tibial lengthening. Larger trials are needed to explore smaller clinical effects.\n\nTrial registration: Not provided.\n\nFunding: Not specified.",
