A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Prehabilitation in Esophagogastric Cancer Surgery\n\nBackground: Preserving functional capacity is crucial for patients with esophagogastric cancer. This study evaluates the effectiveness of prehabilitation in improving functional status in these patients.\n\nMethods: This randomised clinical trial was conducted at McGill University Health Centre, Montreal, Canada. Participants were adults awaiting elective esophagogastric resection for cancer. The intervention group received preoperative exercise and nutrition optimization, while the control group received standard care. The primary outcome was the change in functional capacity, measured by the 6-minute walk distance (6MWD), assessed preoperatively and 4 to 8 weeks postoperatively. Sixty-eight patients were randomised, with 51 included in the primary analysis. Randomisation was computer-generated, and allocation was concealed. Outcome assessors were blinded.\n\nResults: The prehabilitation group showed significant improvement in functional capacity compared to the control group both preoperatively (mean 6MWD change, 36.9 m vs −22.8 m; P < .001) and postoperatively (mean 6MWD change, 15.4 m vs −81.8 m; P < .001). No adverse events were reported.\n\nInterpretation: Prehabilitation significantly enhances perioperative functional capacity in esophagogastric surgery, potentially impacting the cancer care continuum.
