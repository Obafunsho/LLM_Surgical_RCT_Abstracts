A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial on the Impact of Simulation Training on Catheter Skills Acquisition in Surgical Residents\n\nBackground: Surgical simulation has been shown to enhance training in general surgery. This study evaluates the impact of simulation on the acquisition of catheter skills by surgical residents.\n\nMethods: In this randomised controlled trial, 20 general surgery residents were recruited and received didactic training in catheter intervention techniques. Participants were randomised into two groups: 10 residents received additional training with the Procedicus computer-based haptic simulator, while 10 served as controls. The primary outcome was resident performance during two consecutive mentored catheter-based interventions for lower extremity occlusive disease, assessed using 18 procedural steps and a global rating scale. Randomisation was conducted using a computer-generated sequence, and attending surgeons blinded to training status graded performance. The study was conducted in an OR/angiography suite.\n\nResults: Residents exposed to simulation scored higher than controls during the first intervention: procedural steps (50 ± 6 vs. 33 ± 9, P = 0.0015); global rating scale (30 ± 7 vs. 19 ± 5, P = 0.0052). The advantage persisted in the second intervention: procedural steps (53 ± 6 vs. 36 ± 7, P = 0.0006); global rating scale (33 ± 6 vs. 21 ± 6, P = 0.0015). Simulation training led to enhancement in almost all individual performance measures. No adverse events were reported.\n\nInterpretation: Simulation training significantly enhances catheter skills acquisition in surgical residents and should be integrated into training programs. This approach may also benefit vascular surgeons seeking retraining in catheter-based interventions. Trial registration: [Trial registration number]. Funding: [Source of funding].",
