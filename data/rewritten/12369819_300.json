The primary outcome was the incidence of all-cause mortality, stroke, new myocardial infarction, new coronary angiography, and new revascularization, measured over a median follow-up of 3.6 years. The study did not involve randomisation or blinding.\n\nResults: Of the total cohort, 2,869 patients (15.8%) underwent preoperative flow assessment, with an increase from 7.1% in 2013 to 21.5% in 2020. Patients with flow assessment were younger, had a lower EuroSCORE II, and received fewer distal anastomoses (3.0 ± 0.9 vs 3.2 ± 1, P < .001). There were no significant differences in mortality, post-discharge myocardial infarction, or stroke between groups. However, preoperative flow assessment was associated with a higher risk of new angiography (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 1.32, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.08–1.62, P = .008) and new revascularization (aHR 1.55, 95% CI 1.18–2.04, P = .002) more than two years after CABG.\n\nInterpretation: Preoperative flow assessment did not improve clinical outcomes and was associated with increased risk for new angiography and revascularization after two years. These findings suggest that the use of flow assessment with current cut-off levels may not be applicable in CABG, and further studies are warranted.\n\nTrial registration: Not applicable.\n\nFunding: Not specified.",
