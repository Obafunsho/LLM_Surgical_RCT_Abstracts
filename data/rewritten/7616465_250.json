A 250-word version\n\nTitle: A Randomised Controlled Trial of Delayed Autologous Treg Therapy in Kidney Transplant Recipients\n\nBackground: This randomised controlled trial aimed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of delayed autologous regulatory T-cell (Treg) therapy in living donor kidney transplant recipients, following alemtuzumab induction. The objective was to assess whether this approach could facilitate safe immunosuppression minimization to tacrolimus monotherapy.\n\nMethods: Conducted at a single center in the UK, eligible participants were first-time kidney transplant recipients. Participants were randomized to receive either Treg therapy at 26 weeks post-transplantation with tacrolimus weaning or standard immunosuppression with tacrolimus and mycophenolate mofetil. The primary outcome was graft survival and acute rejection-free survival within 18 months. Randomization was computer-generated, and allocation was concealed. Blinding was not applied.\n\nResults: Seven participants were randomized, with three receiving Treg therapy. All participants completed the study. Graft survival was 100% in both groups, and acute rejection-free survival was 100% in the Treg group. A transient increase in peripheral Treg numbers was observed post-infusion. No severe adverse events were reported.\n\nTrial registration: ISRCTN11038572.\n\nFunding: The study was funded by institutional grants.",
