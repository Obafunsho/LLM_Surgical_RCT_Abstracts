Participants were then randomly assigned to continue ropivacaine or switch to normal saline. The primary outcomes were time to meet three discharge criteria (adequate analgesia, independence from intravenous analgesics, ambulation ≥ 30 m) and ambulation distance in 6 minutes the afternoon after surgery. Randomisation was computer-generated, and allocation was concealed. Blinding included patients and outcome assessors. \n\nResults: A total of 47 patients were randomised: 24 to the ropivacaine group and 23 to the control group, with analysis conducted on an intention-to-treat basis. The ropivacaine group met discharge criteria in a median of 29 hours (25th-75th percentiles: 24-45) compared to 51 hours (42-73) in the control group (estimated ratio = 0.62; 95% CI, 0.45-0.92; P = 0.011). Median ambulation distance was 34 m (9-55) for ropivacaine versus 20 m (6-46) for saline (estimated ratio = 1.3; 95% CI, 0.6-3.0; P = 0.42). Adverse events included three falls in the ropivacaine group (13%), with none in the control group.\n\nInterpretation: A 4-day ambulatory cLPB significantly reduces the time to meet discharge criteria but does not significantly increase ambulation distance. The increased fall risk in the ropivacaine group warrants further investigation. Trial registration: [Number]. Funding: [Source].",
