Randomisation was achieved using a computer-generated sequence, with allocation concealment via sequentially numbered opaque envelopes. The primary outcome was intra-operative morphine, isoflurane, and vecuronium requirements. Secondary outcomes included blood glucose and serum cortisol levels at baseline, post-incision, and post-operatively. Due to the intervention's nature, blinding was not feasible.\n\nResults: Of the 30 patients, 15 were randomised to each group, with 14 in Group E and 15 in Group G completing the study. Group E demonstrated a significant reduction in morphine (p < 0.001), isoflurane (p = 0.004), and vecuronium (p = 0.001) requirements. Post-operative blood glucose and serum cortisol levels were significantly lower in Group E (p = 0.0153 and p = 0.0074, respectively). Adverse events in Group E included bradycardia in 6.6% and hypotension in 13.3% of patients, both manageable with standard interventions.\n\nInterpretation: The addition of cervical epidural analgesia to general anesthesia significantly reduces opioid and anesthetic requirements and stress response compared to general anesthesia alone in head and neck cancer surgery. These findings suggest potential benefits in peri-operative management.\n\nTrial registration: Not provided.\n\nFunding: The study reported no financial support.",
