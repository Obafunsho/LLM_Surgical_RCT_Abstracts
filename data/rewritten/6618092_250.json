A 250-word version\n\nTitle: A Randomised Controlled Trial Comparing Endovenous Laser Ablation and Radiofrequency Ablation for Great Saphenous Vein Incompetence\n\nBackground: Endovenous thermal ablation is a common treatment for varicose veins, with endovenous laser ablation (EVLA) and radiofrequency ablation (RFA) being the most used techniques. This study aimed to compare the efficacy of EVLA with direct RFA (dRFA) and indirect RFA (iRFA).\n\nMethods: A single-centre, double-blind, three-arm, superiority randomised controlled trial was conducted at the Phlebology Centre, Isala, Zwolle, from October 2010 to January 2014. Adult patients with symptomatic great saphenous vein (GSV) incompetence were randomised to receive EVLA, dRFA, or iRFA. The primary outcome was GSV occlusion rate at 12 months. Randomisation was performed using stratified block randomisation, and allocation was concealed. Patients, clinicians, and outcome assessors were blinded.\n\nResults: A total of 451 patients were randomised, with 450 receiving treatment (EVLA, 148; dRFA, 152; iRFA, 150). Intention-to-treat analysis showed occlusion rates of 75.0% (95% CI 68.0 to 82.0) for EVLA, 59.9% (52.1 to 67.7) for dRFA, and 81.3% (75.1 to 87.6) for iRFA. Adverse events were more frequent in the EVLA group, particularly pain.\n\nInterpretation: EVLA and iRFA demonstrated superior GSV occlusion rates compared to dRFA. All treatments improved clinical severity, but EVLA was associated with more adverse events. Trial registration: NL27871.075.10. Funding: Not specified.",
