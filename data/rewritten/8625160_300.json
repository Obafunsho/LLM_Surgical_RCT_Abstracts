This study investigates the potential of stem cell therapy to replace fibrotic tissue with functional myocardium.\n\nMethods: A multicenter randomised controlled trial was conducted. Participants with ischemic cardiac injury and NYHA class I-III symptoms were included. Randomisation was achieved using a computer-generated sequence, with allocation concealment via sealed envelopes. Blinding was applied to outcome assessors and patients. Participants were randomised to receive either stem cell therapy or placebo.\n\nIntervention: The intervention group received 150 million autologous BM MSCs, 5 million c-kit+ CPCs, or both via transendocardial injection. The control group received PlasmaLyte A.\n\nObjective: To evaluate the effect of stem cell therapy on cardiac function.\n\nOutcome: The primary outcome was the change in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) over a six-month period.\n\nResults: A total of 144 participants were randomised, with 125 completing the study. LVEF changes were not significantly different between the intervention and control groups. However, the occurrence of major adverse cardiac events was significantly reduced in the CPC group (p = 0.043). Quality of life scores were significantly better in the MSC and MSC+CPC groups compared to placebo.\n\nHarm: No severe adverse events were reported, indicating the safety of the intervention.\n\nTrial registration: NCT02501811\n\nFunding: The trial was funded by the National Institutes of Health.\n\nThis study highlights the potential of stem cell therapy in improving quality of life and reducing adverse cardiac events, although significant changes in LVEF were not observed. Further research is needed to explore the long-term benefits and mechanisms of action of stem cell therapy in myocardial regeneration.",
