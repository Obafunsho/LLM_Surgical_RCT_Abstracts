A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial on Obstructive Sleep Apnea in Atrial Fibrillation Patients\n\nBackground: Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a common yet underdiagnosed condition in atrial fibrillation (AF) patients, complicating management and outcomes. This study evaluates OSA prevalence and diagnostic strategies in AF populations.\n\nMethods: This randomised controlled trial was conducted in cardiology units, enrolling adult AF patients. Participants were randomly assigned to either polysomnography (PSG) or home sleep apnea testing (HSAT) for OSA diagnosis. The primary outcome was OSA prevalence, assessed over a 12-month period. Randomisation was computer-generated, with allocation concealment via sealed envelopes. Outcome assessors were blinded to group assignments.\n\nResults: A total of 200 participants were randomised: 100 to the PSG group and 100 to the HSAT group, between January 2020 and June 2021. Analysis included 98 participants in the PSG group and 97 in the HSAT group, using an intention-to-treat approach. OSA prevalence was 65% in the PSG group and 60% in the HSAT group (mean difference = 5%, 95% CI -5% to 15%; p = 0.30). The study found a consistent burden of moderate-to-severe OSA across both groups. No adverse events were reported in either group.\n\nInterpretation: The findings underscore the high prevalence of OSA in AF patients, with no significant difference between PSG and HSAT diagnostic methods. The results advocate for the integration of structured screening protocols into AF care, particularly for high-risk patients, and highlight the importance of interdisciplinary collaboration to enhance OSA detection and management.\n\nTrial registration: NCT12345678\n\nFunding: This trial was funded by the National Heart Institute.",
