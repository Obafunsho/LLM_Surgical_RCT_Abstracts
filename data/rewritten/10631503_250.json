A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Multiplayer vs. Single-Player iVR Training for Surgical Skills Acquisition\n\nBackground: Superior teamwork in the operating room (OR) is linked to enhanced technical performance and clinical outcomes. This study evaluates whether multiplayer immersive Virtual Reality (iVR) training surpasses single-player training in acquiring technical and nontechnical skills for complex surgery.\n\nMethods: In a randomised controlled trial, 40 participants were allocated to either individual or team iVR training using block randomisation with a 1:1 ratio. The study was conducted at Imperial College, London, between April and October 2021. Participants included junior orthopedic surgical residents and novice scrub technicians. The intervention involved five iVR training sessions over six weeks, followed by a real-world assessment of anterior approach total hip arthroplasty on a high-fidelity model. The primary outcome was the Non-Operative Technical Skills for Surgeons (NOTSS) score, assessed by two blinded observers.\n\nResults: Team-trained participants demonstrated superior nontechnical skills (NOTSS: 13.1±1.5 vs 10.6±1.6, P = 0.002) and completed procedures 33% faster (28.2 minutes ± 5.5 vs 41.8 ± 8.9, P < 0.001) with fewer technical errors (10.4 ± 6.1 vs 22.6 ± 5.4, P < 0.001). No adverse events were reported.\n\nInterpretation: Multiplayer iVR training enhances nontechnical skills and procedural efficiency, suggesting potential for improved surgical outcomes.
