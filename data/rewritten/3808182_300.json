A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Isolated Hepatic Perfusion with 5-FU and Oxaliplatin for Unresectable Metastatic Liver Lesions\n\nBackground: This study aimed to evaluate the safety and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of 5-FU with oxaliplatin via isolated hepatic perfusion (IHP) in patients with unresectable metastatic liver lesions.\n\nMethods: A standard 3 × 3 Phase I design was used. Participants were patients with unresectable isolated colorectal cancer (CRC) liver metastases scheduled for hepatic artery infusion (HAI) pump, conducted at a single center. IHP involved fixed-dose oxaliplatin with escalating 5-FU doses. The primary outcome was the MTD, assessed over a 6-month period. Randomisation and allocation concealment methods were not applicable. Blinding was not implemented. Systemic and IHP plasma pharmacokinetics of 5-FU, anabolites, and platinum were determined.\n\nResults: Twelve patients were enrolled, all having received at least one line of pre-IHP chemotherapy. At dose level 2 (DL2), 2 dose-limiting toxicities occurred, leading to the expansion of dose level 1 (DL1) at 200 mg/m² 5-FU, the eventual MTD. At 6-month follow-up, 9 patients (82%) showed partial response, and 2 (18%) had stable disease. Additionally, 64% of patients demonstrated a >50% decrease in carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA). The 1- and 2-year overall survival probabilities were 90.9% and 71.6%, respectively, with a median follow-up of 24 months. Adverse events included 4 grade 3 and 1 grade 4 events. IHP exposures were significantly higher than systemic exposures.\n\nInterpretation: The MTD for IHP was established at 200 mg/m² 5-FU with 40 mg/m² oxaliplatin. Minimal systemic exposure was observed. The promising response and survival outcomes suggest further evaluation in a larger phase II trial.\n\nTrial registration: Not provided.\n\nFunding: Not specified.",
