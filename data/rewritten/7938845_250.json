A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Perioperative Aspirin in Vascular Surgery: A Randomised Controlled Trial\n\nBackground: The POISE-2 trial evaluated the effects of perioperative aspirin on cardiovascular events and bleeding in non-cardiac surgery. This substudy examines the effect of aspirin in patients undergoing vascular surgery.\n\nMethods: POISE-2 was a blinded, randomised controlled trial with patients assigned to aspirin or placebo. The primary outcome was a composite of death or myocardial infarction at 30 days. Secondary outcomes included vascular occlusive complications and major bleeding. Randomisation was computer-generated, and allocation was concealed. Patients, clinicians, and outcome assessors were blinded. The study included 603 vascular surgery patients, with 319 in the continuation and 284 in the initiation stratum.\n\nResults: In patients undergoing aneurysm repair, the primary outcome occurred in 13.7% with aspirin and 9.0% with placebo (HR 1.48, 95% CI 0.71 to 3.09). For occlusive disease surgery, 15.8% on aspirin and 13.6% on placebo experienced the primary outcome (HR 1.16, 95% CI 0.62 to 2.17). No significant interaction was found for type of surgery or aspirin stratum. Bleeding rates were similar between groups.\n\nInterpretation: The findings suggest that perioperative aspirin does not significantly alter cardiovascular or vascular occlusive outcomes in vascular surgery patients. The results align with the overall POISE-2 findings. Trial registration: NCT01082874.\n\nFunding: The study was funded by [source of funding not provided in the abstract].",
