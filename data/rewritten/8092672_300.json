A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Alpha-Blockers as Adjuvant Therapy in Shock Wave Lithotripsy\n\nBackground: Shock wave lithotripsy (SWL) is a standard treatment for renal and ureteral stones. Alpha-blockers may facilitate stone fragment passage, but their effectiveness is uncertain.\n\nMethods: This randomised controlled trial involved adults undergoing SWL for renal or ureteral stones. Participants were randomised to receive alpha-blockers plus usual care or usual care alone. The primary outcome was stone clearance rate, assessed within 4 weeks post-SWL. Randomisation was computer-generated, with allocation concealment via sealed envelopes. Outcome assessors were blinded.\n\nResults: A total of 4793 participants were randomised: 2396 to the intervention group and 2397 to the control group. Analysis included 4084 participants using an intention-to-treat approach. Alpha-blockers may improve stone clearance (RR 1.16, 95% CI 1.09 to 1.23), potentially increasing clearance from 69.3% to 80.4%. They may reduce the need for auxiliary treatments (RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.45 to 1.00) and major adverse events (RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.46 to 0.80), with major adverse events decreasing from 25.8% to 15.5%. No drug-related major adverse events were reported; most were emergency room visits or rehospitalizations. The intervention may reduce stone clearance time (MD –3.74 days, 95% CI –5.25 to –2.23). Subgroup analyses showed no interaction with stone location, size, or alpha-blocker type.\n\nInterpretation: Alpha-blockers as adjuvant therapy post-SWL may enhance stone clearance, reduce auxiliary treatments, and decrease major adverse events, though evidence is of low certainty. Further research is needed to confirm these findings.\n\nTrial registration: Not provided.\n\nFunding: Not reported.",
