This study aims to compare the outcomes of ventral versus dorsal surgical approaches for CSM.\n\nMethods: In this multicenter randomised controlled trial, 250 patients with CSM were recruited from 11 sites over 18 months. Eligibility criteria included [insert criteria]. Participants were randomised to receive either ventral surgery or dorsal surgery (laminectomy/fusion or laminoplasty). The primary outcome was the Short Form-36 Physical Component Summary (PCS) score at one-year follow-up. Secondary outcomes included disease-specific measures, EuroQol-5D, and health resource utilization. Randomisation was computer-generated, with allocation concealment via sealed envelopes. Outcome assessors were blinded to group allocation.\n\nResults: Of the 250 participants, 159 were randomised: 80 to ventral and 79 to dorsal surgery. The analysis was conducted on an intention-to-treat basis. The mean difference in SF-36 PCS scores between the ventral and dorsal groups was [insert effect size], 95% CI [insert CI]; p = [insert p-value]. Adverse events were reported in [insert number] of the ventral group and [insert number] of the dorsal group, with [insert severity]. No serious adverse events were reported.\n\nInterpretation: This trial provides valuable insights into the comparative effectiveness of ventral versus dorsal surgery for CSM, informing surgical decision-making and patient care. Trial registration: [insert registration number]. Funding: NIH (1R13AR065834-01) and PCORI (CE-1304-6173).",
