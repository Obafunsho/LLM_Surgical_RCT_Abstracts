A 250-word version\n\nTitle: A Randomised Controlled Trial of Cytoreductive Surgery and Hyperthermic Intrathoracic Chemotherapy for Thymic Epithelial Tumors with Pleural Spread or Recurrence\n\nBackground: Thymic epithelial tumors (TETs) with pleural spread or recurrence present a clinical challenge with no established effective treatment. This study evaluates the safety and efficacy of cytoreductive surgery followed by hyperthermic intrathoracic chemotherapy (S-HITOC) in this context.\n\nMethods: This open, single-arm, phase II trial was conducted at Zhongshan Hospital of Fudan University. Forty-five adult patients with TETs and pleural dissemination were enrolled between August 1, 2021, and February 29, 2024. The intervention involved S-HITOC with 25 mg/m² doxorubicin and 50 mg/m² cisplatin. The primary outcome was the incidence of treatment-related adverse events of grade ≥3, measured perioperatively. No randomisation or blinding was applied.\n\nResults: Eight patients (17.8%) experienced grade ≥3 adverse events. The pain Visual Analog Scale (VAS) score was 5.4 ± 1.9 on day 1 post-treatment, returning to baseline by day 7 (p = 0.218). Quality of life scores showed no significant difference from baseline to day 60 (p = 0.676). The 2-year progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) rates were 82.8% and 100.0%, respectively. Patients with pleural tumor index (PTI) scores >10 had significantly worse PFS (p < 0.001).\n\nInterpretation: S-HITOC demonstrated manageable complication rates and promising short-term oncological outcomes for TETs with pleural spread or recurrence.
