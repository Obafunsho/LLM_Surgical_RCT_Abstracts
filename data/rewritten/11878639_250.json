A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Genetically Modified Mesenchymal Stromal Cells Overexpressing VEGF for Critical Limb Ischemia\n\nBackground: Critical limb ischemia (CLI) is a severe form of peripheral artery disease with limited treatment options. Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) have shown potential in CLI treatment but often fail to meet efficacy endpoints. This study evaluates the safety and efficacy of MSCs genetically modified to overexpress Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF-A165).\n\nMethods: This preclinical study was conducted using immune-deficient NSG mice. The intervention involved MSCs overexpressing VEGF (MSC/VEGF), while the control group received unmodified MSCs. The primary outcome was angiogenesis, assessed using a Matrigel plug model over a 6-month period. Randomisation was performed using a computer-generated sequence, and allocation was concealed. Blinding was applied to outcome assessors.\n\nResults: A total of 40 mice were randomised, with 20 receiving MSC/VEGF and 20 receiving unmodified MSCs. Analysis was conducted per protocol. MSC/VEGF demonstrated superior angiogenic potential compared to controls, with a significant increase in vascular structures (p < 0.05). Adverse events included mild to large intramuscular hematomas at the injection site in 15% of mice, with no systemic pathology observed.\n\nInterpretation: MSC/VEGF shows promise as a therapeutic for CLI, demonstrating enhanced angiogenesis and a favorable safety profile. These findings support the initiation of a first-in-human clinical trial.\n\nTrial registration: Not applicable.\n\nFunding: The study was funded by internal institutional grants.",
