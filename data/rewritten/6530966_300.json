A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Meloxicam IV for Postoperative Pain Management\n\nBackground: This study aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of meloxicam IV in reducing postoperative pain and opioid consumption in women undergoing open abdominal hysterectomy.\n\nMethods: In this multicenter, randomised, double-blind, placebo- and active-controlled trial, 486 women aged 18-65 with moderate-to-severe pain were enrolled. Participants were randomised to receive a single dose of meloxicam IV (5-60 mg), placebo, or morphine (0.15 mg/kg) within 6 hours post-morphine dosing on postoperative day 1. The coprimary outcomes were summed pain intensity difference (SPID 24) and total pain relief (TOTPAR 24) over 24 hours. Randomisation was centralised with allocation concealment, and blinding included patients, clinicians, and outcome assessors. An open-label extension involved 295 participants receiving meloxicam IV once daily.\n\nResults: All 486 participants were analysed. Meloxicam IV and morphine significantly improved SPID 24 and TOTPAR 24 compared to placebo (p < 0.001). Effect sizes for meloxicam IV ranged from 1.25 to 2.05 SDs. The mean total opioid consumption was lower in the meloxicam IV groups compared to placebo. Adverse events were generally mild, with no treatment-related serious adverse events reported. The trial was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT01084161).\n\nInterpretation: Meloxicam IV (5-60 mg) was well tolerated and reduced opioid consumption, providing rapid and sustained analgesic effects in postoperative pain management. These findings support further investigation of meloxicam IV in phase 3 trials.\n\nFunding: The study was funded by Recro Pharma, Inc.",
