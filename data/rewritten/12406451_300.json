Conventional treatments are insufficient, necessitating innovative regenerative approaches.\n\nMethods: This randomised controlled trial aimed to assess the efficacy of cardiovascular regenerative medicine (CaVaReM) in repairing heart tissue. Conducted in a clinical setting, participants with heart failure were recruited based on specific eligibility criteria. Participants were randomly assigned to receive CaVaReM interventions, including stem cells and tissue engineering, or standard care as a control. Randomisation was achieved using a computer-generated sequence, with allocation concealment via sealed envelopes. Blinding was applied to outcome assessors, patients, and clinicians.\n\nResults: A total of 200 participants were randomised, with 100 allocated to the intervention group and 100 to the control group, recruited between January 2020 and June 2021. Analysis included 98 participants in the intervention group and 97 in the control group, following an intention-to-treat approach. The primary outcome was improvement in cardiac function over 12 months, with a mean difference of 5.2% (95% CI 3.1 to 7.3; p = 0.01). Adverse events occurred in 3% of the intervention group and 1% of the control group, primarily mild gastrointestinal side-effects.\n\nInterpretation: The trial demonstrated that CaVaReM has the potential to improve cardiac function in patients with heart failure, although primary endpoints were not statistically met. Further research is warranted to confirm these findings and explore long-term benefits. Trial registration: NCT12345678. Funding: Supported by [Funding Source].",
