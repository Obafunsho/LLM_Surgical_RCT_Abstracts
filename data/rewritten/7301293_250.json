A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial on the Impact of Obesity and OSAS on Morphine Pharmacokinetics in Children\n\nBackground: Obesity and obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) may complicate perioperative pain management by altering morphine pharmacokinetics. This study investigates the independent effects of obesity, OSAS, and leptin on morphine metabolism.\n\nMethods: In this randomised controlled trial, children aged 5–12 years undergoing surgery were randomised into three groups: nonobese with severe OSAS, obese with severe OSAS, and a control group. Each participant received a morphine dose of 0.05 mg/kg. Blood samples were collected at baseline and at preset intervals for pharmacokinetic analysis. The primary outcome was the dose-adjusted mean maximum morphine concentration (C MAX ) over 540 minutes.\n\nResults: Thirty-four patients were randomised: 16 controls, 8 nonobese/OSAS, and 10 obese/OSAS. The obese/OSAS group exhibited a higher C MAX compared to controls (P < .001) and nonobese/OSAS (P = .014). They also had a lower volume of distribution (P = .007) and higher morphine 3-glucuronide (M3G) concentration (P = .012). Time to maximum morphine 6-glucuronide (M6G) concentration was shorter in both OSAS groups compared to controls (P < .005). Higher levels of CRP, IL-10, and leptin were observed in the obese/OSAS group.\n\nInterpretation: Obesity combined with OSAS increases morphine metabolism in children, potentially due to elevated leptin levels. This finding suggests the need for tailored morphine dosing in this population.\n\nTrial registration: [Trial registration number]\n\nFunding: [Source of funding]",
