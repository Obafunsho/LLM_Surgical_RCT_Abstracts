A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Personalized Pain Education and Management in Orthopaedic Trauma: A Randomised Controlled Trial\n\nBackground: This randomised controlled trial aimed to evaluate the effect of personalized pain education and management delivered by paraprofessional coaches on pain-related outcomes, opioid consumption, and patient-reported outcomes in orthopaedic trauma patients.\n\nMethods: A total of 212 patients with orthopaedic trauma were randomised to either the intervention group (104 patients) or the control group (108 patients) between February 2021 and September 2022. The intervention involved personalized pain education and management by coaches, while the control group received standard written discharge instructions. The primary outcome was the mean pain score at 12 weeks, assessed using the pain numeric rating scale. Randomisation was conducted using a computer-generated sequence, and allocation was concealed. Blinding was not specified. Analysis was conducted on 72 intervention and 57 control patients using a per-protocol approach.\n\nResults: No significant difference was found in mean pain scores at 12 weeks between the intervention and control groups. The odds ratio for achieving the minimum clinically important difference in pain scores was 2.2 (95% CI 0.9 to 5.3; p = 0.08). No differences were observed in opioid consumption or patient-reported outcomes.\n\nInterpretation: Personalized pain education and management by coaches did not significantly improve pain outcomes, opioid use, or patient-reported outcomes compared to standard care. Further research is needed to explore the potential benefits of this approach in diverse patient populations.\n\nTrial registration: Not provided.\n\nFunding: Not specified.",
