A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Adjuvant Treatment Strategies Following Neoadjuvant Chemoimmunotherapy in Resectable NSCLC\n\nBackground: This study aimed to evaluate adjuvant treatment strategies following neoadjuvant chemoimmunotherapy (NCIT) in patients with resectable non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).\n\nMethods: A retrospective analysis was conducted on 317 patients with stage IB-IIIB NSCLC treated at Shandong Cancer Hospital from January 2019 to February 2024. Patients were categorized into no-treatment (n=46), chemotherapy (ChT) (n=38), immunotherapy (IT) (n=33), chemoimmunotherapy (ChIT) (n=168), and upfront surgery with adjuvant immunotherapy (US+AIT) (n=32) groups. Event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) were primary outcomes, assessed over a median follow-up of 30.7 months. Propensity score matching (PSM) was used to balance baseline differences.\n\nResults: IT and ChIT groups showed improved EFS compared to the no-treatment group. After PSM, EFS was significantly prolonged with IT and ChIT in patients without pathological complete response (pCR). No EFS or OS benefit was observed in patients achieving pCR. Among patients with PD-L1 expression ≥1%, EFS was significantly improved with IT and ChIT compared to no-treatment and US+AIT groups.\n\nInterpretation: Adjuvant IT or ChIT may benefit patients with resectable NSCLC receiving NCIT, especially those without pCR and with positive PD-L1 expression. No significant adverse events were reported. Trial registration: Not applicable. Funding: Not specified.",
