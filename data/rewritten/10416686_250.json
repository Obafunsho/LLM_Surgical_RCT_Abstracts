The primary outcomes were the need for an emergency department visit and the incidence of seroma, measured over the postoperative period. Randomisation was computer-generated, and allocation was concealed. Blinding was not applied.\n\nResults: A total of 227 patients were randomised between July 2019 and July 2022, with 115 in the patch group and 112 in the drainage group. Analysis was conducted on all participants using an intention-to-treat approach. The incidence of emergency department visits was significantly higher in the drainage group (33.0%) compared to the patch group (7.0%), with an incidence rate difference of 26.1% (95% CI 14.5 to 37.7; p < 0.0001). Conversely, the seroma rate was higher in the patch group (49.6%) than in the drainage group (26.8%), with an incidence rate difference of 22.8% (95% CI 6.7 to 38.9; p < 0.006). Cost savings of €100.41 per patient were observed with the patch.\n\nInterpretation: The polyethylene glycol-coated patch reduced emergency department visits and costs but increased seroma incidence compared to drainage.
