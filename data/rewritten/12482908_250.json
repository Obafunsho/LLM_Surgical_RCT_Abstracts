A 250-word version\n\nTitle: A Randomised Controlled Trial Comparing Hartmann’s Procedure and Intersphincteric Abdominoperineal Excision in Rectal Cancer\n\nBackground: This multicentre randomised controlled trial aimed to compare 30-day postoperative surgical complication rates between Hartmann’s procedure (HP) and intersphincteric abdominoperineal excision (iAPE) in patients with rectal cancer unsuitable for restorative surgery.\n\nMethods: Conducted in Sweden and Finland from 2014 to 2021, eligible patients with adenocarcinoma of the rectum located ≥5 cm from the anal verge were randomised intraoperatively to HP or iAPE. The primary outcome was 30-day postoperative surgical complications. Randomisation was centralised and stratified by hospital, with allocation concealed until surgery. The analysis was intention-to-treat.\n\nResults: Of 194 eligible patients, 163 were randomised (80 to HP, 83 to iAPE). The surgical complication rate was 39% for HP and 43% for iAPE (OR 0.83; 95% CI 0.44 to 1.54; P = 0.549). Major surgical complications occurred in 14% of HP and 11% of iAPE patients (P = 0.573). Perineopelvic complications were 21% for HP and 30% for iAPE (OR 0.63; 95% CI 0.31 to 1.28; P = 0.197). Overall complication rates were 45% for HP and 49% for iAPE (P = 0.574). No significant differences were found in multivariable analysis.\n\nInterpretation: Both HP and iAPE are viable surgical options for patients unsuitable for anastomosis. The trial was underpowered and did not reach target accrual. \n\nTrial registration: NCT01995396.\n\nFunding: Not specified.",
