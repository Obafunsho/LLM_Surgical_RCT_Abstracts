A 250-word version\n\nTitle: A Randomised Controlled Trial Comparing Cemented and Uncemented Hemiarthroplasty for Displaced Femoral Neck Fractures in the Elderly\n\nBackground: Hemiarthroplasty is a common treatment for displaced femoral neck fractures in the elderly, with limited evidence on the functional outcomes of cemented versus uncemented implants.\n\nMethods: This randomised controlled trial was conducted in patients aged 70 years and older with displaced femoral neck fractures. Participants were randomised to receive either a cemented implant (n=112) or an uncemented, hydroxyapatite-coated implant (n=108), both with a bipolar head. The primary outcome was the mean Harris hip score at 3 and 12 months post-surgery. Randomisation was computer-generated, and allocation was concealed. Blinding was applied to outcome assessors.\n\nResults: A total of 220 participants were randomised between January 2020 and June 2021. The mean Harris hip score showed equivalence between groups: 70.9 in the cemented group and 72.1 in the uncemented group at 3 months (mean difference, 1.2) and 78.9 and 79.8 at 12 months (mean difference, 0.9). The uncemented group had a shorter mean surgery duration by 12.4 minutes and less mean intraoperative blood loss by 89 mL. The Barthel Index and EQ-5D scores showed no differences. Complication and mortality rates were similar. Analysis was intention-to-treat.\n\nInterpretation: Both cemented and uncemented hemiarthroplasties provide good outcomes for displaced femoral neck fractures in the elderly. No significant differences in functional outcomes were observed. Trial registration: [Trial registration number]. Funding: [Source of funding].",
