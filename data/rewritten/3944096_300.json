Participants were randomized to receive either perineural ropivacaine 0.4% or normal saline via portable infusion pumps (5 mL/h basal; 300 mL reservoir). The primary outcome was average pain on postoperative day (POD) 1, measured on a 0–10 scale. Randomization was computer-generated, and allocation was concealed using sealed envelopes. Participants, clinicians, and outcome assessors were blinded. The study was conducted at a single hospital, with eligibility criteria including adult patients undergoing mastectomy. Subjects were hospitalized for at least one night and discharged with catheters removed on POD 3. Follow-up was conducted via telephone on PODs 1, 4, 8, and 28.\n\nResults: On POD 1, the median pain score for the ropivacaine group (n=30) was 2 (interquartile range 0–3), compared to 4 (1–5) for the saline group (n=30; 95% CI difference in medians, −4.0 to −0.3; P = 0.021). Breakthrough pain severity was lower in the ropivacaine group (5 [3–6] vs 7 [5–8]; P = 0.046). No significant differences were observed post-infusion. No adverse events were reported.\n\nInterpretation: Continuous ropivacaine infusion improves analgesia and reduces functional deficits during infusion post-mastectomy. No benefits were observed after infusion discontinuation. Trial registration: [Trial registration number]. Funding: [Source of funding].",
