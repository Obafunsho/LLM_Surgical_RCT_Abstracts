Eligibility criteria included adults aged 18–65 years, excluding those with wound or inflammation at the examination site, peripheral vascular disease, or peripheral neuropathy. Skin temperature was evaluated at the dermatomal supply of the ulnar, median, and radial nerves at baseline, 5, 10, 15, and 20 minutes post-block using infrared thermography. The primary outcome was the ability of temperature change to predict failed block, defined as absence of complete sensory loss 30 minutes after block completion.\n\nResults: The AUC (95% CI) for temperature change at 5 minutes to predict failed ulnar, median, and radial nerve block was 0.79 (0.68–0.87), 0.77 (0.67–0.86), and 0.79 (0.69–0.88), respectively. AUC values increased to 0.98 (0.92–1.00), 0.97 (0.90–0.99), and 0.96 (0.89–0.99) at 15 minutes, with a negative predictive value of 100%. No adverse events were reported during the study.\n\nInterpretation: Infrared thermography provides an accurate tool for predicting failed supraclavicular brachial plexus block. Increased skin temperature at each segment can exclude block failure in the corresponding nerve with 100% accuracy. The study was approved by the institutional ethics committee (MD-376-2020) and funded by Cairo University Hospital. The findings suggest that thermal imaging is a reliable, non-invasive method for assessing block success, potentially improving patient satisfaction and clinical outcomes in upper-limb surgeries. Further research is recommended to validate these findings in larger, randomized controlled trials.",
