A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial Comparing Pancreaticojejunostomy and Pancreaticogastrostomy in High-Risk Postoperative Pancreatic Fistula Patients\n\nBackground: Postoperative pancreatic fistula (POPF) is a significant complication following pancreaticoduodenectomy, particularly in high-risk patients. This study aims to determine the optimal reconstruction method, pancreaticojejunostomy (PJ) or pancreaticogastrostomy (PG), both with externalized transanastomotic stent, for these patients.\n\nMethods: This single-center, phase 3, randomized controlled trial was conducted at the Department of General and Pancreatic Surgery, The Pancreas Institute, University of Verona Hospital Trust, Italy, from July 12, 2017, to March 15, 2019. Adults undergoing elective pancreaticoduodenectomy with a high fistula risk score (7-10) were randomized to PJ or PG. Randomization was performed using a computer-generated sequence with allocation concealment. Blinding was not applied. The primary outcome was POPF incidence, measured postoperatively. Secondary outcomes included Clavien-Dindo grade 3 or higher morbidity, postpancreatectomy hemorrhage, and delayed gastric emptying.\n\nResults: Of 604 screened, 72 were randomized (36 to PJ, 36 to PG). POPF incidence was similar between groups (PJ: 38.9%, PG: 50.0%; P = .48). PJ showed a lower average complication burden in POPF cases (0.25 vs 0.39; P = .04). PG had higher Clavien-Dindo grade 3 or higher morbidity (47.2% vs 22.2%; P = .047). \n\nInterpretation: PJ with externalized stent and octreotide omission is recommended for high-risk POPF patients due to lower complication burden and morbidity. \n\nTrial Registration: NCT03212196\n\nFunding: Not specified.",
