Eligibility criteria included resected stage IV melanoma. Participants were randomised to receive adjuvant therapy with a whole-cell melanoma vaccine plus Bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG) or placebo plus BCG. Blood specimens were collected pretreatment (n=244) and during treatment (n=214) and analysed using quantitative real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) for MART-1, MAGE-A3, and PAX3 mRNA biomarkers. Randomisation was performed using a computer-generated sequence, with allocation concealment. Blinding was applied to outcome assessors.\n\nResults: A total of 244 patients were randomised, with 122 in each group. CTC biomarkers were detected in 54% of patients pretreatment and 86% during the first 3 months. With a median follow-up of 21.9 months, 71% of patients experienced recurrence, and 48% died. Pretreatment CTC status was significantly associated with disease-free survival (DFS) (HR 1.64, p=0.002) and overall survival (OS) (HR 1.53, p=0.028). Serial CTC status was also significantly associated with DFS (HR 1.91, p=0.02) and OS (HR 2.57, p=0.012). No significant adverse events were reported.\n\nInterpretation: CTC assessment provides prognostic information before and during adjuvant treatment for resected stage IV melanoma patients. The study highlights the potential of CTCs as a prognostic tool in clinical practice. Trial registration: NCT00052156. Funding: Not specified.",
