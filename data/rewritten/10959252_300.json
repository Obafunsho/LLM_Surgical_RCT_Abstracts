A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Folate Receptor-Targeted Intraoperative Molecular Imaging for Pulmonary Nodule Localization\n\nBackground: Accurate intraoperative identification of pulmonary nodules, particularly small lesions, remains a challenge. This study investigates the safety and efficacy of folate receptor-targeted intraoperative molecular imaging using OTL38 for localizing pulmonary nodules during resection.\n\nMethods: In this Phase I trial, 20 subjects with biopsy-proven pulmonary adenocarcinomas were enrolled at a single center. Participants received OTL38, a novel folate receptor-α targeted optical contrast agent. Tumors were imaged in situ and ex vivo, and fluorescence was quantified. Resected specimens were analyzed to confirm diagnosis, and FRα expression was quantified using immunohistochemistry. A multivariate analysis was performed to determine variables impacting tumor fluorescence.\n\nResults: Three Grade I adverse events (transient nausea/abdominal pain) were observed, resolving after infusion completion. Sixteen of 20 (80%) subjects had tumors with in situ fluorescence, with a mean tumor-to-background fluorescence level of 2.9 (IQR, 2.1 to 4.2). The remaining four subjects' tumors fluoresced ex vivo. In situ fluorescence was dependent on depth from the pleural surface. Four subcentimeter nodules not identified on preoperative imaging were detected intraoperatively.\n\nInterpretation: This trial provides preliminary evidence that OTL38 is safe, with tolerable Grade I toxicity, and accumulates in known lung cancers, potentially improving the identification of synchronous malignancies. A five-center, Phase II study is being initiated to better understand the clinical implications of intraoperative molecular imaging using OTL38.\n\nTrial registration: [Trial registration number]\n\nFunding: [Source of funding]",
