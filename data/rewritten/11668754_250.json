A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial on the Effects of CPB-Induced Shear Stress on Monocyte-Endothelial Interactions\n\nBackground: Cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) induces systemic inflammation, contributing to morbidity and mortality, particularly in pediatric patients. This study investigates the impact of CPB-induced shear stress on monocyte-endothelial interactions.\n\nMethods: This in vitro randomised controlled trial used THP-1 monocyte-like cells and human neonatal dermal microvascular endothelial cells (HNDMVECs). THP-1 cells were subjected to shear stress in polyvinyl chloride tubing at 2.1 Pa for 2 hours. ELISA, adhesion and transmigration assays, qPCR, and RNA silencing were employed to assess interactions post-co-culture. The primary outcome was the level of IL-8 production and monocyte adhesion, measured over 6 hours.\n\nResults: Sheared THP-1 cells showed increased adhesion and transmigration through the HNDMVEC monolayer compared to static controls. VE-cadherin disruption and cytoskeletal reorganization were observed in HNDMVECs. Elevated IL-8 levels were detected in the sheared THP-1 and HNDMVEC co-culture medium. IL-8 treatment of HNDMVECs increased non-sheared THP-1 cell adherence and upregulated VCAM-1 and ICAM-1. Reparixin and IL-8 siRNA inhibited sheared THP-1 cell adhesion.\n\nInterpretation: CPB-like shear stress on monocytes promotes IL-8 production, increasing endothelial permeability and monocyte adhesion. This study identifies a novel mechanism of post-CPB inflammation, suggesting potential therapeutic targets to mitigate neonatal patient damage.",
