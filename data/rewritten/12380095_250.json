A 250-word version\n\nTitle: A Randomised Controlled Trial Comparing Spinal Analgesia–Epidural Analgesia and Combined Spinal–Epidural Analgesia in Reducing Neurological Complications During Labor Analgesia\n\nBackground: Neurological complications during labor analgesia are a concern, with limited studies addressing their prevention and management. This trial compares spinal analgesia–epidural analgesia (SA-EA) and combined spinal–epidural analgesia (CSEA) in reducing these complications.\n\nMethods: This randomised controlled trial was conducted at [Study Setting]. Eligible participants were [Eligibility Criteria]. Participants were randomly assigned to either the SA-EA group or the CSEA group. Randomisation was performed using [Randomisation Method] with allocation concealment via [Concealment Method]. Blinding was applied to [Blinded Parties]. The primary outcome was the incidence of neurological complications within [Timeframe]. A total of [Sample Size] participants were recruited between [Recruitment Period].\n\nIntervention: In the SA-EA group, a standard spinal needle was used for dural puncture, followed by intrathecal injection of 2mL of 0.1% ropivacaine + 1µg/mL sufentanil. An epidural catheter was then inserted. In the CSEA group, an epidural needle was used for puncture, followed by a spinal needle for dural puncture and the same intrathecal injection. An epidural catheter was inserted thereafter.\n\nResults: [Number Analysed] participants were analysed using [Analysis Approach]. The incidence of neurological complications was [Effect Size, CI, p-value]. Adverse events occurred in [Frequency and Severity by Group].\n\nInterpretation: The study provides insights into the safety and efficacy of SA-EA and CSEA, offering important references for clinical practice.
