A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial on the Impact of a Reference Guide for Bariatric Surgery Nursing Care\n\nBackground: Bariatric surgery is a critical intervention for morbid obesity, necessitating that nursing staff possess thorough knowledge to ensure effective patient care. This study aimed to assess the impact of a reference guide on nurses' knowledge and patient satisfaction.\n\nMethods: A quasi-experimental design was conducted at Mansoura University Hospital, involving 78 nurses and 156 patients. Participants were divided into two groups: 78 patients before and 78 after the guide's implementation. The primary outcome was the improvement in nurses' knowledge and patient satisfaction, measured over a 9-month period. Randomisation and allocation concealment methods were not applicable. Blinding was not implemented. Data collection tools included a sociodemographic datasheet, a knowledge questionnaire, a self-reported practice questionnaire, and a patient satisfaction measurement tool.\n\nResults: After implementing the reference guide, the percentage of nurses with good knowledge increased from 10.3% to 80.8%, and poor self-reported practices decreased from 80.8% to 5.1%. Patient satisfaction levels showed a marked improvement following the intervention. No adverse events were reported.\n\nInterpretation: The reference guide significantly improved nurses' knowledge, self-reported practices, and patient satisfaction. To sustain these improvements, it is recommended that the reference guide be made available and educational programs be provided to nursing staff. Continuous educational sessions and conferences are essential for maintaining and enhancing nurses' awareness and practices in bariatric surgery care.\n\nTrial registration: Not provided.\n\nFunding: Not specified.",
