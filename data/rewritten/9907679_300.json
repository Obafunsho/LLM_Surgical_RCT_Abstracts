Participants were randomly assigned to one of five PIEB intervals (35, 40, 45, 50, or 55 minutes) using sequentially numbered opaque envelopes. The primary outcome was effective analgesia, defined as no requirement for patient-controlled epidural analgesia (PCEA) during the first stage of labor. Blinding was maintained for patients and outcome assessors. Sample size was calculated to detect a linear trend in effective analgesia with 90% power and a significance level of 0.05.\n\nResults: Of the 100 participants, 93 were analyzed per protocol. Effective PIEB analgesia was achieved in 89.5% (17/19), 84.2% (16/19), 82.4% (14/17), 52.6% (11/19), and 36.8% (7/19) of patients in the 35, 40, 45, 50, and 55-minute groups, respectively. The estimated PIEB intervals for 50% (EI50) and 90% (EI90) effectiveness were 52.5 (95% CI, 48.4–62.6) and 37.0 (95% CI, 28.4–40.9) minutes, respectively. No severe adverse events were reported, and patient satisfaction was higher with shorter intervals.\n\nInterpretation: The study suggests that shorter PIEB intervals improve analgesia effectiveness and patient satisfaction without increasing adverse events. These findings may inform clinical practice for labor analgesia.\n\nTrial registration: ChiCTR2100047291.\n\nFunding: Not specified.",
