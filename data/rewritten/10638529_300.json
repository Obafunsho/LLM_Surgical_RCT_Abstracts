Participants were randomised 1:1 to either the intervention group using Fluobeam® LX or a control group without it. The primary outcome was the rate of low parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels on the first postoperative day. Randomisation was executed via the Eurocrine® platform, with allocation concealed from patients, ensuring a single-blinded design. The sample size calculation aimed to detect a reduction in low PTH rates from 15% to 5%, requiring 280 patients.\n\nResults: From January 2021 to August 2022, 535 patients were randomised, and 486 were analysed (246 intervention, 240 control). The intervention group had a 26.0% rate of low PTH levels compared to 32.1% in the control group (RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.61 to 1.07; p = 0.141). In a subgroup undergoing central lymph node dissection, the rates were 18.3% and 33.7%, respectively (RR 0.54, 95% CI 0.31 to 0.93; p = 0.021). No specific harm related to Fluobeam® LX was reported.\n\nInterpretation: While autofluorescence did not significantly reduce low PTH rates in the overall cohort, it was beneficial in a subgroup undergoing central lymph node dissection. The technique facilitated better identification and preservation of parathyroid glands. Trial registration: NCT04509011. Funding: Not specified.",
