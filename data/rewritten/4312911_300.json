A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial Comparing Gadoxetic Acid-Enhanced MRI, ECCM-MRI, and CE-CT for Hepatic Staging in Suspected CRCLM\n\nBackground: This multicentre international randomised controlled trial assessed the impact of gadoxetic acid-enhanced MRI, ECCM-MRI, and CE-CT as first-line imaging modalities in patients with suspected colorectal cancer liver metastases (CRCLM).\n\nMethods: Conducted from October 2008 to September 2010 across 27 centres in eight countries, the trial included patients aged 18 years or older with suspected CRCLM. Participants were randomised 1:1:1 to receive gadoxetic acid-enhanced MRI, ECCM-MRI, or CE-CT. The primary outcome was the proportion of patients requiring further imaging for a confident diagnosis. Randomisation was performed using a computer-generated list with allocation concealment via sealed envelopes. Blinding was not implemented. The sample size was initially planned for 600 patients, with an interim analysis for potential adjustment.\n\nResults: A total of 360 patients were randomised, with 118, 112, and 112 patients in the gadoxetic acid-enhanced MRI, ECCM-MRI, and CE-CT groups, respectively. Efficacy was analysed in 342 patients. Further imaging was required in 0% of the gadoxetic acid-enhanced MRI group, 17.0% of the ECCM-MRI group, and 39.3% of the CE-CT group (P < 0.001). High or very high diagnostic confidence was achieved in 98.3% of the gadoxetic acid-enhanced MRI group, 85.7% of the ECCM-MRI group, and 65.2% of the CE-CT group. Surgical plans were altered in 28%, 32%, and 47% of patients, respectively. No adverse events were reported.\n\nInterpretation: Gadoxetic acid-enhanced MRI demonstrated superior diagnostic performance compared to ECCM-MRI and CE-CT, eliminating the need for further imaging. The study highlights the potential of gadoxetic acid-enhanced MRI to improve surgical planning and reduce intraoperative modifications. Trial registration: NCT00764621; EudraCT: 2008-000583-16.
