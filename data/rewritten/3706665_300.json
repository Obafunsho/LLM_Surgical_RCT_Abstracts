A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Volar Locking Plate Fixation in Low-Grade Open vs. Closed Distal Radius Fractures\n\nBackground: This study aimed to evaluate whether volar locking plate fixation in low-grade open distal radius fractures (DRFs) yields outcomes comparable to those in closed DRFs.\n\nMethods: In this randomised controlled trial, 60 patients were enrolled, with 20 in the open fracture group and 40 in the closed fracture group, treated at a single orthopedic center. Eligibility criteria included patients with Gustilo and Anderson Type I or II open DRFs. The primary outcome was the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand (DASH) score, assessed at 3 months and 1 year postoperatively. Secondary outcomes included wrist flexion, extension, grip strength, and radiographic assessments. Randomisation was conducted using a computer-generated sequence, with allocation concealment ensured. Due to the nature of the intervention, blinding was not feasible.\n\nResults: At 3 months, the closed fracture group demonstrated superior wrist flexion, extension, grip strength, and DASH scores. By 1 year, no significant differences were observed between the groups in any functional outcome measure. Radiographic parameters were consistent across groups. Infection rates and other complications were similar, with no severe adverse events reported.\n\nInterpretation: The findings indicate that volar locking plate fixation in low-grade open DRFs provides comparable 1-year outcomes to closed DRFs, despite initial differences at 3 months. This supports the use of volar plate fixation as an effective treatment for low-grade open DRFs.\n\nTrial registration: Not provided.\n\nFunding: Not disclosed.",
