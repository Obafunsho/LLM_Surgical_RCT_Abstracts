A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Feasibility of Systemic Lidocaine Infusion in Surgical ICU: A Pilot Study\n\nBackground: Systemic lidocaine infusion is a potential opioid-sparing analgesic strategy for critically ill surgical patients, but its feasibility and safety remain underexplored.\n\nMethods: This single-center, prospective, single-arm pilot trial was conducted at the surgical ICU of Houston Methodist Hospital. Twelve adult patients admitted after open abdominal surgery were enrolled. A low-dose lidocaine infusion (10–30 mcg/kg/min) was initiated within 1 hour of ICU admission. The primary outcome was feasibility, assessed through recruitment, retention, and withdrawal rates over a 6-month period. Safety outcomes included adverse events and serum lidocaine levels.\n\nResults: Eighteen participants were screened, with 12 completing the study, resulting in a 66.7% retention rate. No serious adverse events were reported. Dizziness and hypertension were the most common adverse events, affecting 16.7% of patients each. Four patients (33%) had elevated lidocaine levels (>5 mcg/mL) without clinical toxicity. Opioid requirements decreased from 22.6 MMEs on postoperative day 0 to 2.5 on day 3. Pain scores decreased by 1.09 units per day (β = −1.09; 95% CI: −1.82 to −0.36; p = 0.003).\n\nInterpretation: The study demonstrates the feasibility of a larger RCT to evaluate systemic lidocaine infusion in surgical ICUs, with minor adjustments to eligibility criteria and improved multidisciplinary collaboration. Trial registration: NCT06725485. Funding: Not specified. The absence of a control group limits the robustness of these findings, emphasizing the need for a randomized controlled trial to draw definitive conclusions regarding safety and efficacy. The study adhered to the CONSORT 2010 extension for pilot and feasibility trials, with no formal hypothesis testing for efficacy performed.",
