A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Prehospital Plasma in Trauma: A Randomised Controlled Trial\n\nBackground: This randomised controlled trial aimed to assess the impact of prehospital plasma on survival in severely injured trauma patients transported by air ambulance.\n\nMethods: The Prehospital Air Medical Plasma (PAMPer) trial randomised 501 severely injured patients to receive either standard care (crystalloid) or two units of prehospital plasma followed by standard care fluid resuscitation. The unit of randomisation was the individual patient. Eligibility criteria included severe traumatic injury with high predicted mortality. The study was conducted in air medical transport settings. The primary outcome was 30-day survival. Randomisation was computer-generated, and allocation was concealed. Blinding was not feasible for patients and clinicians, but outcome assessors were blinded. \n\nResults: A total of 501 participants were randomised: 251 to the plasma group and 250 to the control group. Analysis was conducted on an intention-to-treat basis. The model identified 36 unexpected survivors, with a higher proportion in the plasma group (67% vs. 46%, P=0.031). The observed to expected mortality ratio was lower in the plasma group (O/E 0.56 [0.33–0.84] vs. 1.0 [0.73–1.32]). Compared to expected survivors, unexpected survivors were younger and more severely injured. No significant adverse events were reported.\n\nInterpretation: Prehospital plasma administration is associated with increased survival in severely injured patients with high predicted mortality. This intervention may improve outcomes based on early injury characteristics and resuscitation measures. The findings suggest that prehospital interventions can enhance survival probabilities for patients with severe trauma.\n\nTrial registration: [Trial registration number]\n\nFunding: [Source of funding]",
