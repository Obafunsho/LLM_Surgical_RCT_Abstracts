A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Multiplayer vs. Single-Player iVR Training for Surgical Skills Acquisition\n\nBackground: Effective teamwork in the operating room (OR) is associated with improved technical performance and clinical outcomes. This study investigates whether multiplayer immersive Virtual Reality (iVR) training is superior to single-player training for acquiring technical and nontechnical skills in complex surgery.\n\nMethods: This randomised controlled trial involved 40 participants, randomised using block randomisation in a 1:1 ratio to either individual or team iVR training. Conducted at Imperial College, London, from April to October 2021, the study included junior orthopedic surgical residents and novice scrub technicians. Participants underwent five iVR training sessions over six weeks, followed by a real-world assessment of anterior approach total hip arthroplasty on a high-fidelity model. The primary outcome was the Non-Operative Technical Skills for Surgeons (NOTSS) score, evaluated by two blinded assessors. Secondary outcomes included procedure duration and technical errors.\n\nResults: Team-trained participants outperformed individually trained participants in nontechnical skills (NOTSS: 13.1±1.5 vs 10.6±1.6, P = 0.002), completed procedures 33% faster (28.2 minutes ± 5.5 vs 41.8 ± 8.9, P < 0.001), and made fewer technical errors (10.4 ± 6.1 vs 22.6 ± 5.4, P < 0.001). No adverse events were reported. The analysis was conducted on all 40 participants using an intention-to-treat approach.\n\nInterpretation: Multiplayer iVR training significantly enhances nontechnical skills and procedural efficiency, indicating potential for improved surgical outcomes. These findings support the integration of team-based iVR training in surgical education. Trial registration: ISRCTN32225943. Funding: Not specified.",
