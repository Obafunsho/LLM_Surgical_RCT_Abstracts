A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Tissue Adhesive in Bilateral Total Knee Arthroplasty\n\nBackground: Prolonged wound drainage after total knee arthroplasty (TKA) increases infection risk. This study evaluates the effect of high-viscosity tissue adhesive on postoperative wound drainage and healing in a fast-track TKA setting.\n\nMethods: This randomised controlled trial included 30 patients undergoing simultaneous bilateral TKA. The left knee was randomised to receive either standard three-layer closure with staples or the same closure supplemented with tissue adhesive, with the opposite treatment on the contralateral knee. One patient was excluded, leaving 29 patients (58 knees) for analysis. The primary outcome was the number of dressing changes in the first 72 hours postoperatively. The secondary outcome was wound healing assessed by the ASEPSIS score at 3 weeks. Nurses changing dressings were blinded to treatment allocation.\n\nResults: Knees with tissue adhesive had fewer dressing changes (median, 0; IQR, 0-1) compared to the control (IQR, 1-2; p = 0.001). In the intervention group, 59% of knees required no dressing changes before discharge, compared to 24% in the control group (p = 0.02). ASEPSIS scores at 3 weeks showed no significant difference between groups.\n\nInterpretation: Tissue adhesive reduced dressing changes post-TKA but did not affect wound healing at 3 weeks. Further research is needed to assess cost-effectiveness and long-term outcomes. No adverse events were reported. Trial registration and funding details are not provided.",
