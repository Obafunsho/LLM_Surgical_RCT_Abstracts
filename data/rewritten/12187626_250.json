This study evaluates an innovative RCA technique using Ion Exchange Resin (i-ER) for high blood flow (500 mL/min) extracorporeal circuits.\n\nMethods: Six healthy swine (41.0 ± 3.1 kg) were sedated, ventilated, and connected to a prototype extracorporeal circuit. Sodium citrate (5 mmol/L) was infused at the circuit inlet, and heparin was continuously infused. Citrate concentration and Kaolin Heparinase thromboelastography (KH-TEG) were measured at baseline, 2, 8, 15, 30, 45, 60, 90, and 120 min. Calcium chloride was infused to maintain systemic ionized calcium. The primary outcome was the efficacy of i-ER in maintaining anticoagulation, measured over 2 hours.\n\nResults: KH-TEG in the artery showed normal coagulation (R = 8.30[6.80–10.10] min, MA = 71.70[67.90–77.00] mm), while the extracorporeal circuit showed no clot formation (R > 60 min, MA = 0 mm). Citrate removal efficacy decreased from 93.8 ± 3.4% to 48.3 ± 1.5% over 2 hours (p < 0.001). No significant complications were observed.\n\nInterpretation: i-ER-based RCA is feasible and effective for regional anticoagulation in high blood flow circuits for 60 minutes. Further studies are needed for long-term applications.\n\nTrial registration: Not provided.\n\nFunding: Not specified.",
