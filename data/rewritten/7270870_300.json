A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Two-Stage Turnbull-Cutait Pull-Through vs. Standard Coloanal Anastomosis\n\nBackground: The two-stage Turnbull-Cutait pull-through hand-sewn coloanal anastomosis may offer benefits in reducing postoperative morbidity compared to the standard hand-sewn coloanal anastomosis with diverting ileostomy in patients undergoing surgery for low rectal cancer.\n\nMethods: This multicenter randomised clinical trial was conducted at Bellvitge University Hospital, Valle d’Hebron University Hospital in Spain, and Instituto Nazionale Tumori Fondazione G. Pascale in Italy. Patients eligible for ultralow anterior rectal resection were randomised to either the two-stage Turnbull-Cutait pull-through or standard hand-sewn coloanal anastomosis with diverting ileostomy. Randomisation was performed using a computer-generated sequence, with allocation concealment. Neither patients nor surgeons were blinded. The primary outcome was 30-day postoperative morbidity, including complications from ileostomy closure in the standard group. Data were collected from June 2012 to October 2018.\n\nResults: Ninety-two patients were randomised, with 46 in each group. The 30-day postoperative complication rate was 34.8% in the two-stage group and 45.7% in the standard group (difference = -10.9, 95% CI, -29.5 to 8.9; P = .40). Seven patients in the standard group did not undergo ileostomy reversal, and one patient in the two-stage group did not undergo delayed anastomosis. Analysis was conducted on an intention-to-treat basis. Adverse events were not specified.\n\nInterpretation: The two-stage pull-through hand-sewn coloanal anastomosis is safe and does not increase postoperative morbidity compared to the standard approach with diverting ileostomy.
