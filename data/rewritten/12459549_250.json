This meta-analysis aimed to compare the clinical outcomes of these two techniques.\n\nMethods: We included six studies, comprising both randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies, comparing conventional and no-touch techniques for AVF creation. The primary outcome was the primary patency rate from 6 months to 2 years. Data were analyzed using Review Manager Version 5.3.\n\nResults: A total of 699 patients were included, with 360 in the conventional group and 339 in the no-touch group. The primary patency rate was significantly higher in the no-touch group (OR 0.46, 95% CI 0.31–0.68; P < 0.0001). There were no significant differences in the success rate of surgery (OR 0.38, 95% CI 0.09–1.60; P = 0.19), maturation rate at 3 months (OR 0.53, 95% CI 0.24–1.18; P = 0.12), or secondary patency rate within 6 months to 1 year (OR 0.41, 95% CI 0.17–0.99; P = 0.05).\n\nInterpretation: The no-touch technique may offer a higher primary patency rate for AVF creation compared to the conventional technique. However, no significant differences were observed in other outcomes. Further large-scale RCTs are needed to confirm these findings.",
