A 250-word version\n\nTitle: BARI-OPTIMISE: A Randomised Controlled Trial\n\nBackground: Metabolic surgery can lead to variable weight loss outcomes, with poor weight loss linked to lower GLP-1 levels. This study evaluates the efficacy and safety of liraglutide, 3.0 mg, in patients with poor weight loss and suboptimal GLP-1 response post-surgery.\n\nMethods: In this double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trial, 70 adults with ≤20% weight loss post-RYGB or SG and suboptimal GLP-1 response were recruited from two London hospitals between October 2018 and November 2019. Participants were randomised 1:1 to liraglutide, 3.0 mg, or placebo, with a 500-kcal daily energy deficit. Randomisation was computer-generated, stratified by surgery type and diabetes status, with allocation concealed. All participants and study personnel were blinded. The primary outcome was percentage body weight change from baseline to 24 weeks, analysed by intention-to-treat.\n\nResults: Of 70 randomised (35 per group), 57 completed follow-up. Mean percentage weight change was −8.82% (SD 4.94) with liraglutide vs −0.54% (SD 3.32) with placebo. The mean difference was −8.03% (95% CI, −10.39 to −5.66; P < 0.001). Adverse events were more frequent with liraglutide (80%) than placebo (57%), predominantly gastrointestinal, with no serious events or deaths.\n\nInterpretation: Liraglutide, 3.0 mg, significantly reduced body weight compared to placebo in patients with poor weight loss post-surgery, supporting its use as an adjunct therapy.\n\nTrial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03341429\n\nFunding: Not specified.",
