A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Ceramic-on-Ceramic vs. Metal-on-Polyethylene Bearings in Total Hip Arthroplasty\n\nBackground: This study evaluates the long-term survivorship and osteolysis incidence of ceramic-on-ceramic bearings compared to metal-on-polyethylene bearings in total hip arthroplasty.\n\nMethods: In a multicenter randomised controlled trial, 189 patients (216 hips) were enrolled and randomised to receive either alumina ceramic bearings (144 hips) or cobalt chrome-on-polyethylene bearings (72 hips). The trial was conducted across five sites by five surgeons. The primary outcome was the survivorship of the bearing surface and implant systems over a minimum of 10 years, with an average follow-up of 10.3 years. Randomisation was performed using a computer-generated sequence, and allocation was concealed. Blinding was not specified.\n\nResults: The Kaplan-Meier survivorship analysis showed no significant difference in bearing-related failures between the ceramic (99.1%) and control groups (98.9%). Revisions for any reason were lower in the ceramic group (3.1%) compared to the control group (10.5%). Osteolysis was observed in 26% of the control group and none in the ceramic group. Squeaking occurred in 1.4% of the ceramic group. All femoral implants remained well fixed, with one acetabular component unstable in the control group.\n\nInterpretation: Ceramic-on-ceramic bearings demonstrated superior outcomes in terms of revision rates and osteolysis compared to metal-on-polyethylene bearings at 10 years. These findings support the use of ceramic bearings in younger, more active patients. Trial registration and funding details were not provided.",
