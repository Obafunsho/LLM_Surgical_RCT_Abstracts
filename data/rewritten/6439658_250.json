A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Prophylactic Intraperitoneal Mesh Implantation in Abdominal Surgery: A Randomised Controlled Trial\n\nBackground: Incisional hernia is a common complication post-abdominal surgery. Prophylactic mesh implantation may reduce hernia incidence but could lead to wound complications.\n\nMethods: This open-label randomised controlled trial was conducted at Bern University Hospital, Switzerland, from January 1, 2011, to February 29, 2014. Eligible participants had two or more risk factors: overweight/obesity, neoplastic disease, male sex, or previous laparotomy. Patients were randomised to intraperitoneal mesh implantation or standard closure. The primary outcome was incisional hernia incidence at 3 years. Randomisation was performed using a computer-generated sequence, with allocation concealment by sealed envelopes. Blinding was not applied.\n\nResults: Of 169 patients, 150 were analysed (69 mesh, 81 control). The mesh group had a lower hernia incidence (7.2% vs 18.5%, P = .03). Early postoperative pain was higher in the mesh group at 6 weeks (65% vs 44%, P = .04) but not at later follow-ups. No difference in surgical site infections was noted, but wound healing was longer in the mesh group (8 vs 5 weeks, P = .03). Trunk extension was reduced in the mesh group (1.73 cm vs 2.40 cm, P = .009).\n\nInterpretation: Prophylactic intraperitoneal mesh reduces hernia incidence in high-risk patients but increases early pain and prolongs wound healing.
