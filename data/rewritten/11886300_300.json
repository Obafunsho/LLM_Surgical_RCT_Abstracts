This study aimed to assess the incidence, clinical features, and outcomes of VTE following LT.\n\nMethods: Conducted as a randomised controlled trial at a tertiary care hospital, the study included patients undergoing LT, aged over 18, and without pre-existing VTE. Participants were randomised into two groups: the intervention group received standard VTE prophylaxis, while the control group received extended prophylaxis. Randomisation was computer-generated, and allocation concealment was ensured using sealed envelopes. Outcome assessors were blinded to group assignments.\n\nResults: A total of 200 participants were randomised: 100 to the intervention group and 100 to the control group, recruited between January 2020 and June 2021. The primary outcome was the incidence of VTE within 90 days post-LT. The intervention group showed a VTE incidence of 15%, compared to 25% in the control group (risk difference = -10%, 95% CI -18% to -2%; p = 0.02). Adverse events occurred in 5% of the intervention group and 8% of the control group, with no severe events reported. Analysis was conducted on an intention-to-treat basis.\n\nInterpretation: The study demonstrated that extended VTE prophylaxis significantly reduces the incidence of VTE in LT patients without increasing severe adverse events. These results advocate for the implementation of extended prophylaxis in clinical practice for LT patients to improve outcomes.\n\nTrial registration: NCT12345678\n\nFunding: The trial was funded by the National Institutes of Health.",
