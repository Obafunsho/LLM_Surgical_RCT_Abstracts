A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial on the Influence of Physician and Patient Race on Surgical Decision-Making\n\nBackground: Racial disparities in surgical therapy for lung cancer exist in the United States. This study investigates whether physician and standardized patient (SP) race in videos influence surgeon decision-making.\n\nMethods: This randomised controlled trial involved thoracic surgeons and trainees who read race-neutral vignettes paired with videos of SPs randomized to black or white. The primary outcome was the change in risk estimation for major surgical complications, measured immediately after video viewing. Participants were recruited from various U.S. medical centers. Randomisation was computer-generated, and allocation was concealed. Blinding was not applicable as participants viewed videos.\n\nResults: A total of 113 surgeons (38 practicing, 75 trainees) participated, with 76 identifying as white non-Hispanic. The percentage change in risk estimates was not significantly related to patient race (p = 0.11) or surgeon race (p = 0.52). Videos of black SPs were associated with a similar likelihood of recommending surgery compared to white SPs (p = 0.90). Physician race did not influence surgical recommendations (p = 0.79). No adverse events were reported.\n\nInterpretation: Neither patient nor physician race significantly affected risk estimation or surgical recommendations. These findings do not explain racial disparities in lung cancer therapy. Further research is needed to identify underlying mechanisms. Trial registration: [Trial registration number].
