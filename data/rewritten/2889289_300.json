Randomization was centralized by the EORTC headquarters and stratified by institution. The primary outcome was the sentinel node identification rate, measured at the time of surgery. The study was conducted in 26 European institutions between 2001 and 2005. The analysis was performed on 1,953 eligible patients using an intention-to-treat approach.\n\nResults: The sentinel node identification rate was 97% (1,888/1,953). Factors affecting the success rate included age, tumor size, histology, year of accrual, and detection method. SNB results were negative in 65% (1,220/1,888) of patients, who received no further axillary treatment. Positive SNB results were found in 34% (647/1,888), with further nodal involvement in 41% of macrometastases, and 18% in both micrometastases and isolated tumor cells. No adverse events related to the SNB procedure were reported.\n\nInterpretation: The SNB procedure is highly effective with a 97% detection rate, particularly using the combined method. Further nodal involvement was similar for micrometastases and isolated tumor cells at 18%. The trial provides evidence for the effectiveness of SNB in axillary staging and treatment planning.\n\nTrial registration: EORTC 10981-22023 AMAROS.\n\nFunding: Not specified.",
