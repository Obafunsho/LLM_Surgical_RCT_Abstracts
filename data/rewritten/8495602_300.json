This study evaluates the impact of PTR on 60-day mortality.\n\nMethods: CAIRO4 is a multicenter, randomised phase 3 trial conducted by the Danish and Dutch Colorectal Cancer Group in general and academic hospitals in Denmark and the Netherlands. Patients with histologically confirmed mCRC, unresectable metastases, and minimal symptoms were randomised to receive either systemic treatment only or PTR followed by systemic treatment. The primary outcome was 60-day mortality. Randomisation was computer-generated, and allocation was concealed. Blinding was not applicable.\n\nResults: Between August 2012 and December 2019, 196 patients were randomised, with 98 assigned to each group. In the intention-to-treat analysis, 60-day mortality was 3% (95% CI, 1%-9%) in the systemic treatment group and 11% (95% CI, 6%-19%) in the PTR group (P = .03). Per-protocol analysis showed 60-day mortality of 2% (95% CI, 1%-7%) vs 10% (95% CI, 5%-18%; P = .048). Patients with elevated serum levels of lactate dehydrogenase, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, and/or neutrophils had significantly higher mortality in the PTR group.\n\nInterpretation: PTR followed by systemic treatment was associated with higher 60-day mortality compared to systemic treatment alone. Elevated serum markers identified patients at increased risk of postoperative mortality. Further research is required to evaluate overall survival outcomes.\n\nTrial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01606098\n\nFunding: Not specified.",
