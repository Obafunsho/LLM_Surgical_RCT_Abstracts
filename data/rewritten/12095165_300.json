The primary outcomes were all-cause mortality and cardiovascular mortality, assessed over a follow-up period. Randomisation methods and allocation concealment varied across studies, and blinding details were inconsistently reported. The analysis was conducted using a random-effects model.\n\nResults: A+T was associated with a decreased risk of all-cause mortality (OR=0.47, 95% CI 0.31–0.70, p<0.001) and cardiovascular mortality (OR=0.50, 95% CI 0.31–0.82, p=0.006) compared to A+C. No significant difference was observed in major bleeding rates (OR=1.16; 95% CI 0.69–1.96; p=0.57). Other outcomes, including MACCEs, myocardial infarction, stroke, total graft occlusion, revascularization, and saphenous vein occlusion, were comparable between groups. Adverse events were not consistently reported across studies.\n\nInterpretation: The meta-analysis provides evidence supporting the use of A+T post-CABG to reduce all-cause and cardiovascular mortality without increasing bleeding events compared to A+C. However, the variability in study design and reporting highlights the need for further randomised controlled trials to confirm these findings and establish the optimal DAPT strategy post-CABG.
