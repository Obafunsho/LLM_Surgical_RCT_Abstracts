Participants were randomly assigned to receive multiple focused ultrasound exposures using a hemispherical phased array transducer with patient-specific treatment planning. The primary outcome was the ability to achieve controlled and precise thermal ablation in the brain, assessed through MR temperature imaging. Randomisation was conducted using a computer-generated sequence, and allocation was concealed using sealed envelopes. Blinding was not applicable due to the nature of the intervention.\n\nResults: The study demonstrated the feasibility of focusing an ultrasound beam transcranially into the brain and visualizing the heating with MR temperature imaging. Although limited by device power, extrapolation of temperature measurements suggested potential for thermal ablation without overheating the brain surface. No adverse events were reported.\n\nInterpretation: These findings represent a significant step towards a noninvasive alternative to surgical resection for brain disorders. Further studies with enhanced device power are needed to confirm the potential for thermal coagulation.\n\nTrial registration: [Trial registration number]\n\nFunding: This trial was funded by [source of funding].",
