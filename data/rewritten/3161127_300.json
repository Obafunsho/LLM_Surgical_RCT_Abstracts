The primary outcome was the incidence of low cardiac output syndrome or death 36 hours postoperatively. Secondary outcomes included death at 30 days, interleukin-6 levels, inotropic score, fluid balance, serum creatinine, and ICU and hospital stay. Randomisation was performed using a computer-generated sequence, and allocation was concealed. Blinding included patients, clinicians, and outcome assessors. The study was conducted at [study setting]. Eligibility criteria included [participant eligibility criteria].\n\nResults: Preoperative interleukin-6 levels were reduced by 2-fold (p<0.001) in the Two Dose group, consistent with the anti-inflammatory effects of methylprednisolone. The incidence of low cardiac output syndrome was 46% in the Single Dose and 38% in the Two Dose groups (p=0.51). Two Dose methylprednisolone was associated with higher serum creatinine (0.61±0.18 vs. 0.53±0.12 mg/dL, p=0.03) and poorer postoperative diuresis (−96±49 mL, p=0.05). No significant differences were observed in inotropic requirement, duration of mechanical ventilation, ICU, and hospital stay. Adverse events included [adverse events details].\n\nInterpretation: Combined preoperative and intraoperative glucocorticoid use does not improve early clinical outcomes and may exacerbate renal dysfunction.
