A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Oliceridine vs. Morphine for Postoperative GI Tolerability\n\nBackground: This study assesses the gastrointestinal (GI) tolerability of oliceridine, a G-protein selective µ-opioid receptor agonist, compared to morphine in patients with moderate-to-severe acute pain following bunionectomy or abdominoplasty.\n\nMethods: Conducted as two randomised, double-blind, placebo- and morphine-controlled phase 3 trials, patients aged 18-75 years with Apfel scores ≥3 were randomised to receive oliceridine (0.1, 0.35, 0.5 mg) or morphine (1 mg) via patient-controlled analgesia. The primary outcome was \"complete GI response,\" defined as no vomiting and no use of rescue antiemetics, measured over 48 hours for bunionectomy and 24 hours for abdominoplasty. Randomisation was computer-generated, with allocation concealed using sealed envelopes. Patients, clinicians, and outcome assessors were blinded.\n\nResults: A total of 756 patients were randomised: 378 to oliceridine and 378 to morphine, between January 2018 and December 2019. In the unadjusted analysis, complete GI response was significantly higher with oliceridine 0.1 mg (68.0%) and 0.35 mg (46.2%) compared to morphine (30.8%), p ≤ 0.005. Adjusted analysis showed odds ratios of 3.14 (95% CI: 1.78, 5.56; p < 0.0001) for bunionectomy and 1.92 (95% CI: 1.09, 3.36; p = 0.024) for abdominoplasty. No severe adverse events were reported, with mild GI side-effects in 3% of the oliceridine group and 1% of the morphine group.\n\nInterpretation: Oliceridine demonstrated better GI tolerability than morphine, with reduced vomiting and need for rescue antiemetics. These findings suggest oliceridine as a viable option for postoperative pain management with improved GI safety. Trial registration: NCT02335294. Funding: Trevena, Inc.",
