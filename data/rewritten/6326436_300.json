A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Papaverine Concentrations for Vasospasm Prevention in Radial Artery Grafts\n\nBackground: This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of two papaverine concentrations (0.5 mg/ml and 2 mg/ml) for preventing vasospasm and their impact on endothelial integrity in radial artery (RA) grafts used in coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery.\n\nMethods: In a randomised controlled trial conducted at John Paul II Hospital, RA segments were harvested from 10 CABG patients. The segments were randomly assigned to two groups: 0.5 mg/ml papaverine (n=12) and 2 mg/ml papaverine (n=12). The primary outcome was the vasodilatory effect, assessed using ex vivo myography over 60 minutes. Endothelial integrity was evaluated by measuring the percentage of vessel circumference positive for CD34. Randomisation was achieved using a computer-generated sequence, and allocation was concealed. Blinding was not applicable.\n\nResults: The 2 mg/ml papaverine group demonstrated stronger vasodilatation (mean difference = 24.67%, 95% CI 15.23 to 34.11; p < 0.001) but caused more endothelial damage (mean difference = 22.63%, 95% CI 8.91 to 36.35; p = 0.002) compared to the 0.5 mg/ml group. Response to KCl was 7.35±3.33 mN for vessels treated with 0.5 mg/ml and 2.66±1.96 mN for 2 mg/ml. No adverse events were reported.\n\nInterpretation: Although 2 mg/ml papaverine provided superior vasodilatation, it resulted in significant endothelial damage. The 0.5 mg/ml concentration preserved endothelial integrity better, suggesting it may be more suitable for RA grafts in CABG.\n\nTrial registration: Not provided.\n\nFunding: Not reported.",
