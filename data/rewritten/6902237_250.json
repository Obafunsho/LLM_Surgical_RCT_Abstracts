A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial on the Effectiveness of Cognitive Aids in Surgical Settings\n\nBackground: Failure to rescue in surgical patients is often due to human error, which can be mitigated by cognitive aids. This study evaluates the effectiveness of cognitive aids in improving adherence to best practices in managing deteriorating postoperative patients.\n\nMethods: This randomised clinical trial was conducted in a simulation setting with surgical teams from four hospitals in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. Each team consisted of one surgeon and two nurses. Participants were eligible if they were part of a surgical ward team. Teams were randomised to manage three simulated deteriorating patient scenarios with or without cognitive aids. Randomisation was computer-generated, and allocation was concealed. Blinding was not applicable due to the nature of the intervention. The primary outcome was the percentage of omitted critical management steps, measured immediately after each scenario. The secondary outcome was the perceived usability of cognitive aids.\n\nResults: Fifty surgical teams were randomised, with 25 teams in each group. A total of 93 women and 51 men participated. Using cognitive aids reduced omitted critical management steps from 33% to 10% (70% reduction, P < .001). Multivariate analysis confirmed this effect (odds ratio, 0.63; 95% CI, −0.228 to −0.061; P = .001). Usability was rated at a median of 8.7/10. No adverse events were reported.\n\nInterpretation: Cognitive aids significantly improve adherence to best practices in managing postoperative complications, potentially reducing failure to rescue.
