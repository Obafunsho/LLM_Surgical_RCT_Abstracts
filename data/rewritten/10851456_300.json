This study aims to assess the effectiveness of endoscopic pedicle SVG harvesting (Pedicle-EVH) in reducing wound complications while maintaining graft patency.\n\nMethods: This randomised controlled trial was conducted at our department from September 2019 to January 2023. Participants were patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) with SVGs. Eligibility criteria excluded patients with severe diabetes, age ≥80, and those requiring multivessel bypass. The intervention group underwent Pedicle-EVH, while the control group received conventional NT-SVG harvesting. The primary outcome was early graft patency, assessed via coronary computed tomographic angiography (CCTA) before hospital discharge. Randomisation was performed using a computer-generated sequence, with allocation concealment via sealed envelopes. Blinding was not applied to patients or clinicians.\n\nResults: A total of 148 patients were randomised: 72 to Pedicle-EVH and 76 to NT-SVG. Early patency was 95.8% in the Pedicle-EVH group, with 69 out of 72 patients showing patent grafts. No major wound complications were reported in the Pedicle-EVH group, while lymphorrhea occurred in 2/72 (2.8%) patients. Analysis was conducted per-protocol.\n\nInterpretation: The Pedicle-EVH technique demonstrated satisfactory early patency and reduced wound complications compared to NT-SVG. These findings suggest that Pedicle-EVH is a viable alternative to NT-SVG, though long-term outcomes require further monitoring.\n\nTrial registration: Not provided.\n\nFunding: The authors declare no conflicts of interest.",
