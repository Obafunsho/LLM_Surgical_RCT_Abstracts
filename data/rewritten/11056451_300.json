A 300-word version\n\nTitle: A Review of Randomised Controlled Trials in Thoracic Surgical Oncology\n\nBackground: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) are considered the highest level of evidence, yet their implementation in thoracic surgical oncology is not well described. This study aims to understand the types of RCTs conducted in thoracic surgical oncology and their success rates.\n\nMethods: The ClinicalTrials.gov database was queried in April 2023 to identify RCTs in patients with lung cancer undergoing surgery. Inclusion criteria were \"lung neoplasm\" as a MESH term and surgical-related keywords. Exclusion criteria included non-randomised trials and those with non-surgical primary outcomes. The cohort was stratified by trial status, and characteristics were extracted, including start and completion dates, masking, and enrollment numbers.\n\nResults: Sixty-eight RCTs met the criteria; 33 (48.5%) focused on perioperative management or intraoperative techniques. Forty-four (64.7%) were open-label, 43 (63.2%) were single-center, and 66 (97.1%) had two arms. The mean enrollment was 236 patients (SD, 187). Of 21 completed RCTs (31%), the average time to complete accrual was 1605 days (4.4 years), and the average time to complete outcomes collection was 2125 days (5.82 years). The mean actual enrollment was lower than anticipated, with a 26% reduction in actual enrollment.\n\nInterpretation: The findings suggest a need to scrutinize future RCT proposals to assess the likelihood of successful completion. The study highlights the challenges in conducting surgical RCTs, including long completion times and low completion rates. Future research should focus on understanding factors contributing to RCT success or failure, such as enrollment challenges and trial design.\n\nTrial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov\n\nFunding: Not specified.",
