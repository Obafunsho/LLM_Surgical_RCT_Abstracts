A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Perioperative 5-FU in Colon Cancer\n\nBackground: This phase III randomised controlled trial assessed the impact of perioperative fluorouracil (5-FU) on overall survival (OS) in patients with colon cancer.\n\nMethods: Conducted by the NCI Intergroup, the trial randomised patients with newly diagnosed, nonmetastatic adenocarcinoma of the colon to receive either continuous infusional 5-FU for 7 days starting within 24 hours after curative resection (arm A) or no perioperative 5-FU (arm B). The primary endpoint was OS in patients with Dukes’ B3 and C disease. Randomisation was performed using permutated blocks with dynamic balancing. The trial was open-label with no blinding. The study was conducted across multiple institutions, and the sample size calculation aimed for 800 patients with Dukes’ B3 and C disease.\n\nResults: From August 1993 to May 2000, 855 patients were randomised (arm A: 427; arm B: 428). The trial was terminated early due to slow accrual. Among patients with Dukes’ B3 and C disease, there was no significant difference in OS [median 10.3 years (95% CI 8.4, 13.2) for arm A and 9.3 years (95% CI 5.7, 12.3) for arm B, p = 0.178]. For Dukes’ B2 disease, no significant difference in OS was observed. Eighteen percent of arm A patients experienced grade 3 or greater toxicity, while no significant differences in operative complications were noted between the groups.\n\nInterpretation: Perioperative 5-FU was well tolerated but did not significantly improve OS or DFS in patients with Dukes’ B2, B3, and C colon cancer. The trial was not registered, and funding was provided by the NCI Intergroup. Further research is needed to determine the optimal timing of adjuvant chemotherapy in colon cancer.",
