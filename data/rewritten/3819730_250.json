This study aimed to determine the association between the duration of AKI and long-term survival. \n\nMethods: This was a retrospective cohort study involving 4,987 cardiac surgery patients from 2002 to 2007 at a medical center in northern New England. AKI was defined as a ≥0.3 mg/dL or ≥50% increase in serum creatinine from baseline and classified into AKI network stages. Duration of AKI was categorized as no AKI, AKI for 1–2, 3–6, and ≥7 days. \n\nResults: 39% of patients developed AKI. Long-term survival differed significantly by AKI duration (p < 0.001). Adjusted hazard ratios (HR) for mortality, with no AKI as the referent, were: 1–2 days (18%, HR 1.66; 95% CI 1.32–2.09), 3–6 days (11%, HR 1.94; 95% CI 1.51–2.49), and ≥7 days (9%, HR 3.40; 95% CI 2.73–4.25). This relationship persisted when excluding in-hospital deaths (p < 0.001). Propensity-matched analysis confirmed these results. \n\nInterpretation: The duration of AKI after cardiac surgery is directly proportional to long-term mortality. This dose-dependent effect on mortality highlights the importance of AKI duration in patient care, aiding clinicians in evaluating the risk of in-hospital and post-discharge death.",
