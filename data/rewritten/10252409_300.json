A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of PET-CT in Locally Advanced Esophageal Adenocarcinoma\n\nBackground: Esophageal adenocarcinoma, including gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma, is associated with a poor prognosis. PET-CT has emerged as a key tool in managing this disease. This study evaluates the role of PET-CT in staging, prognostication, and therapy adaptation.\n\nMethods: This randomised controlled trial was conducted at multiple centers. Participants were adults with locally advanced esophageal adenocarcinoma. Eligibility criteria included histologically confirmed adenocarcinoma and suitability for neoadjuvant therapy. The intervention group received PET-CT-adapted therapy, while the control group received standard care. The primary outcome was progression-free survival over 24 months. Randomisation was computer-generated, with allocation concealment via sealed envelopes. Blinding was applied to outcome assessors.\n\nResults: A total of 200 participants were randomised: 100 to the intervention and 100 to the control group, between January 2020 and June 2021. Analysis included 98 in the intervention group and 97 in the control group, using an intention-to-treat approach. The intervention group showed improved progression-free survival (mean difference = 5.2 months, 95% CI 3.1 to 7.3; p = 0.01). Adverse events were mild, with 3% in the intervention group and 1% in the control group experiencing gastrointestinal side-effects. The intervention group also demonstrated a higher rate of pathologic complete response compared to the control group.\n\nInterpretation: PET-CT-adapted therapy significantly improves progression-free survival and pathologic complete response rates in locally advanced esophageal adenocarcinoma. The trial supports the integration of PET-CT in treatment planning, offering a potential strategy to enhance patient outcomes.\n\nTrial registration: NCT12345678\n\nFunding: Supported by the National Cancer Institute.",
