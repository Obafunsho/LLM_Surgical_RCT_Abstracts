A 250-word version\n\nTitle: A Randomised Controlled Trial Comparing Standard and Long Intramedullary Hip Nails for Reverse Obliquity Fractures\n\nBackground: Reverse obliquity fractures of the proximal femur present unique biomechanical challenges and high implant failure rates with sliding hip screws. Intramedullary hip nailing may reduce lag screw cut-out risk, but the impact of nail length on healing is unclear.\n\nMethods: This pilot prospective randomised controlled trial was conducted from January 2009 to December 2009. Participants were patients with reverse obliquity fractures of the proximal femur, treated at a single institution. Eligibility criteria included age 67-95 years. Patients were randomised to receive either standard or long (≥34 cm) intramedullary hip nails. The primary outcome was reoperation rate due to fixation failure, assessed over a minimum follow-up of 12 months. Randomisation was performed using a computer-generated sequence, with allocation concealment ensured by sealed envelopes. Blinding was not applied.\n\nResults: Thirty-three patients were randomised: 15 to standard nails and 18 to long nails. Analysis was per-protocol. Reoperation rates showed no significant difference between groups. Two patients in the long-nail group required revision surgery. Mortality rates were 17% for standard nails and 18% for long nails. Parker-Palmer mobility and Harris hip scores, union rates, and adverse events were similar between groups.\n\nInterpretation: Both standard and long intramedullary nails are viable options for treating reverse obliquity fractures, with no significant differences in reoperation rates or functional outcomes. Further studies are needed to confirm these findings.\n\nTrial registration: Not provided.\n\nFunding: Not disclosed.",
