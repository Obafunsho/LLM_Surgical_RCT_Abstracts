A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Anorectal Function and Quality of Life After Chemoradiation and Local Excision in Early Rectal Cancer\n\nBackground: This study evaluates anorectal function and quality of life in T2N0 rectal cancer patients treated with chemoradiation followed by local excision, an alternative to total mesorectal excision.\n\nMethods: In this multicentric phase II trial (ACOSOG Z6041), patients with stage cT2N0 rectal adenocarcinomas were treated with an oxaliplatin/capecitabine-based chemoradiation regimen followed by local excision. Anorectal function and quality of life were assessed at enrollment and 1 year postoperatively using the Fecal Incontinence Severity Index, Fecal Incontinence Quality of Life scale, and Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Colorectal questionnaire. Randomisation and allocation concealment methods were not specified. Blinding details were not provided.\n\nResults: Seventy-one patients were evaluated at enrollment and 66 at 1 year. No significant differences were found in Fecal Incontinence Severity Index scores at 1 year. Fecal Incontinence Quality of Life results were significantly worse in lifestyle (p<0.001), coping/behavior (p<0.001), and embarrassment (p=0.002) domains. The Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy overall score showed no differences, but physical well-being was worse and emotional well-being improved. The original chemoradiation regimen predicted worse depression/self-perception and embarrassment scores, while male sex predicted worse overall scores.\n\nInterpretation: Chemoradiation followed by local excision had minimal impact on anorectal function 1 year post-surgery. Quality of life remained stable with mixed effects on subscales. This information aids in patient counseling. Limitations include small sample size and short follow-up. Trial registration and funding details were not provided.",
