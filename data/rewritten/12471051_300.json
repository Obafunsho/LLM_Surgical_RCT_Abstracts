A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Cannulation Strategies in Aortic Arch Surgery\n\nBackground: Aortic arch surgery, especially in acute type A aortic dissection (ATAAD), presents significant mortality and morbidity risks. This study aims to compare the efficacy of right axillary and innominate artery cannulation strategies for cerebral protection.\n\nMethods: Conducted across six Canadian centers, this randomised controlled trial included patients undergoing proximal aortic arch surgery. Eligibility criteria encompassed patients with ATAAD. Participants were randomised to either right axillary or innominate artery cannulation. Randomisation was computer-generated, and allocation concealment was achieved using sealed envelopes. Due to the nature of the intervention, blinding was not feasible.\n\nIntervention: Participants were assigned to right axillary artery cannulation (intervention) or innominate artery cannulation (control). The primary outcome was the incidence of new severe ischemic lesions, evaluated through diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging postoperatively.\n\nResults: A total of 222 participants were randomised, with 111 in each group. The analysis followed an intention-to-treat approach. The incidence of new severe ischemic lesions was comparable between the axillary group (34%) and the innominate group (38.8%). Thirty-day mortality rates and adverse events, including seizures and delirium, were similar across both groups. The study found no significant difference in the duration of mechanical ventilation between the two strategies.\n\nInterpretation: Both right axillary and innominate artery cannulation strategies offer similar neuroprotection in aortic arch surgery, although the incidence of new neurological lesions remains high. These findings suggest that both approaches are viable, but further research is necessary to refine cannulation strategies and improve patient outcomes.\n\nTrial registration: Not provided.\n\nFunding: Not specified.",
