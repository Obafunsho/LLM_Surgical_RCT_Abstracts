A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial on the Effectiveness of Cognitive Aids in Surgical Settings\n\nBackground: Human error contributes significantly to failure to rescue in surgical patients. Cognitive aids may reduce such errors. This study assesses the impact of cognitive aids on adherence to best practices in managing deteriorating postoperative patients.\n\nMethods: A randomised clinical trial was conducted in a simulation setting with surgical teams from four hospitals in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. Each team included one surgeon and two nurses. Eligibility required participants to be part of a surgical ward team. Teams were randomised to manage three simulated deteriorating patient scenarios with or without cognitive aids. Randomisation was computer-generated, and allocation was concealed. Blinding was not feasible due to the intervention's nature. The primary outcome was the percentage of omitted critical management steps, assessed immediately post-scenario. The secondary outcome was the usability of cognitive aids.\n\nResults: Fifty surgical teams were randomised, with 25 teams in each group. Participants included 93 women and 51 men. Cognitive aids reduced omitted critical management steps from 33% to 10%, a 70% reduction (P < .001). This effect was significant in multivariate analysis (odds ratio, 0.63; 95% CI, −0.228 to −0.061; P = .001). Usability was rated at a median of 8.7/10. No adverse events were reported.\n\nInterpretation: Cognitive aids significantly enhance adherence to best practices in managing postoperative complications, potentially reducing failure to rescue and improving patient outcomes. Trial Registration: NCT03812861. Funding: Not specified. This study highlights the potential of cognitive aids to improve surgical care quality and patient safety. Further research in clinical settings is warranted to confirm these findings.",
