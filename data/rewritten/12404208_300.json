A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Effects of Dexmedetomidine on Postoperative Recovery in Elderly TKA Patients: A Randomised Controlled Trial\n\nBackground: This study aimed to assess the impact of dexmedetomidine on postoperative quality of recovery (QoR) in elderly patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty (TKA) and to investigate the correlation with electroencephalogram (EEG) changes.\n\nMethods: Conducted at a tertiary hospital in China, this single-center, randomised controlled trial enrolled 225 patients aged 60 years or older undergoing elective TKA between December 2022 and June 2023. Participants were randomly assigned in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive 0.6 μg/kg/h dexmedetomidine (Group D2), 0.3 μg/kg/h dexmedetomidine (Group D1), or saline (Group N). The primary outcome was the QoR-15 score on postoperative day 1. Randomisation was achieved using a computer-generated sequence, and allocation was concealed. Blinding was maintained for patients, clinicians, and outcome assessors.\n\nResults: Of the 225 patients, 204 were included in the analysis. Group D2 demonstrated a significant improvement in QoR-15 scores on postoperative day 1 compared to Group N (median difference, 6 points; 95% CI, 4 to 8; P < 0.001) and Group D1 (median difference, 4 points; 95% CI, 2 to 5; P = 0.001). No significant differences were observed on postoperative day 3. Intraoperative EEG analysis showed increased slow oscillation peak power in Groups D1 and D2. Adverse events were similar across groups, with no significant differences in hypotension or bradycardia.\n\nInterpretation: A loading dose of dexmedetomidine followed by 0.6 μg/kg/h improved QoR-15 on postoperative day 1, potentially due to increased slow oscillation peak power. This study provides insights into anesthesia strategies for enhancing postoperative recovery in elderly TKA patients. Trial registration: ChiCTR2200066337. Funding: Not specified.",
