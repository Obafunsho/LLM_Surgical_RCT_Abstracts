A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial on the Efficacy of Cricoid Pressure during Rapid Sequence Induction\n\nBackground: Rapid sequence induction (RSI) is a technique used to secure airways in patients at risk of pulmonary aspiration. Cricoid pressure is applied to reduce aspiration risk by compressing the oesophagus.\n\nMethods: This randomised controlled trial included 40 participants undergoing elective surgery requiring general anaesthesia. Participants were randomly assigned to receive either cricoid pressure (n=20) or simulated cricoid pressure (n=20) during RSI. The primary outcome was the prevalence of aspiration, measured by visual inspection, pepsin detection, or radiographic changes. Randomisation was conducted using a computer-generated sequence, and allocation was concealed using sealed envelopes. Blinding was applied to outcome assessors.\n\nResults: The study found no significant difference in the primary outcome between the cricoid pressure and control groups. The effect size and precision were not reported. No adverse events were reported in either group.\n\nInterpretation: The trial did not provide evidence supporting the efficacy of cricoid pressure in reducing aspiration during RSI. Further well-designed RCTs are needed to assess the safety and effectiveness of cricoid pressure.\n\nTrial registration: Not provided.\n\nFunding: Not reported.",
