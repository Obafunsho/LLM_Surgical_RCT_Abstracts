A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial Comparing Intrathecal Hydromorphone and TAP Block for Postoperative Analgesia in Upper Abdominal Surgery\n\nBackground: Effective postoperative analgesia is crucial for recovery after upper abdominal surgery. This study compares the analgesic efficacy of intrathecal hydromorphone (ITH) and transversus abdominis plane (TAP) block.\n\nMethods: This retrospective study was conducted at West China Hospital, Sichuan University, involving patients aged 18-75 years undergoing elective upper abdominal surgeries between January and June 2023. Participants received either ITH or TAP block. The primary outcome was the incidence of moderate-to-severe pain during movement at 24 hours postoperatively. Secondary outcomes included pain at rest, complications, and rehabilitation indicators. Propensity score matching was used to minimize baseline differences.\n\nResults: A total of 182 patients were analyzed after matching, with 91 in each group. The ITH group had a lower incidence of moderate-to-severe pain during movement at 24 hours (27.5% vs. 44.0%; p = 0.02). Pruritus was more frequent in the ITH group (29.7% vs. 6.6%; p < 0.001). The TAP group experienced earlier first flatus (57.0 hours vs. 68.0 hours; p = 0.03). First-day morphine equivalent consumption was lower in the ITH group (12.3 mg vs. 15.0 mg; p = 0.01).\n\nInterpretation: ITH is more effective in reducing moderate-to-severe pain during movement within the first postoperative day. However, TAP block is associated with fewer adverse effects and faster gastrointestinal recovery. Further randomized controlled trials are needed to confirm these findings.\n\nTrial registration: ChiCTR2400079577.\n\nFunding: Not specified.",
