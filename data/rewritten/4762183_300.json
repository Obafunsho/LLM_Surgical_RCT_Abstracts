A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Impact of Patient Characteristics on Insulin Response During Non-Cardiac Surgery: A Randomised Controlled Trial\n\nBackground: Insulin response during surgery may be influenced by patient characteristics such as body weight and diabetes status. This study aimed to assess these effects in non-cardiac surgical patients.\n\nMethods: Conducted as part of the DeLiT Trial, this randomised controlled trial involved 202 patients undergoing non-cardiac surgery. Participants were randomised using a computer-generated sequence, with allocation concealed via sealed envelopes. Eligibility criteria included adult patients scheduled for non-cardiac surgery. The primary outcome was the change in blood glucose concentration 30 minutes after an initial insulin bolus. Blinding was applied to outcome assessors. The intervention involved intraoperative intravenous insulin administration, with no comparator group.\n\nResults: A total of 202 patients were randomised, with 101 in each group. Analysis was performed on all participants using an intention-to-treat approach. Blood glucose concentrations decreased by 8.3 ±10 mg dl-1 (0.46 ± 0.56 mmol litre-1) per unit of insulin. The response was similar in patients with and without diabetes [adjusted mean difference (97.5% CI): 0.2 (-3.9, 4.2) mg dl-1, 0.01 (-0.22, 0.24) mmol litre-1, P = 0.93]. No significant relationship was found between insulin response and body weight. No adverse events were reported.\n\nInterpretation: The results indicate that body weight and diabetes status do not significantly impact intraoperative insulin response, suggesting that adjustments for these factors may not be necessary in treatment algorithms. This could simplify insulin administration protocols during surgery.\n\nTrial registration: [Trial registration number]\n\nFunding: [Source of funding]",
