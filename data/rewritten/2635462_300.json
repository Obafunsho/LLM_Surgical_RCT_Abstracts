A 300-word version\n\nTitle: A Randomised Controlled Trial of an Aspirator Retractor for Enhancing Cement Fixation in Hip Arthroplasty\n\nBackground: Ensuring durable implant fixation during socket cementation is critical for long-term success in hip arthroplasty. This study investigates whether an aspirator retractor improves cement fixation.\n\nMethods: In this randomised controlled trial, 38 patients undergoing hip arthroplasty at a single orthopedic center were included. Eligibility criteria included patients scheduled for primary hip arthroplasty. Participants were randomly assigned to either the intervention group using an aspirator retractor or a control group with standard technique. Randomisation was computer-generated, and allocation was concealed using sealed envelopes. The primary outcome was cement fixation, assessed by radiostereometry and radiographic examination over a minimum of 2 years. Outcome assessors were blinded to group allocation.\n\nResults: 19 patients were randomised to each group, with all participants included in the intention-to-treat analysis. No significant difference was observed in proximal migration between the groups. The intervention group did not show improved fixation, as measured by translations and rotations of the socket. The number and extent of radiolucent lines and the depth of cement penetration were similar between groups. No adverse events were reported in either group.\n\nInterpretation: The aspirator retractor did not enhance cement fixation in the short term. Although the device did not show immediate benefits, it may offer technical advantages during pressurization, especially in challenging cases. Continued follow-up is necessary to determine potential long-term benefits.\n\nTrial registration: [Trial registration number]\n\nFunding: [Source of funding]",
