A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Doppler Microvascular Ultrasound in Skull Base Surgery\n\nBackground: This study investigates the role of Doppler microvascular ultrasound (MVD) in skull base surgery for intraoperative assessment and protection of arterial blood flow.\n\nMethods: In a retrospective analysis, 56 patients underwent skull base tumor resection with MVD assistance at the Department of Neurosurgery, First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University from September 2017 to June 2024. The study included complex skull base tumors, such as those in the sellar region, sphenoid ridge, and cavernous sinus. MVD was used to monitor blood flow in vessels adjacent to the tumors. The spatial relationship and patency of vessels and tumors were evaluated with preoperative multimodal imaging.\n\nResults: No intraoperative vascular injuries were observed, confirmed by intraoperative Doppler monitoring and postoperative imaging. All patients had favorable postoperative outcomes, including no new neurological deficits. MVD facilitated precise intraoperative localization and evaluation of blood vessels, supported by significant increases in contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) after Doppler application. In two cases, the addition of FLOW800 fluorescence imaging provided further CNR improvement, suggesting enhanced visualization and vascular protection.\n\nInterpretation: MVD provides real-time intraoperative information on arterial blood flow during skull base surgeries, enabling surgeons to identify and preserve critical vessels, thereby improving surgical safety, resection accuracy, and patient outcomes. The integration of MVD and fluorescence imaging is expected to play an increasingly vital role in complex skull base procedures.\n\nTrial registration: Not applicable.\n\nFunding: Not specified.",
