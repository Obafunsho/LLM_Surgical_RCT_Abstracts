Patients were randomized to receive SRT (5 × 5 Gy) with surgery within 1 week, SRT with surgery after 4–8 weeks, or LRT (25 × 2 Gy) with surgery after 4–8 weeks. The primary outcome was time to local recurrence (LR) over a minimum follow-up of 5 years. Randomization was stratified by center, and analysis was conducted on an intention-to-treat basis. Blinding was not applicable.\n\nResults: A total of 357, 355, and 128 patients were randomized to SRT, SRT-delay, and LRT-delay, respectively. The incidence of LR was 3/129, 4/128, and 7/128, and distant metastases (DM) were 31/129, 38/128, and 38/128 in the SRT, SRT-delay, and LRT-delay groups, respectively. No significant differences were observed in overall survival (OS) or HRQoL among the groups. Median OS was 8.1, 10.3, and 10.5 years for SRT, SRT-delay, and LRT-delay, respectively. Adverse events were not significantly different among groups.\n\nInterpretation: Delaying surgery for 4–8 weeks after SRT is oncologically safe and results in similar long-term HRQoL outcomes compared to immediate surgery. The trial was registered under NTC00904813 and funded by the Swedish Research Council, Swedish Cancer Society, Stockholm Cancer Society, and other Swedish institutions.",
