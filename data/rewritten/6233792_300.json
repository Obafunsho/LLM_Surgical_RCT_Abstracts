Mindfulness training has been effective in other high-stress populations but remains untested in surgical settings.\n\nMethods: A pilot randomised controlled trial was conducted at a tertiary academic medical center from April 30, 2016, to December 2017. Twenty-one surgical interns were randomised to an 8-week modified Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) program or an active control. The primary outcome was feasibility, assessed across six domains: demand, implementation, practicality, acceptability, adaptation, and integration. Data were collected through focus groups, interviews, surveys, attendance records, daily practice time, and self-reported experience. Randomisation was at the individual level, with allocation concealment. Blinding was not applicable.\n\nResults: Of the 21 participants, 13 were men (62%), with a mean age of 29.0 years in the intervention group and 27.4 years in the control group. The intervention demonstrated feasibility and acceptability, evidenced by no attrition and high attendance rates. There were no significant differences in weekly practice days between groups, although significant differences in daily practice time were noted in weeks 1, 2, and 4. Course satisfaction and perceived credibility were higher in the intervention group (P = .03). Mindfulness skills were successfully integrated into personal and professional settings, with continued practice over 12 months. No adverse events were reported.\n\nInterpretation: Modified MBSR is feasible and acceptable for surgical interns, with beneficial integration into their training and no adverse effects on surgical performance or patient care. Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT03141190. Funding: Not specified.",
