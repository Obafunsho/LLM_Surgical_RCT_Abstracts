A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Arthroscopic Partial Meniscectomy and Physical Therapy in Degenerative Meniscal Tear: A Randomised Controlled Trial\n\nBackground: Arthroscopic partial meniscectomy (APM) combined with physical therapy (PT) has shown similar pain relief to PT alone in degenerative meniscal tear cases. This study aims to identify factors associated with crossover to APM and compare pain relief between crossover patients and those initially randomized to APM.\n\nMethods: The MeTeOR Trial, a randomised controlled trial, included subjects aged ≥45 years with mild-to-moderate osteoarthritis and degenerative meniscal tear. Participants were randomised to APM with PT or PT alone. The primary outcome was pain relief at 6 months, measured by the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) Pain Score. Randomisation was conducted using a computer-generated sequence with allocation concealment. Blinding was not specified.\n\nResults: A total of 341 subjects were randomised: 164 to APM and 177 to PT. Of those in the PT group, 48 (27%) crossed over to APM within 140 days. Multivariate analysis showed a baseline WOMAC Pain Score of ≥40 (RR = 1.99; 95% CI = 1.00, 3.93) and symptom duration <1 year (RR = 1.74; 95% CI = 0.98, 3.08) were predictors of crossover. At 6 months, 81% of crossover patients and 82% of APM patients had ≥10-point pain improvement, compared to 73% in the PT group.\n\nInterpretation: Crossover patients had shorter symptom duration and higher baseline pain. Surgical success rates were similar between crossover and APM groups. Initial PT does not compromise surgical outcomes.",
