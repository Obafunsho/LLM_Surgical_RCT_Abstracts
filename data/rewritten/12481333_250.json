A 250-word version\n\nTitle: A Randomised Controlled Trial Comparing RIMA-SVG and Ao-SVG Techniques in Multivessel CABG\n\nBackground: Coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) is a standard treatment for coronary artery disease. This study evaluates whether the right internal mammary artery-saphenous vein graft (RIMA-SVG) technique is non-inferior to the conventional aorta-saphenous vein graft (Ao-SVG) approach in terms of 1-year graft patency.\n\nMethods: This single-centre, prospective, double-blind, randomised clinical trial will enrol 300 patients undergoing CABG at the Second Hospital of Jilin University. Participants will be randomised into two groups (RIMA-SVG vs Ao-SVG) using computer-generated randomisation with allocation concealment. The primary outcome is the 1-year SVG patency rate, assessed using coronary CT angiography. Secondary outcomes include perioperative complications, all-cause mortality, major adverse cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events (MACCE), and surgical site infections. Blinding will be maintained for patients and data analysts.\n\nResults: The trial will randomise 150 participants to each group, with recruitment from February 2025 to July 2026. Non-inferiority will be established if the upper bound of the one-sided 97.5% CI for the difference in graft occlusion rates is less than the prespecified non-inferiority margin of 10%.\n\nInterpretation: This trial aims to determine if the RIMA-SVG technique offers a technically safer alternative to Ao-SVG without compromising graft patency. The findings will be disseminated through academic journals and conferences.\n\nTrial registration: NCT06787651.\n\nFunding: The study is funded by the Second Hospital of Jilin University.",
