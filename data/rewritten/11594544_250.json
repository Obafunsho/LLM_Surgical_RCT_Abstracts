The primary outcome was the upper esophageal sphincter (UES) relaxation pressure, measured preoperatively and at 1 month postoperatively using high-resolution impedance manometry (HRIM). The trial was conducted at a single tertiary medical center, with randomisation performed using a computer spreadsheet and allocation concealed from patients and analysts. The treating physician was blinded during swallowing assessments.\n\nResults: Thirty patients completed the study, with 15 in each group. The median postoperative UES relaxation pressure was significantly lower in the corticosteroid group (24.5 mm Hg) compared to the saline group (33.6 mm Hg; mean difference = -9.1 mm Hg, 95% CI -15.8 to -2.4; p = 0.01). No significant differences were observed in other HRIM parameters or EAT-10 scores. No adverse events were reported.\n\nInterpretation: Local corticosteroids significantly reduced UES relaxation pressure at 1 month post-ACDF, suggesting potential benefits in enhancing UES opening. Further research is needed to confirm these findings.\n\nTrial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT04717713.\n\nFunding: Not specified.",
