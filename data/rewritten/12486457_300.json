A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Comparative Effectiveness of Coronary Revascularization Techniques: A Network Meta-Analysis\n\nBackground: Multivessel coronary artery disease (MVD) often necessitates revascularization. This study aimed to compare the effectiveness of five revascularization techniques in reducing early mortality, stroke, complete revascularization, postoperative atrial fibrillation (POAF), and renal failure.\n\nMethods: This systematic review and network meta-analysis included 32 studies with 65,861 patients. The interventions compared were on-pump coronary artery bypass (ONCAB), off-pump coronary artery bypass (OPCAB), OPCAB with proximal anastomotic device (OPCAB-PAD), anaortic OPCAB (anOPCAB), and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using a random effects model. Risk of bias was assessed using the RoB2 and ROBINS-I tools.\n\nResults: Compared to ONCAB, early mortality was significantly lower with anOPCAB (OR: 0.57, 95% CI: 0.44–0.73), OPCAB-PAD (OR: 0.61, 95% CI: 0.40–0.92), and OPCAB (OR: 0.64, 95% CI: 0.47–0.87). Stroke risk was lowest with anOPCAB (OR: 0.29, 95% CI: 0.21–0.40) and OPCAB-PAD (OR: 0.32, 95% CI: 0.21–0.49). All surgical techniques achieved significantly more complete revascularization than PCI. POAF and renal failure were significantly lower with anOPCAB compared to ONCAB (POAF: OR: 0.72, 95% CI: 0.59–0.89; renal failure: OR: 0.63, 95% CI: 0.46–0.86). No significant publication bias was detected for mortality and stroke, though funnel plot asymmetry was noted for revascularization.\n\nInterpretation: Off-pump techniques, particularly anOPCAB, significantly reduce stroke risk while achieving comparable revascularization success to ONCAB. PCI remains limited by incomplete revascularization, supporting its use primarily in patients at high surgical risk. Trial registration: PROSPERO CRD42024586444. Funding: Not specified.",
