The primary outcome was the incidence of CRBSIs, measured over the study duration. Randomisation methods varied, with some studies using appropriate randomisation and allocation concealment. Blinding was not feasible due to the nature of the intervention.\n\nResults: Five RCTs were included, with a total of 962 participants. Paired meta-analyses showed a lower incidence of CRBSIs in the peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) group compared to the central venous catheter (CVC) group (RR = 0.23, 95% CI 0.13–0.43, p < 0.00001) and the totally implantable venous access port (TIVAP) group (RR = 0.45, 95% CI 0.23–0.87, p = 0.02). The network meta-analysis confirmed a significantly lower incidence of CRBSIs in the PICC group compared to the CVC group. No significant differences were observed in other comparisons.\n\nInterpretation: PICCs exhibit the lowest incidence of CRBSIs among CVADs, followed by TIVAPs. PICCs should be prioritized when selecting CVADs. No adverse events were reported. Trial registration and funding details were not provided.",
