Participants received a 4 mL/kg crystalloid load in both supine and modified prone positions. Fluid responsiveness was defined as a ≥15% increase in stroke volume (SV) measured by FloTrac/Vigileo™. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to evaluate dynamic variables. The study was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04002193).\n\nResults: Of 50 patients, 43 were analyzed after excluding those with surgery cancellation or vasoactive drug use. In the supine position, 21 were responders. In the modified prone position, SV decreased significantly, while PVI, SVV, and PPV increased (p < 0.001). Thirteen were responders in the modified prone position. The ROC AUCs for ΔPVI, ΔSVV, and ΔPPV were 0.524 (95% CI 0.329–0.730, p = 0.476), 0.749 (95% CI 0.566–0.931, p = 0.004), and 0.790 (95% CI 0.641–0.938, p < 0.001), respectively.\n\nInterpretation: Crystalloid pre-loading did not prevent SV reduction in the modified prone position. PVI changes were less reliable for predicting fluid responsiveness compared to SVV and PPV. No adverse events were reported. The study was funded by institutional resources. The findings suggest that PVI may not be suitable for predicting fluid responsiveness in the modified prone position, highlighting the need for further research in different surgical positions.",
