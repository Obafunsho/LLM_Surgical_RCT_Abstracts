A 300-word version\n\nTitle: The effect of sildenafil on post-cardiac surgery acute kidney injury: a randomised controlled trial.\n\nBackground: This study assessed the efficacy of intravenous sildenafil citrate in preventing acute kidney injury (AKI) in patients undergoing cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass.\n\nMethods: In a double-blind, parallel-group randomised controlled trial, 129 adults at increased risk of AKI undergoing cardiac surgery at a single UK tertiary centre were randomised to receive either sildenafil citrate 12.5 mg intravenously over 150 minutes or a dextrose 5% placebo at the start of surgery. The primary outcome was serum creatinine concentration measured at six time points up to 96 hours post-surgery. Randomisation was stratified by procedure type and baseline estimated glomerular filtration rate, with allocation concealed. Patients, clinicians, and outcome assessors were blinded. The primary analysis used a linear mixed-effects model adjusted for stratification variables.\n\nResults: Between September 2015 and September 2018, 60 participants were randomised to sildenafil and 69 to placebo. The intention-to-treat analysis showed no significant difference in serum creatinine between groups (mean difference: 0.88 μmol/L, 95% CI: -5.82 to 7.59, p = 0.797). Multiple organ dysfunction scores were significantly higher in the sildenafil group (mean difference: 0.54, 95% CI: 0.02 to 1.07, p = 0.044). Secondary outcomes and biomarkers of kidney injury, endothelial function, and inflammatory cell activation showed no significant differences between groups. Adverse events were similar, with no anaphylactic reactions reported. Two patients in the placebo group experienced hypotension requiring treatment.\n\nInterpretation: Intravenous sildenafil citrate does not reduce the severity of AKI in adult cardiac surgery patients and may increase multiple organ dysfunction scores. Further research is needed to explore the safety profile of sildenafil in this context.\n\nTrial registration: ISRCTN18386427.\n\nFunding: British Heart Foundation and Leicester and Bristol National Institute for Health Research Cardiovascular Biomedical Research Units.",
