A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Tobramycin-Impregnated Bone Cement in Total Knee Arthroplasty\n\nBackground: This randomised controlled trial aimed to evaluate the efficacy of tobramycin-impregnated bone cement in achieving therapeutic antibiotic levels in total knee arthroplasty (TKA) patients.\n\nMethods: Conducted at a single center, 15 patients undergoing primary TKA were randomly assigned to either the intervention group (n=10) receiving tobramycin-impregnated bone cement or the control group (n=5) receiving standard intravenous tobramycin. Randomisation was performed using a blinded envelope method. Serum and intraarticular tobramycin levels were measured at 6, 24, and 48 hours postoperatively using an immunoassay technique. The primary outcome was intraarticular tobramycin concentration.\n\nResults: The intervention group showed significantly higher intraarticular tobramycin levels at 6 hours (median=31.8 μg/mL, p=0.002), 24 hours (median=17.1 μg/mL, p=0.002), and 48 hours (median=6.8 μg/mL, p=0.02) compared to the control group. Serum tobramycin levels in the intervention group were ≤0.3 μg/mL, significantly lower than the control group at all time points (p<0.001). No adverse events were reported in either group.\n\nInterpretation: Tobramycin-impregnated bone cement achieves supratherapeutic local antibiotic concentrations with minimal systemic absorption, offering a potential advantage over intravenous administration alone. The study supports its use in TKA to reduce infection risk.\n\nTrial registration: Not provided.\n\nFunding: Not disclosed.",
