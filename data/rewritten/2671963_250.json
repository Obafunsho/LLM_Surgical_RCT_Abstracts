A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of ET-AR Antagonist in Post-Cardiac Surgery Inflammation\n\nBackground: This randomised controlled trial investigated the effect of an endothelin-A receptor (ET-AR) antagonist on tumor necrosis factor (TNF) activation post-cardiac surgery. Basic studies suggest cross-talk between ET-AR and TNF signaling pathways.\n\nMethods: Forty-four patients undergoing cardiac surgery were randomised to receive a bolus infusion of vehicle or ET-AR antagonist (sitaxsentan) at doses of 0.1, 0.5, 1, or 2 mg/kg at separation from cardiopulmonary bypass. Plasma levels of TNF-α and soluble TNF receptors 1 and 2 were measured at baseline and 24 hours post-infusion. Randomisation was computer-generated, and allocation was concealed. Blinding was maintained for outcome assessors, patients, and clinicians.\n\nResults: At 24 hours, the 1 mg/kg ET-AR antagonist group showed reduced plasma levels of TNF-α and TNF receptor 2 compared to the vehicle group (mean difference ~13 pg/mL and ~0.5 ng/mL, respectively; p<0.05). TNF receptor 1 levels decreased by ~1 ng/mL with higher doses and remained lower by ~3 ng/mL at 24 hours (p<0.05). A dose-response effect was observed (p<0.01). No adverse events were reported.\n\nInterpretation: The ET-AR antagonist modulates TNF receptor activation post-cardiac surgery, suggesting potential therapeutic benefits beyond cardiovascular effects.
