A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of LFCN Block Addition to PENG Block in Hip Fracture Surgery\n\nBackground: This randomised controlled trial evaluated the effect of adding a lateral femoral cutaneous nerve (LFCN) block to a pericapsular nerve group (PENG) block on postoperative opioid consumption and pain scores in hip fracture surgery under spinal anesthesia.\n\nMethods: Conducted at Zonguldak Bülent Ecevit University Hospital, Türkiye, 60 patients aged 18-75 undergoing hip fracture surgery were randomised into three groups: PENG, PENG + LFCN, and CONTROL. The PENG group received 20 mL of 0.25% bupivacaine, while the PENG + LFCN group received an additional 5 mL LFCN block. The primary outcome was postoperative opioid consumption within 24 hours. Randomisation was computer-assisted with allocation concealment via sealed envelopes. Outcome assessors were blinded.\n\nResults: 60 patients were analysed (20 per group) using a per-protocol approach. Postoperative opioid consumption was significantly lower in the PENG (8.10 ± 6.72 mg) and PENG + LFCN (8.40 ± 4.38 mg) groups compared to CONTROL (15.30 ± 5.59 mg, P < 0.001). No significant difference was found between PENG and PENG + LFCN groups. No adverse events were reported.\n\nInterpretation: Adding an LFCN block to the PENG block did not significantly affect opioid consumption or pain scores compared to PENG alone. Preoperative PENG block is effective for analgesia management. Trial registration: NCT06226675. Funding: Not specified.",
