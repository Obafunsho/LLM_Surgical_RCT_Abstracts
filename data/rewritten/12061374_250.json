Eligibility criteria included age ≥18 years, knee pain for >6 months, and radiographic evidence of osteoarthritis. The primary outcome was the difference in average pain at 14 days post-intervention, measured using a numeric rating scale. Randomisation was computer-generated with allocation concealment, and blinding included patients and outcome assessors.\n\nResults: In the intention-to-treat analysis, no significant difference was observed for the primary outcome (mean difference = 0.49; 95% CI, –0.3 to 1.2; P = 0.198). Both groups showed significant pain reduction at 14 days (cryoneurolysis: –1.9; 95% CI, –2.4 to –1.3; sham: –1.4; 95% CI, –1.9 to –0.8). At 6 months, cryoneurolysis showed a significant reduction compared to sham (mean difference = 1.1; 95% CI, 0.3 to 1.9; P = 0.009). Minor, transient adverse effects were reported.\n\nInterpretation: Cryoneurolysis did not demonstrate a clinically relevant reduction in pain compared to sham at 14 days. Further research is needed to explore alternative protocols.\n\nTrial registration: NCT03774121.\n\nFunding: Supported by the Danish Rheumatism Association and the Danish Health Authority.",
