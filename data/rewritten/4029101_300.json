A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Sequential Interventions for Posttransplant Lymphoproliferative Disease in Adult Solid Organ Transplant Recipients\n\nBackground: This randomised controlled trial assessed a sequential treatment algorithm for posttransplant lymphoproliferative disease (PTLD) in adult solid organ transplant recipients, starting with reduction in immunosuppressives (RI), followed by interferon (IFN) alpha2b, and chemotherapy.\n\nMethods: Conducted across multiple centers, the trial included adult solid organ transplant recipients with biopsy-proven PTLD. RI involved a 50% reduction in cyclosporine or tacrolimus for 2 weeks, with a further 50% reduction for 1 week if complete remission (CR) was not achieved. Intravenous acyclovir was administered during RI. Patients not achieving CR or experiencing rejection proceeded to IFN 3 MIU/m²/day for up to 3 months, followed by ProMACE-CytaBOM chemotherapy if necessary. Randomisation and allocation concealment methods were not specified. Blinding was not implemented. The primary outcome was CR, measured over the treatment course.\n\nResults: Sixteen eligible patients were analysed. RI resulted in 1 partial response (12.5%) and no CR. Progressive disease occurred in 50% and rejection in 38%. Only 1 patient achieved durable CR with IFN. Seven patients received chemotherapy, with 5 achieving CR, 4 of which were durable beyond 2 years. Adverse events were not detailed.\n\nInterpretation: RI was ineffective in achieving CR, with frequent progressive disease and rejection. IFN response was rare. Chemotherapy showed a 57% durable CR rate. The study suggests adding rituximab to RI as initial therapy. Trial registration and funding details were not provided. The findings are relevant for PTLD patients refractory to rituximab, highlighting the potential of chemotherapy in achieving durable CR. Further research is needed to optimize initial treatment strategies.",
