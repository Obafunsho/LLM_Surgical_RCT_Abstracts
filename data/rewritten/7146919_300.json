This study assesses FPE rates and outcomes in the ASTER trial comparing stent retriever (SR) and contact aspiration (CA) techniques.\n\nMethods: The ASTER trial was a multicenter, randomized, open-label, blinded endpoint trial conducted from October 2015 to October 2016. Adults with anterior circulation ischemic stroke within 6 hours of onset were randomized to SR (n=189) or CA (n=192). The primary outcome was favorable clinical outcome (mRS 0-2) at 90 days. Randomization was stratified by intravenous thrombolysis use, and angiographic outcomes were assessed by a blinded core laboratory. The analysis included 336 patients using an intention-to-treat approach.\n\nResults: FPE was achieved in 97 of 336 patients (28.9%), with no significant difference between SR (31.3%) and CA (26.3%) (adjusted RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.54 to 1.31; p=0.44). FPE was associated with improved clinical outcomes (adjusted RR 1.38, 95% CI 1.22 to 1.56) and lower mortality (adjusted RR 0.56, 95% CI 0.35 to 0.88). FPE also resulted in fewer hemorrhagic transformations (adjusted RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.00) and procedural complications (adjusted RR 0.51, 95% CI 0.26 to 0.99).\n\nInterpretation: Both SR and CA achieved similar FPE rates, with FPE linked to better outcomes and reduced complications. Further research is needed to enhance FPE rates and identify predictors.\n\nTrial registration: NCT02523261\n\nFunding: Not specified.",
