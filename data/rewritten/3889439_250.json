A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Robotic-Assisted vs. Conventional THA\n\nBackground: Improper acetabular component orientation in total hip arthroplasty (THA) is linked to increased dislocation rates and component wear. This study compares robotic-assisted THA with conventional techniques to assess cup positioning within safe zones.\n\nMethods: This matched-pair controlled study included 100 patients undergoing THA between September 2008 and September 2012. Participants were matched by gender, age ±5 years, and BMI ±7 units. The intervention group (n=50) received robotic-assisted THA, while the control group (n=50) underwent conventional THA. The primary outcome was the proportion of cups positioned within the safe zones of Lewinnek et al. and Callanan et al., assessed radiographically. Randomisation and allocation concealment methods were not specified. Blinding details were not provided.\n\nResults: All robotic-assisted THAs (100%) were within Lewinnek's safe zone compared to 80% of conventional THAs (p=0.001). For Callanan's modified safe zone, 92% of robotic-assisted THAs were within range versus 62% of conventional THAs (p=0.001). Odds ratios for cups outside the safe zones were zero and 0.142, respectively (95% CI, 0.044, 0.457). No adverse events were reported.\n\nInterpretation: Robotic assistance improved acetabular cup placement within safe zones, potentially enhancing THA outcomes. However, clinical benefits remain unproven. Trial registration and funding details were not provided.",
