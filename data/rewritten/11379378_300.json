Participants were evaluated over 90 days using the Objective Structured Assessment of Technical Skills (OSATS) Modified. The primary outcome was the acquisition of operative skills and reduction in anastomosis time for side-to-side (S-T-S), end-to-side (E-T-S), and end-to-end (E-T-E) coronary anastomoses. All sessions were recorded and evaluated by a single senior cardiothoracic surgeon. Randomisation and blinding were not applicable.\n\nResults: A total of 140 residents were assessed in 270 sessions. Junior residents showed significant improvement in S-T-S anastomosis skills, including the use of the Castroviejo needle holder, needle angles, and needle transfer (p < 0.05). Senior residents demonstrated significant improvement in S-T-S anastomosis skills, including graft orientation, appropriate spacing, use of forceps, angles, and needle transfer (p < 0.05). Senior residents also showed a significant reduction in anastomosis time compared to juniors in S-T-S (8.11 vs. 11.22 minutes), E-T-S (7.93 vs. 10.10 minutes), and E-T-E (6.56 vs. 9.68 minutes) (p = 0.039).\n\nInterpretation: The simulator effectively improved operative skills and reduced anastomosis time, indicating a positive impact on surgical training. No adverse events were reported. The study was not registered, and funding details were not provided. The findings support the integration of simulator training into cardiovascular surgery curricula to enhance skill development and patient safety.",
