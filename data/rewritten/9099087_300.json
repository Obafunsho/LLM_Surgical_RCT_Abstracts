A 300-word version\n\nTitle: A Randomised Controlled Trial Comparing Modified Ligation Procedure and Stapled Haemorrhoidectomy for Symptomatic Haemorrhoids\n\nBackground: This study aimed to evaluate the safety, efficacy, and cost-effectiveness of a modified ligation procedure for prolapsed haemorrhoids (MLPPH) compared to stapled haemorrhoidectomy (SH) in patients with symptomatic haemorrhoids.\n\nMethods: Conducted at Putuo Hospital, Shanghai, this single-centre, randomised, single-blind trial enrolled patients aged 18–80 years with symptomatic second- to fourth-degree haemorrhoids from May 2018 to September 2021. Participants were randomised 1:1 to MLPPH or SH. The primary outcome was the 6-month cure rate. Randomisation was stratified by haemorrhoid grade using a computer-generated sequence, with allocation concealment via opaque envelopes. Blinding was not applied to participants or clinicians.\n\nResults: Of 187 patients screened, 133 were randomised (67 to MLPPH, 66 to SH). One patient in the MLPPH group was excluded, and two were lost to follow-up. The 6-month cure rate was significantly higher in the MLPPH group (90.6%) compared to the SH group (69.7%) (P = 0.003). The mean operating time was longer for MLPPH (57.42 min) than SH (30.68 min) (P < 0.001). MLPPH resulted in lower pain scores at postoperative days 3, 7, and 14, and lower Wexner incontinence scores at months 1 and 3. Cost-effectiveness analysis showed lower mean costs for MLPPH (EUR 1080.24) compared to SH (EUR 1657.97) (P < 0.001), with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of −120 656.19 EUR/QALYs.\n\nInterpretation: MLPPH is a longer but more cost-effective procedure than SH, offering superior short-term outcomes in terms of pain and incontinence scores. The findings support MLPPH as a viable alternative to SH for treating symptomatic haemorrhoids. Trial registration: ChiCTR1800015928. Funding: Not specified.",
