Participants were divided into two cohorts based on the presence or absence of postoperative AKI within 30 days. The primary outcome was the 36-month cumulative incidence of CKD. We used univariate and multivariate analyses to assess the time to CKD development.\n\nResults: Among 378 patients, 51 (13.5%) developed postoperative AKI. Over a median follow-up of 19.4 months, patients with AKI were twice as likely to develop CKD (p<0.001). The cumulative incidence of CKD at 36 months was 23.4%. On univariate analysis, AKI was associated with CKD (HR=2.17, 95% CI 1.22–3.84), but this association was not significant in multivariate analysis. Older age, body mass index ≥30 kg/m², hypertension, higher preoperative creatinine, and neoadjuvant chemotherapy were significantly associated with CKD.\n\nInterpretation: Postoperative AKI was not significantly associated with long-term CKD or cardiac conditions after open ERAS surgery for gynecologic malignancies. Other factors, such as age and preoperative health status, appear more critical in CKD development. Trial registration and funding details were not provided.",
