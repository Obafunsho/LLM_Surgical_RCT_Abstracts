The primary outcome was myocardial damage, measured by troponin I levels, assessed preoperatively and at multiple time points postoperatively. Secondary outcomes included oxidative stress markers and organ function indicators. Randomisation was computer-generated, and allocation was concealed. Blinding was applied to outcome assessors.\n\nResults: Troponin I levels were significantly lower in the normoxic group (−29%, 95% CI −48% to −3%, P = .03). Protein S100 release was reduced in the normoxic group 10 minutes after starting bypass (−26%, 95% CI −40% to −9%, P = .005) and 10 minutes after aortic crossclamp removal (−23%, 95% CI −38% to −3%, P = .02). Alpha-glutamate transferase release was also lower in the normoxic group 10 minutes after aortic crossclamp removal (−28%, 95% CI −44% to −9%, P = .006). No significant differences were observed in the release of C3a, interleukins 6, 8, and 10, and cortisol between groups. No adverse events were reported.\n\nInterpretation: Controlled reoxygenation during cardiopulmonary bypass reduces myocardial damage, oxidative stress, and cerebral and hepatic injury compared to hyperoxic bypass, with a similar inflammatory and stress response.
