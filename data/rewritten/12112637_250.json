A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Endovascular Versus Open Surgical Treatment for Isolated Popliteal Artery Lesions\n\nBackground: Isolated popliteal artery (PA) lesions represent a small fraction of lower limb revascularisations, posing unique challenges due to anatomical and biomechanical factors. This study aims to compare the efficacy and safety of endovascular treatment (EVT) versus open surgical interventions for isolated PA lesions.\n\nMethods: This randomised controlled trial was conducted at a tertiary vascular surgery center. Eligible participants included patients with isolated PA lesions, excluding those with aneurysms or traumatic injuries. Participants were randomly assigned to receive either EVT or open surgery. The primary outcome was primary patency at 12 months. Randomisation was computer-generated, and allocation was concealed using sealed envelopes. Blinding was not feasible due to the nature of the interventions.\n\nResults: A total of 200 participants were randomised: 100 to the EVT group and 100 to the open surgery group. Analysis was conducted on an intention-to-treat basis. The primary patency rate at 12 months was 71.7% in the EVT group and 75.6% in the open surgery group (p = 0.510). Adverse events were reported in 3% of the EVT group and 1% of the open surgery group.\n\nInterpretation: Both EVT and open surgery demonstrated comparable primary patency rates at 12 months, with a slightly higher incidence of adverse events in the EVT group. Further large-scale studies are needed to confirm these findings and guide treatment decisions.\n\nTrial registration: N/A\n\nFunding: This study was supported by institutional research grants.",
