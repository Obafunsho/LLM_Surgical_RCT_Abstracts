Conventional treatments have limitations, prompting exploration of regenerative techniques.\n\nMethods: This randomised controlled trial was conducted to evaluate the efficacy of cardiovascular regenerative medicine (CaVaReM) in repairing damaged heart tissue. Participants were recruited based on eligibility criteria, including diagnosis of heart failure. The study was conducted in a clinical setting. Participants were randomly assigned to receive either CaVaReM interventions, including stem cells and tissue engineering, or standard care as a control. Randomisation was performed using a computer-generated sequence, with allocation concealment ensured by sealed envelopes. Blinding was applied to outcome assessors.\n\nResults: A total of 200 participants were randomised, with 100 in the intervention group and 100 in the control group, recruited between January 2020 and June 2021. Analysis was conducted on 98 participants in the intervention group and 97 in the control group using an intention-to-treat approach. The primary outcome was improvement in cardiac function over 12 months, with a mean difference of 5.2% (95% CI 3.1 to 7.3; p = 0.01). Adverse events were reported in 3% of the intervention group and 1% of the control group, with mild gastrointestinal side-effects.\n\nInterpretation: CaVaReM showed potential in improving cardiac function, though further research is needed.
