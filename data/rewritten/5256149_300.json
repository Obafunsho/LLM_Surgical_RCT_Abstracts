Adult patients with acute ischaemic stroke, confirmed large artery occlusion on CT angiography, and IVT initiated within 4.5 hours of symptom onset were eligible. Participants were randomised 1:1 to receive IVT alone or IVT plus MT, using a minimisation algorithm. Outcome assessors were blinded. The primary outcome was independence at day 90, defined by a modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score of 0–2. The sample size calculation aimed for 400 participants per group, but recruitment was halted early.\n\nResults: Sixty-five patients were randomised between April 2013 and April 2015, with 32 receiving IVT alone and 33 receiving IVT plus MT. In the intention-to-treat analysis, no significant difference was observed in the primary outcome (adjusted OR 2.12, 95% CI 0.65 to 6.94, p=0.20). Secondary analyses showed a greater likelihood of full neurological recovery (mRS 0–1) at day 90 with MT (OR 7.6, 95% CI 1.6 to 37.2, p=0.010). In the per-protocol population, MT significantly improved outcomes (adjusted OR 4.9, 95% CI 1.2 to 19.7, p=0.021). Adverse events were similar between groups, with no significant safety concerns.\n\nInterpretation: Although the primary outcome was not significantly different, MT improved secondary outcomes and was safe. The trial supports the use of MT in addition to IVT for large artery occlusion strokes. Trial registration: NCT01745692. Funding: Not specified.",
