A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Plasma-Platelet-RBC Ratios in Emergency Laparotomy\n\nBackground: The Pragmatic Randomized Optimal Platelet and Plasma Ratios (PROPPR) trial indicated that a 1:1:1 plasma-platelet-RBC ratio improves survival in massive transfusion. This study evaluates its effect on survival after emergency laparotomy.\n\nMethods: In this randomised controlled trial, severely injured patients predicted to need massive transfusion were enrolled at 12 level I North American trauma centers. Participants were randomised to receive a 1:1:1 or 1:1:2 ratio. The primary outcome was survival at 24 hours and 30 days post-emergency laparotomy, defined as laparotomy within 90 minutes of arrival. Randomisation was computer-generated, with allocation concealment ensured. Blinding was not applicable due to the nature of the intervention.\n\nResults: A total of 680 patients were randomised, with 338 assigned to the 1:1:1 group and 342 to the 1:1:2 group. Of these, 346 underwent emergency laparotomy. The 24-hour survival rate was 86.8% for the 1:1:1 group and 83.1% for the 1:1:2 group (p=0.29), while the 30-day survival rate was 79.3% for the 1:1:1 group and 75.0% for the 1:1:2 group (p=0.30). No significant differences in adverse events were observed between the groups.\n\nInterpretation: The resuscitation strategy did not significantly impact the requirement for emergency laparotomy, time to laparotomy, or survival outcomes. These findings suggest that the 1:1:1 ratio does not confer additional survival benefits in the context of emergency laparotomy. Trial registration: [Trial registration number].
