  "abstract": "2. 300-word version\n\nBackground: A ruptured internal iliac artery aneurysm (IIAA) that perforates the common iliac vein is a rare but potentially fatal condition. This study aimed to assess the effectiveness of temporary balloon occlusion of an arteriovenous fistula (AVF) via the femoral vein in achieving hemodynamic stability before endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR).\n\nMethods: Conducted as a single-case study at a tertiary care hospital, this research involved an 80-year-old male patient presenting with a ruptured IIAA and AVF. The intervention consisted of temporary balloon occlusion of the AVF through the femoral vein, followed by EVAR with coil embolization. The primary outcome was hemodynamic stability, evaluated immediately after the intervention.\n\nResults: The patient achieved hemodynamic stability following the temporary balloon occlusion of the AVF. This allowed for successful EVAR without complications. Postoperative computed tomography confirmed the absence of arteriovenous flow and no endoleaks. The patient was discharged 30 days post-surgery with improved renal function and cardiac status. No adverse events were reported during the intervention or follow-up period.\n\nInterpretation: Temporary balloon occlusion of an AVF via the femoral vein can effectively stabilize hemodynamics, facilitating successful emergency EVAR under stable conditions. This approach may offer a viable treatment option for similar cases of ruptured IIAA with AVF, potentially improving patient outcomes.\n\nFunding: The authors reported no funding sources for this study.",
