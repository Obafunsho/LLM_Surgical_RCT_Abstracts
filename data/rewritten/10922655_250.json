A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Long-term Outcomes of Immediate vs. Postponed Drainage in Infected Necrotizing Pancreatitis: A Randomised Controlled Trial\n\nBackground: The POINTER trial evaluated the long-term outcomes of immediate versus postponed drainage in patients with infected necrotizing pancreatitis.\n\nMethods: This multicenter randomised controlled trial was conducted in 22 Dutch hospitals. A total of 104 patients with infected necrotizing pancreatitis were randomised to immediate catheter drainage (55 patients) or postponed catheter drainage (49 patients) between August 2015 and October 2019. The primary outcome was a composite of death and major complications, assessed over a median follow-up of 51 months. Randomisation was computer-generated, and allocation was concealed. Blinding was not applied.\n\nResults: Of the 104 patients, 88 were re-evaluated after the initial 6-month follow-up. The primary outcome occurred in 7 of 47 patients (15%) in the immediate-drainage group and 7 of 41 patients (17%) in the postponed-drainage group (RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.33–2.28; P = 0.78). Additional drainage procedures were required in 7 patients (15%) versus 3 patients (7%) (RR 2.03; 95% CI 0.56–7.37; P = 0.34). No significant differences in adverse events were reported between groups.\n\nInterpretation: Postponed drainage using antibiotics results in fewer interventions compared to immediate drainage, with similar long-term outcomes in pancreatic function and quality of life. This approach should be preferred in managing infected necrotizing pancreatitis.\n\nTrial registration: ISRCTN33682933\n\nFunding: This research did not receive any specific funding.",
