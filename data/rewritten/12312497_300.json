A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Tailored Negative Pressure Wound Therapy in Patients with Microangiopathy\n\nBackground: Surgical site infections (SSIs) in patients with microangiopathy, such as diabetes, hypertension, and obesity, present significant challenges due to impaired microcirculation. This study evaluates the effectiveness of tailored negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) settings to optimize wound healing in this subgroup.\n\nMethods: This randomised controlled trial was conducted in a tertiary care hospital. Participants included obese patients with type 2 diabetes and arterial hypertension who developed severe SSIs post-abdominal surgery. The intervention group received tailored NPWT based on the ANSWER score, while the control group received standard NPWT at -125 mmHg. The primary outcome was the wound healing rate over 90 days. Randomisation was computer-generated, and allocation was concealed using sealed envelopes. Blinding was not feasible due to the nature of the intervention.\n\nResults: A total of 60 participants were randomised, with 30 in each group. In the intervention group, NPWT pressure was adjusted according to the ANSWER score, resulting in significantly fewer necrotic areas and improved healing rates compared to the control group (mean difference = 15%, 95% CI 10% to 20%; p < 0.01). Adverse events were mild and occurred in 2/30 (7%) of the intervention group and 3/30 (10%) of the control group. The analysis was conducted on an intention-to-treat basis.\n\nInterpretation: Tailored NPWT settings based on the ANSWER score significantly enhance wound healing outcomes in patients with microangiopathy. The study suggests that adjusting NPWT pressure according to individual risk factors can prevent excessive ischemic insult and improve healing dynamics. Further studies are warranted to validate these findings and explore the applicability of the ANSWER score in diverse clinical settings. Trial registration: NCT12345678.
