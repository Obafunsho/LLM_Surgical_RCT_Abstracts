A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Nicotinamide Riboside in Cardiac Ischemia-Reperfusion Injury\n\nBackground: Nicotinamide riboside (NR) is a promising NAD+ precursor with potential cardioprotective properties. This study evaluates NR's ability to protect isolated mouse hearts from ischemia-reperfusion (IR) injury.\n\nMethods: In this randomised controlled trial, C57BL6/N adult male mice were used. Hearts were isolated and perfused using the Langendorff setup. Mice were randomised to receive either NR (50 mg/L) or vehicle control. The primary outcome was infarct size, assessed by TTC staining after 90 minutes of reperfusion. Randomisation was conducted using a computer-generated sequence, and allocation was concealed. Outcome assessors were blinded to group assignments.\n\nResults: Sixteen mice were randomised, with 8 assigned to each group. NR treatment significantly reduced infarct size compared to control (mean difference = 15%, 95% CI 10% to 20%; p < 0.01). No adverse events were observed in either group. NR's cardioprotective effect was associated with increased glycolysis, as indicated by prolonged time of contracture during ischemia.\n\nInterpretation: NR significantly reduces infarct size in isolated mouse hearts subjected to IR injury, likely through enhanced glycolysis. These findings support NR's potential as a cardioprotective agent, warranting further investigation into its mechanisms and clinical relevance.\n\nTrial registration: Not provided.\n\nFunding: The study was funded by institutional grants.",
