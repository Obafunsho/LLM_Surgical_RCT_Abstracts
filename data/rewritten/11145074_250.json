A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Mini-Access Versus Sternotomy in Total Arch Replacement\n\nBackground: Open arch repair is a high-risk procedure, often avoiding minimally invasive approaches. This study evaluates the efficacy and safety of mini-access total arch replacement (TAR) compared to conventional sternotomy.\n\nMethods: This randomised controlled trial was conducted at Asan Medical Center, Seoul, Korea, enrolling 95 patients undergoing elective TAR between December 2018 and June 2022. Participants were randomised to either mini-access TAR (n=40) or sternotomy TAR (n=55). The primary outcome was a composite of early mortality and disabling stroke within 30 days. Secondary outcomes included major complications and length of hospital stay. Randomisation was computer-generated, with allocation concealment ensured. Blinding was not feasible due to the nature of the interventions.\n\nResults: The mini-access group showed a lower risk of the primary composite outcome (odds ratio, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.78-1.00; P=0.049) and major complications (odds ratio, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.68-0.92; P=0.003) compared to the sternotomy group. No early mortality was observed, and disabling stroke occurred in 5.0% of the mini-access group. The mini-access group also had a shorter hospital stay and lower postoperative pain scores.\n\nHarm: Adverse events were less frequent in the mini-access group.\n\nTrial registration: Not provided.\n\nFunding: Not reported.",
