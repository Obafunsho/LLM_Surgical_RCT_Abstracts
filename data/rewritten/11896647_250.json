A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Liraglutide in Cardiac Surgery\n\nBackground: This study investigates the effect of preoperative liraglutide on insulin secretion and glucose control in patients undergoing cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB).\n\nMethods: In this prospective, single-center substudy of the multicenter GLOBE trial (NTR6323), 37 adult patients scheduled for elective cardiac surgery were randomized to receive either liraglutide or placebo. The liraglutide group received 0.6 mg the evening before surgery and 1.2 mg after anesthesia induction. The primary outcome was the change in insulin secretion, measured by HOMA-B, before and after surgery. Randomization was stratified by center and type 2 diabetes status, with allocation concealed. Patients, clinicians, and outcome assessors were blinded.\n\nResults: Between April and August 2018, 21 patients were randomized to liraglutide and 16 to placebo. Analysis was per-protocol. Liraglutide significantly increased HOMA-B (258 ± 179 vs 116 ± 180, difference: 142, 95% CI: 24–261, P = 0.004) and insulin/glucagon ratios preoperatively (1.09 ± 0.45 vs 0.79 ± 0.35, difference: −0.30, 95% CI: −0.57 to −0.03, P = 0.039). Postoperative insulin levels decreased >60% from preoperative levels (55 ± 31 to 21 ± 9.8, difference: −29, 95% CI: −36 to −22, P < 0.001). No significant adverse events were reported.\n\nInterpretation: Preoperative liraglutide enhances beta-cell function and insulin/glucagon ratios, potentially improving glucose and FFA control during cardiac surgery.
