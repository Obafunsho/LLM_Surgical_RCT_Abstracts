This study evaluates the therapeutic potential of engineered extracellular vesicles (EVs) compared to parental stem cells in OA management.\n\nMethods: This randomised controlled trial was conducted at a tertiary care center. Participants were adults diagnosed with knee OA, meeting specific eligibility criteria. The intervention group received engineered EVs, while the control group received standard care. Randomisation was performed using a computer-generated sequence with allocation concealment via sealed envelopes. Blinding was applied to outcome assessors.\n\nResults: A total of 200 participants were randomised, with 100 in each group, recruited between January 2020 and June 2021. Intention-to-treat analysis included 98 participants in the intervention group and 97 in the control group. The primary outcome was improvement in joint function, measured over 12 months. The intervention group showed a significant improvement (mean difference = 5.2, 95% CI 3.1 to 7.3; p = 0.01). Adverse events were mild, with 3% in the intervention group and 1% in the control group experiencing gastrointestinal side-effects.\n\nInterpretation: Engineered EVs demonstrated superior efficacy in improving joint function in OA patients compared to standard care, with minimal adverse effects. Further research is needed to confirm these findings.\n\nTrial registration: NCT12345678\n\nFunding: Supported by the National Institutes of Health.",
