This study assesses the prognostic utility of the grey-to-white matter ratio (GWR) in predicting neurological outcomes in heat stroke patients.\n\nMethods: Conducted as a multicentre retrospective study, 128 heat stroke patients were enrolled from five hospitals in China between January 2020 and November 2023. Eligibility criteria included patients over 18 years diagnosed with heat stroke who underwent cranial CT. Patients were stratified by Cerebral Performance Category (CPC) scores at discharge into good (CPC 1–2) and poor (CPC 3–5) outcome groups. Seven GWR parameters were calculated. The primary outcome was neurological status at discharge, assessed by CPC scores. Due to the retrospective nature, randomisation and blinding were not applicable.\n\nResults: All GWRs were significantly lower in the poor outcome group compared to the good outcome group. The GWR basal ganglia demonstrated the highest sensitivity (80.95%) and specificity (90.77%) for predicting poor outcomes. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis showed areas under the curve for GWR basal ganglia at 0.855. Combining GWR with qSOFA improved predictive performance, with increased specificity and sensitivity. No adverse events were reported.\n\nInterpretation: A low GWR is a strong predictor of poor neurological outcomes in heat stroke patients. The combination of GWR with qSOFA significantly enhances the early prediction of poor outcomes, providing a valuable tool for clinical decision-making. Trial registration: ChiCTR2400079671.
