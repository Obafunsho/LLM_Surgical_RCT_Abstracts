A 250-word version\n\nBackground: This randomised controlled trial investigates the efficacy of combined cup and stem anteversion in total hip arthroplasty (THA) using computer navigation to compensate for abnormal femoral anteversion. Methods: Conducted at a single orthopedic center, 47 patients undergoing THA were randomised. Eligibility criteria included patients with abnormal femoral anteversion. The intervention group used computer navigation for combined anteversion, while the control group relied on the surgeon's estimation. The primary outcome was the precision and bias of stem anteversion, measured postoperatively via CT scans. Randomisation was computer-generated, and allocation was concealed using sealed envelopes. Blinding was applied to outcome assessors. Results: 47 patients were randomised, with 24 in the intervention group and 23 in the control group. Analysis was per-protocol. The navigation group showed a precision of 4.8° and a bias of 0.2°, while the control group had a precision of 16.8° and a bias of 0.2°. Combined anteversion by CT was 37.6° ± 7°, with 96% within the safe zone. No adverse events were reported. Interpretation: Computer navigation significantly improves the precision of stem anteversion in THA compared to surgeon estimation. Trial registration: [Trial registration number].
