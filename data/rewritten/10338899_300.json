A 300-word version\n\nTitle: A Randomised Controlled Trial of Early Versus Conventional Adjuvant Chemotherapy in Stage III Colon Cancer\n\nBackground: This study aimed to determine the safety and oncological efficacy of early adjuvant chemotherapy (EAC) compared to conventional adjuvant chemotherapy (CAC) in patients with stage III colon cancer.\n\nMethods: A multicentre, randomised (1:1), open-label, phase III trial was conducted at eight tertiary medical centres in South Korea. Eligible participants were adults with histologically confirmed stage III colon cancer who underwent radical surgery. The primary endpoint was 3-year disease-free survival (DFS). EAC was administered between postoperative days 10 and 14, while CAC was administered between days 24 and 28. Randomisation was performed using a web-based platform with allocation concealment. The trial was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT01460589).\n\nResults: Between 9 September 2011 and 6 March 2020, 443 patients were randomised, with 209 in the EAC arm and 214 in the CAC arm. The intention-to-treat analysis included 423 patients. There was no significant difference in overall toxicity (28.1% in EAC vs. 28.2% in CAC, P = 0.244) or quality of life between the groups. Surgical complications were comparable, with no significant differences observed. The primary endpoint of 3-year DFS will be reported in future analyses. Adverse events were similar between groups, with no significant differences in severity.\n\nInterpretation: EAC can be safely initiated 2 weeks post-surgery with similar toxicity and quality of life outcomes as CAC. This trial was funded by the participating institutions. Further follow-up is required to assess the long-term oncological outcomes.",
