A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Preoperative Hepatic and Regional Arterial Chemotherapy in Colorectal Cancer\n\nBackground: This study aimed to assess whether preoperative hepatic and regional arterial chemotherapy (PHRAC) can prevent liver metastasis and enhance survival in patients undergoing curative colorectal cancer resection.\n\nMethods: In this randomised controlled trial, patients with stage II or III colorectal cancer were recruited from [study setting] and randomly assigned to PHRAC (n = 110) or surgery alone (n = 112). The primary endpoint was disease-free survival over a median follow-up of 36 months. Secondary endpoints included liver metastasis-free survival and overall survival. Randomisation was conducted using [randomisation method], with allocation concealment by [method]. Blinding was applied to [outcome assessors/patients/clinicians].\n\nResults: In stage III patients, the PHRAC group demonstrated a significantly longer median liver metastasis time (16 ± 3 months vs. 8 ± 1 months, P = 0.01) and a lower incidence of liver metastasis (20.6% vs. 28.3%, P = 0.03). Three-year disease-free survival was higher in the PHRAC group (74.6% vs. 58.1%, P = 0.0096), as was overall survival (87.7% vs. 75.7%, P = 0.020). The median survival time was longer in the PHRAC group (40.1 ± 4.6 months vs. 36.3 ± 3.2 months, P = 0.03). The risk ratio of recurrence was 0.61 (95% CI, 0.51–0.79, P = 0.0002), of death was 0.51 (95% CI, 0.32–0.67; P = 0.009), and of liver metastasis was 0.73 (95% CI, 0.52–0.86; P = 0.02). Mild toxicities were reported.\n\nInterpretation: PHRAC combined with surgery may reduce liver metastasis and improve survival in stage III colorectal cancer patients. Trial registration: [number].
