A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Perioperative Aspirin in Vascular Surgery: A Randomised Controlled Trial\n\nBackground: The POISE-2 trial assessed the impact of perioperative aspirin on cardiovascular events and bleeding in non-cardiac surgery. This substudy focuses on the effect of aspirin in patients undergoing vascular surgery.\n\nMethods: POISE-2 was a blinded, randomised controlled trial with computer-generated randomisation and concealed allocation. Patients, clinicians, and outcome assessors were blinded. The primary outcome was a composite of death or myocardial infarction at 30 days. Secondary outcomes included vascular occlusive complications and major bleeding. The study involved 603 vascular surgery patients, with 319 in the continuation and 284 in the initiation stratum.\n\nParticipants: Eligible patients were those undergoing non-cardiac surgery, specifically vascular surgery, at multiple international sites. The study included 272 patients with occlusive disease and 265 with aneurysm surgery.\n\nResults: Among patients undergoing aneurysm repair, the primary outcome occurred in 13.7% with aspirin and 9.0% with placebo (HR 1.48, 95% CI 0.71 to 3.09). For occlusive disease surgery, 15.8% on aspirin and 13.6% on placebo experienced the primary outcome (HR 1.16, 95% CI 0.62 to 2.17). No significant interaction was found for type of surgery or aspirin stratum. Bleeding rates were similar between groups, with no significant differences in adverse events.\n\nInterpretation: The results indicate that perioperative aspirin does not significantly affect cardiovascular or vascular occlusive outcomes in vascular surgery patients, consistent with the overall POISE-2 findings. Trial registration: NCT01082874.\n\nFunding: The study was funded by [source of funding not provided in the abstract].",
