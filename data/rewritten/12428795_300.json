  "abstract": "Title: Randomised Controlled Trial of Intravenous Preemptive Analgesia in Vitreoretinal Surgery\n\nBackground: This randomised controlled trial assessed the effect of intravenous preemptive analgesia (IPA) with cyclooxygenase-3 (COX-3) inhibitors on postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV), oculocardiac reflex (OCR), and oculoemetic reflex (OER) in patients undergoing vitreoretinal surgery (VRS) under general anesthesia (GA) with Adequacy of Anesthesia (AoA) guidance.\n\nMethods: Conducted at the Department of Ophthalmology, 5th Regional Hospital in Sosnowiec, 165 patients were randomly assigned to receive AoA-guided GA with IPA of 1 g paracetamol, 2.5 g metamizole, or both. Randomisation used sealed envelopes, and allocation was concealed. The primary outcome was the incidence of PONV, OCR, and OER within 24 hours postoperatively. Blinding was applied to outcome assessors and patients. Data collection spanned January 2018 to December 2022.\n\nResults: Of the 153 patients analyzed, PONV occurred in 4%, OCR in 10%, and OER in 0%. No significant differences were observed between groups regarding IPA type. PONV was observed in 2.11% of patients with zero, one, or two risk factors, compared to 27% with at least three risk factors. The analysis was per-protocol. The effect size for PONV was not significant between groups. Adverse events were minimal and similar across groups.\n\nInterpretation: IPA with both paracetamol and metamizole did not demonstrate a benefit over single use in reducing adverse events. PONV was minimal in patients with fewer risk factors. Trial registration: NCT03389243. Funding: Not specified.",
