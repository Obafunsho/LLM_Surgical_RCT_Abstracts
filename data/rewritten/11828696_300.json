This study compared the time to lung insufflation between a surgical technique using a bougie/endotracheal tube (ETT) and an open technique using the Melker catheter.\n\nMethods: Conducted at Nepean Hospital from June 2022 to January 2023, this randomised crossover trial involved emergency physicians (EPs) and trainees trained in both techniques. Participants performed both techniques on an airway model, with the order randomised via block randomisation with random block sizes. The primary outcome was the time to first insufflation of the artificial lung. Participants were not blinded to the technique.\n\nResults: Thirty-six participants (17 EPs, 19 trainees) were randomised to perform both techniques. The Melker catheter technique was quicker, with a mean time of 29.2 seconds compared to 44.3 seconds for the bougie/ETT technique (difference 15.1 seconds, 95% CI 10.8–19.4 seconds). The Melker catheter was preferred by 61% of participants, though comfort ratings did not differ significantly. Time to insufflation was unaffected by training level or time since last cricothyrotomy. No adverse events were reported.\n\nInterpretation: The Melker catheter technique was faster and preferred by participants, suggesting it may be advantageous in emergency settings. The study was approved by the Nepean Hospital Human Research and Ethics Committee. Trial registration and funding details were not provided. The findings support the use of equipment specifically designed for cricothyrotomy, highlighting the importance of training and familiarity with the chosen technique to improve outcomes in critical scenarios. Further research could explore the impact of training videos and different airway models on performance.",
