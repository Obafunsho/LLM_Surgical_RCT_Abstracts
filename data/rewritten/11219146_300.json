A 300-word version\n\nTitle: A Randomised Controlled Trial Comparing Large-Head Metal-on-Metal and Conventional Metal-on-Polyethylene Total Hip Arthroplasty\n\nBackground: Pseudotumor formation is a known complication in metal-on-metal (MoM) total hip arthroplasty (THA). This study evaluates long-term outcomes of large-head MoM THA compared to conventional metal-on-polyethylene (MoP) THA.\n\nMethods: In this randomised controlled trial, 104 patients were randomised to receive either cementless MoM THA (50 patients) or cementless MoP THA (54 patients) between January 2006 and December 2008. Eligibility criteria included patients requiring primary THA. The primary outcome was survivorship free from revision at 10 years, analysed using Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. Pseudotumor formation was assessed via CT scan, and functional outcomes were measured using the Oxford Hip Score and Harris Hip Score. Serum ion levels were measured at 10 years. Randomisation was computer-generated, and allocation was concealed. Outcome assessors were blinded.\n\nResults: At 10 years, survivorship free from revision was similar between MoP and MoM groups (95% [95% CI 85% to 98%] vs. 92% [95% CI 82% to 98%]; p = 0.6). Pseudotumors were more frequent in the MoM group (56% vs. 22%; relative risk 1.8 [95% CI 1.2 to 2.6]; p = 0.002). Elevated cobalt and chrome levels were higher in the MoM group (19% and 14% vs. 0%; cobalt: RR 1.2 [95% CI 1.1 to 1.5]; p = 0.002; chrome: RR 1.2 [95% CI 1.0 to 1.3]; p = 0.01). No difference in functional outcomes was observed. Adverse events included pseudotumor formation and elevated ion levels.\n\nInterpretation: Large-head MoM THA showed comparable survival to MoP THA but higher pseudotumor risk and serum ion levels. Continued surveillance of MoM THA patients is recommended.\n\nTrial registration: [Trial registration number]\n\nFunding: [Source of funding]",
