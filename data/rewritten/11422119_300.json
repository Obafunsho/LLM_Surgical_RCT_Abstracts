This study aims to explore the relationship between EtCO2 levels and recurrence-free survival in pancreatic cancer surgery.\n\nMethods: This single-center, retrospective cohort study included 652 patients who underwent elective pancreatic cancer resection at Heidelberg University Hospital between 2009 and 2016. Patients were categorized into high-EtCO2 and low-EtCO2 groups based on mean intraoperative EtCO2 values. The primary outcome was recurrence-free survival, with secondary outcomes including cardiovascular events, surgical site infections, sepsis, reoperations, and overall survival.\n\nResults: The mean EtCO2 was 33.8 mmHg ±1.1 in the low-EtCO2 group and 36.8 mmHg ±1.9 in the high-EtCO2 group. The median follow-up period was 2.6 years. There was no significant difference in recurrence-free survival between the high and low EtCO2 groups [HR = 1.043 (95% CI: 0.875–1.243), p = 0.909]. Cox regression analysis indicated no correlation between mean EtCO2 levels and recurrence-free survival [Coefficient −0.004, HR = 0.996 (95% CI: 0.95–1.04); p = 0.871]. Secondary outcomes also showed no significant differences between the groups.\n\nInterpretation: The study found no association between intraoperative EtCO2 levels and recurrence-free survival or secondary outcomes in pancreatic cancer surgery. Anesthesiologists should consider factors other than oncological outcomes when setting EtCO2 targets until further evidence from prospective, multicenter randomized controlled trials is available.\n\nTrial registration: Not applicable.\n\nFunding: Not specified.",
