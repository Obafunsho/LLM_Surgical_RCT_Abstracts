A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Bupivacaine Implants for Postoperative Pain in Abdominoplasty\n\nBackground: This study evaluated the efficacy and safety of bupivacaine implants (INL-001) compared to placebo for postoperative pain management in abdominoplasty.\n\nMethods: In this multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, 366 patients undergoing abdominoplasty were randomised 1:1 to receive either three 100 mg bupivacaine implants or placebo collagen implants. The study was conducted at four centers in the USA from April to October 2021. The primary outcome was the sum of pain intensity (SPI24) over 24 hours post-treatment. Randomisation was stratified by study center and BMI, with allocation concealed using a centralized electronic system. Patients, clinicians, and outcome assessors were blinded.\n\nResults: A total of 181 patients received INL-001 and 184 received placebo. The mean SPI24 was significantly lower in the INL-001 group (102, SD 42) compared to placebo (117, SD 45; p=0.002). Adverse events were reported in 84% of INL-001 patients and 87% of placebo patients, with no systemic bupivacaine toxicity observed. The most common adverse event was back pain (7.7% INL-001 vs 7.6% placebo).\n\nInterpretation: INL-001 provided effective postoperative analgesia in abdominoplasty, aligning with the period of maximal postsurgical pain, and demonstrated a favorable safety profile. \n\nTrial registration: NCT04785625.\n\nFunding: Innocoll Pharmaceuticals.",
