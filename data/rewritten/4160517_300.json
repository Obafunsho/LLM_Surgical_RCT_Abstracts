A torsion adapter may improve transverse plane compliance and reduce torque on the residual limb, potentially enhancing mobility, pain, and fatigue.\n\nMethods: This randomised controlled trial involved 10 unilateral transtibial amputees who were randomly assigned to wear either a torsion or rigid adapter in a crossover design. Functional mobility was evaluated using an activity monitor and a 6-minute walk test with turns. Self-perceived pain was assessed using the residual limb pain grade, and fatigue was measured with the Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory. Randomisation was conducted using [randomisation method], and allocation was concealed using [allocation concealment method]. Blinding was applied to [outcome assessors/patients/clinicians].\n\nResults: Participants wearing a torsion adapter took more low- and medium-intensity steps per day (331 ± 365 and 437 ± 511 difference in steps; effect size = 0.44 and 0.17; CI, 70–592 and 71–802; p = 0.019 and 0.024, respectively) and reported less pain interference (1.9 ± 1.7 change in score; effect size = 0.83; CI, 0.3–3.4; p = 0.026). Total steps per day, distance walked in 6 minutes, and residual limb pain and fatigue were similar between groups. No adverse events were reported.\n\nInterpretation: The torsion adapter did not result in substantial improvements in functional mobility or self-perceived pain and fatigue. However, the small increases in low- and medium-intensity activities and reduced pain interference suggest potential benefits for amputees facing challenges in household and community environments.\n\nTrial registration: [Trial registration number]\n\nFunding: [Source of funding]",
