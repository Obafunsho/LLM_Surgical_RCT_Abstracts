A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Pain Education and Exercise Training in Primary Dysmenorrhea\n\nBackground: This randomised controlled trial aimed to compare the effects of pain neuroscience education (PNE) and biomedical pain education (BPE) combined with exercise training (ET) on primary dysmenorrhea (PD).\n\nMethods: Nulligravid volunteers aged 18 years and older with PD were randomly assigned to PNE+ET or BPE+ET groups. The study was conducted at a physiotherapy and rehabilitation department. The primary outcome was menstrual pain intensity, measured over two menstrual cycles. Secondary outcomes included menstrual stress, central sensitization symptoms, and pain catastrophizing. Randomisation was performed using an online tool with a block size of six, and allocation was concealed. The outcome assessors were blinded. A total of 38 participants were randomised: 19 to PNE+ET and 19 to BPE+ET, between January 2022 and June 2022. All participants were analysed using an intention-to-treat approach.\n\nResults: PNE+ET led to greater reductions in menstrual pain, central sensitization symptoms, and pain catastrophizing compared to BPE+ET (p < 0.05, Cohen’s d = 0.683–1.174). Menstrual stress decreased similarly in both groups (p > 0.05). No adverse events were reported.\n\nInterpretation: PNE combined with ET is more effective than BPE combined with ET in reducing menstrual pain, central sensitization symptoms, and pain catastrophizing in PD. Further research should explore different education parameters and physiotherapy methods. Trial registration: NCT06040866. Funding: Not specified.",
