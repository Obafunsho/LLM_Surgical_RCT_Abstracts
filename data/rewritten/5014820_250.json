The trial was conducted at a single orthopedic center. Participants were randomly assigned to either model-based RSA or marker-based RSA using computer-generated random numbers, with allocation concealment ensured by sealed envelopes. The primary outcome was the accuracy of RSA measurements, assessed using a phantom model with micromanipulators for controlled translation and rotation. Clinical precision was evaluated through double examinations of 24 patients. Blinding was applied to outcome assessors.\n\nResults: A total of 24 patients were randomised, with 12 in each group. The accuracy of model-based RSA was 0.03 mm for subsidence and 0.39° for rotation, while marker-based RSA showed 0.06 mm and 0.18°, respectively. Clinical precision for model-based RSA was 0.14 mm for subsidence and 0.79° for rotation. No adverse events were reported.\n\nInterpretation: Model-based RSA demonstrated acceptable clinical precision, though its accuracy for rotation was slightly lower than marker-based RSA. It may be suitable for clinical trials of cementless tapered wedge femoral stem designs.\n\nTrial registration: [Trial registration number]\n\nFunding: [Source of funding]",
