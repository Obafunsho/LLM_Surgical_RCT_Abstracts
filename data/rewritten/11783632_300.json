A 300-word version\n\nTitle: A Randomised Controlled Trial Comparing Chest Bioreactance and Calibrated Pulse Contour Analysis in Thoracic Cancer Surgery\n\nBackground: Monitoring cardiac output in thoracic cancer surgery is complex. This study aimed to evaluate the interchangeability of chest bioreactance and calibrated pulse contour analysis (PCA) for cardiac output measurement.\n\nMethods: Conducted at a tertiary university hospital, this prospective monocentre observational study included 50 adult patients undergoing thoracic cancer surgery. Eligibility criteria included elective unilateral thoracic cancer surgery with PCA monitoring. Simultaneous cardiac index (CI) measurements using bioreactance (CI-NICOM) and PCA calibrated by transthoracic echocardiography (CI-PCA) were taken at eight intra-operative time points. The primary outcome was the interchangeability of CI-NICOM and CI-PCA, assessed by Bland–Altman analysis and percentage error calculation. Linear regression evaluated relationships between absolute values and changes in CI.\n\nResults: CI-PCA and CI-NICOM differed significantly: 2.4 ± 0.8 vs. 2.9 ± 0.9 l min −1 m −2, respectively (P < 0.001). CI-NICOM overestimated CI by 21% with large limits of agreement (-2.49 to 1.47 l min −1 m −2). The percentage error was 77%, and concordance rates were 75% and 70% with and without an exclusion zone of 0.5 l min −1 m −2. No adverse events were reported.\n\nInterpretation: Chest bioreactance is feasible and well tolerated in thoracic cancer surgery patients. However, it is not interchangeable with calibrated PCA, showing moderate correlation and trending ability. The study highlights the need for further research before recommending bioreactance for routine goal-directed fluid therapy in this setting. Trial registration: NCT04251637. Funding: Not specified.",
