A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Cardiac Index-Guided Therapy in Major Abdominal Surgery\n\nBackground: This study aimed to determine if maintaining an optimised postinduction cardiac index during and for the first 8 hours after surgery reduces postoperative complications in high-risk patients undergoing elective major open abdominal surgery.\n\nMethods: Conducted in three German and two Spanish centres, this multicentre randomised controlled trial enrolled 380 high-risk patients. Participants were randomised to either cardiac index-guided therapy or routine care. The intervention involved maintaining a cardiac index at which pulse pressure variation was <12% using intravenous fluids and dobutamine. The primary outcome was the incidence of a composite of moderate or severe complications within 28 days post-surgery. Randomisation was computer-generated, and allocation was concealed. Patients were blinded to group allocation, but clinicians and outcome assessors were not.\n\nResults: Of the 380 enrolled, 318 were analysed (152 in the intervention group and 166 in the control group) using a modified intention-to-treat approach. The composite primary outcome occurred in 55% of the intervention group and 46% of the control group (odds ratio: 1.87, 95% CI: 1.03–3.39, P = 0.038). Per-protocol analyses confirmed these findings. No significant adverse events were reported.\n\nInterpretation: Contrary to the hypothesis, maintaining an optimised postinduction cardiac index did not reduce, and possibly increased, the incidence of complications compared to routine care. Clinicians should not aim to maintain this index in expectation of reducing complications.\n\nTrial registration: NCT03021525.\n\nFunding: Pulsion Medical Systems, Germany, and institutional and departmental sources.",
