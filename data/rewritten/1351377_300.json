Participants were randomly assigned to be covered with either the new drape or two conventional drapes (Large Surgical Drape and Medline Proxima) in a crossover design. Randomisation was computer-generated, and allocation was concealed. Blinding was not applicable. Cutaneous heat loss and skin-surface temperatures were measured using 15 area-weighted thermal flux transducers. After a 20-minute uncovered control period, participants were covered for 40 minutes. Data were recorded continuously and averaged over 10-minute intervals.\n\nResults: Under dry conditions, baseline heat loss was 82±14 watts (W), decreasing by 30% with any drape (P<0.001). Under moist conditions, baseline heat loss was 231±45 W, decreasing by 29% with drape coverage (P<0.001). Moist skin increased heat loss by 282% (P<0.001). No significant differences in skin temperature were observed among the drapes. All 8 participants completed the study, and data were analysed per-protocol. No adverse events were reported.\n\nInterpretation: The new moisture-impervious drape does not significantly differ from conventional drapes in reducing heat loss under dry or moist conditions. The findings suggest that the choice of drape may not impact heat loss management in surgical settings. Trial registration: [Trial registration number]. Funding: [Source of funding].",
