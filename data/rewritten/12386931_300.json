Patients were divided into two groups: the opioid-sparing (OS) group receiving PVB and ketamine (n = 41), and the control group treated with postoperative morphine infusion (n = 21). The primary outcome was the need for rescue opioid therapy within 48 hours post-surgery. Secondary outcomes included postoperative pain scores, chronic postoperative pain prevalence at three months, perioperative haemodynamics, and hospital length of stay.\n\nResults: Rescue opioid administration was significantly lower in the OS group (19.5% vs. 47.6%, p = 0.021). Pain control upon awakening was better in the OS group (NRS 1 [1–2] vs. 4 [3–4], p < 0.001), with no differences in pain scores thereafter. Chronic postoperative pain was less common in the OS group (23.8% vs. 52.4%, p = 0.028). No differences in haemodynamics or ketamine/PVB-related complications were reported. No difference in hospital length of stay was observed. The ketamine starting dose and postoperative morphine requirements were inversely correlated (rho = −0.380; p = 0.002).\n\nInterpretation: A multimodal analgesia protocol integrating PVB and ketamine infusion may effectively reduce postoperative opioid consumption and improve early analgesia in VATS patients. The findings suggest potential benefits in reducing chronic postoperative pain and highlight the importance of multimodal strategies in enhancing recovery after thoracic surgery. Further randomised studies are needed to confirm these results and assess the long-term benefits and safety of this approach.",
