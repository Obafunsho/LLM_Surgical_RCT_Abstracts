A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Imaging Modalities for Lobular Carcinoma Detection\n\nBackground: Lobular carcinoma (LC) presents diagnostic challenges due to its subtle imaging characteristics, often leading to delayed diagnosis. This study evaluates traditional and advanced imaging modalities for LC detection.\n\nMethods: This randomised controlled trial was conducted at a tertiary care center. Participants were women aged 40-70 with suspected LC. They were randomised into two groups: traditional imaging (mammography and ultrasound) and advanced imaging (MRI, DBT, CEM, BSGI). The primary outcome was diagnostic accuracy, measured over six months. Randomisation was computer-generated, and allocation was concealed using sealed envelopes. Outcome assessors were blinded to group allocation.\n\nResults: A total of 200 participants were randomised: 100 to the traditional imaging group and 100 to the advanced imaging group, between January 2020 and June 2021. In the intention-to-treat analysis, 98 participants in the traditional group and 97 in the advanced group were analysed. Advanced imaging showed higher diagnostic accuracy (mean difference = 15%, 95% CI 10% to 20%; p < 0.001). Adverse events were mild, with 3% in the advanced group and 1% in the traditional group experiencing mild discomfort.\n\nInterpretation: Advanced imaging modalities significantly improve diagnostic accuracy for LC compared to traditional methods. The integration of these techniques into clinical practice could enhance early detection and management of LC.\n\nTrial registration: NCT01234567\n\nFunding: This trial was funded by the National Cancer Institute.",
