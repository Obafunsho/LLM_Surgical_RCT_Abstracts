  "abstract": "1. A 250-word version\n\nBackground: This study aimed to update the 2019 EACTS/EACTA/EBCP guidelines on cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) in adult cardiac surgery, incorporating new evidence and expanding the scope to include topics such as temperature management and deep hypothermic circulatory arrest. Methods: A task force of experts conducted a systematic literature review from May to September 2023, focusing on randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and other relevant studies. The task force critically appraised the evidence and developed recommendations through consensus, with an 80% response rate and at least 75% affirmative votes required for consensus. Results: The updated guidelines include new sections on tubing materials, neuromonitoring, organ protection, blood purification, and perfusion strategies for aortic operations. The guidelines emphasize the need for further research in CPB domains and provide evidence-based recommendations where possible. Interpretation: These guidelines aim to standardize and optimize CPB techniques and perioperative management, enhancing safety and efficacy in cardiac surgery. The guidelines are intended to inform clinical practice, not replace clinical judgment, and should be adapted to each patient's unique needs. Funding: The task force was funded exclusively by EACTS, EACTAIC, and EBCP, without involvement from the healthcare industry. Trial registration: Not applicable.",
