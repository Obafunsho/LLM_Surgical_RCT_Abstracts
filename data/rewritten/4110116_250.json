A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Ultrasound Guidance for Femoral Perineural Catheters\n\nBackground: This randomised controlled trial evaluated the efficacy of ultrasound guidance alone versus ultrasound with electrical stimulation for femoral perineural catheter placement in knee arthroplasty patients. We hypothesized that ultrasound alone is noninferior in postoperative pain scores and opioid requirements.\n\nMethods: Patients undergoing knee arthroplasty were randomly assigned to one of three groups: 1) ultrasound alone (n=147); 2) ultrasound with electrical stimulation through the needle (n=152); or 3) ultrasound with electrical stimulation through both the needle and catheter (n=138). The primary outcomes were postoperative pain scores on a 0–10 Verbal Response Scale (VRS) and opioid consumption, measured over 48 hours. Randomisation was computer-generated, and allocation was concealed. Blinding was applied to outcome assessors.\n\nResults: The stimulating needle group was noninferior to the stimulating catheter group in mean VRS pain score (difference −0.16, 95% CI −0.61 to 0.29, P<0.001) and opioid consumption (percent difference −5%, 95% CI −25% to 21%, P=0.002). Ultrasound alone was faster and cheaper, with no significant adverse events reported.\n\nInterpretation: Ultrasound guidance alone is a noninferior and cost-effective method for femoral nerve catheter insertion, offering advantages in speed and cost without compromising pain management.\n\nTrial registration: [Trial registration number]\n\nFunding: [Source of funding]",
