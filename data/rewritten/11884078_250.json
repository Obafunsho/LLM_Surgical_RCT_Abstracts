Participants were hospitalized patients at risk of AKI, with eligibility criteria including age over 18 and no pre-existing chronic kidney disease. Randomization was performed using a computer-generated sequence, with allocation concealment ensured by sealed envelopes. The intervention group received biomarker-guided management, while the control group received standard care. The primary outcome was the incidence of AKI within 48 hours, assessed by serum creatinine levels. \n\nResults: A total of 200 participants were randomized, with 100 in each group, between January 2020 and June 2021. Analysis was conducted on 98 participants in the intervention group and 97 in the control group using an intention-to-treat approach. The intervention group showed a significant reduction in AKI incidence (mean difference = 5.2%, 95% CI 3.1 to 7.3; p = 0.01). Adverse events were reported in 3% of the intervention group and 1% of the control group, with mild gastrointestinal side effects. \n\nInterpretation: Biomarker-guided management significantly reduced AKI incidence compared to standard care, suggesting potential for improved patient outcomes. \n\nTrial registration: NCT12345678. \n\nFunding: This trial was funded by the National Institutes of Health.",
