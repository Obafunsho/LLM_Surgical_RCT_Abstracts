A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Second Arterial Conduit Use in Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting\n\nBackground: The benefit of a second arterial conduit in multi-vessel coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) remains unclear. This study investigates the outcomes of using a second arterial conduit compared to a venous conduit.\n\nMethods: This randomised controlled trial was conducted using a state-maintained clinical registry from 126 non-federal hospitals in California. Eligible participants were patients undergoing primary, isolated multi-vessel CABG with the left internal thoracic artery between 2006 and 2011. The intervention group received a second arterial conduit (right internal thoracic artery or radial artery), while the control group received a venous conduit. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality at 7 years. Propensity score matching using 34 preoperative characteristics was employed to create comparable groups.\n\nResults: A total of 5,866 patients received a second arterial conduit, and 53,566 received a venous conduit. Second arterial conduit use decreased from 10.7% in 2006 to 9.1% in 2011. The intervention group demonstrated significantly lower mortality (13.1% vs. 10.6%; HR 0.79, 95% CI 0.72–0.87) and reduced risks of myocardial infarction (HR 0.78, 95% CI 0.70–0.87) and repeat revascularization (HR 0.82, 95% CI 0.76–0.88). Sub-group analysis showed right internal thoracic artery grafts had similar mortality to radial artery grafts but increased sternal wound infection risk (risk difference 1.07%, 95% CI 0.15%–2.07%).\n\nInterpretation: The use of a second arterial conduit in CABG is associated with improved long-term outcomes. The radial artery may be the preferred second conduit due to a lower risk of sternal wound infection. Trial registration: Not provided. Funding: Not reported.",
