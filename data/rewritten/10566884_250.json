A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Splinting and Steroid Injection for Trigger Finger\n\nBackground: This randomised controlled trial aimed to compare the effectiveness of splinting alone, steroid injection alone, and a combination of both in reducing pain and improving function in adults with trigger finger.\n\nMethods: Conducted at an academic university hospital between May 2021 and December 2021, 120 adult patients with trigger finger were randomised into three groups: splinting (n = 43), steroid injection (n = 40), and combination therapy (n = 37). Eligibility criteria included adults without prior corticosteroid injection or concomitant hand conditions. Randomisation was performed using computer-generated block randomisation with allocation concealment via sequentially numbered, opaque, sealed envelopes. Both the allocator and outcome assessor were blinded. Primary outcomes were VAS pain reduction and MHQ score improvement at 6, 12, and 52 weeks.\n\nResults: No clinically important differences in VAS pain scores or MHQ scores were observed among the groups at any timepoint in both intention-to-treat and per-protocol analyses. No adverse events were reported.\n\nInterpretation: Splinting alone is recommended as the initial treatment for trigger finger, as it provides similar pain reduction and functional improvement compared to steroid injection alone or combination therapy. The combination of treatments does not offer additional benefits.\n\nTrial registration: [Trial registration number]\n\nFunding: [Source of funding]",
