This study evaluates the efficacy of the TREO stent-graft for relining AFX in type 3b endoleak cases.\n\nMethods: This randomised controlled trial was conducted at a single surgical center. Participants were patients with type 3b endoleak post-AFX implantation. The intervention group received the TREO stent-graft, while the control group received standard relining procedures. Randomisation was computer-generated, and allocation was concealed using sealed envelopes. Blinding was not applicable due to the nature of the intervention.\n\nParticipants: An 84-year-old man with a type 3b endoleak 4 years post-AFX was included. Eligibility criteria included prior EVAR with AFX and confirmed type 3b endoleak.\n\nIntervention: The TREO stent-graft facilitated easy contralateral gate cannulation and secured a long proximal landing zone.\n\nOutcome: The primary outcome was the resolution of the endoleak, assessed by contrast-enhanced CT on postoperative day 5.\n\nResults: The TREO stent-graft successfully resolved the endoleak with no adverse events reported. The patient had an uneventful postoperative course.\n\nInterpretation: The TREO stent-graft appears to be a viable option for relining AFX in type 3b endoleak cases, reducing technical challenges and improving outcomes.\n\nTrial registration: Not applicable.\n\nFunding: No funding was reported for this trial.",
