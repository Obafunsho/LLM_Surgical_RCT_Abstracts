A 300-word version\n\nTitle: A Randomised Controlled Trial Comparing Anterior Out-of-Plane and In-Plane Techniques for Ultrasound-Guided Subclavian Vein Cannulation\n\nBackground: Subclavian vein cannulation is a critical procedure in surgical settings. This study evaluates the efficacy of a novel anterior out-of-plane technique compared to the conventional in-plane approach for ultrasound-guided supraclavicular subclavian vein cannulation.\n\nMethods: Conducted at a tertiary care centre from January 2023 to July 2024, this single-centre, open-label, randomised controlled trial included 128 patients undergoing elective surgeries requiring central venous access. Participants were randomised to either the anterior out-of-plane or in-plane technique using a computer-generated sequence, with allocation concealment via sealed envelopes. The primary outcome was the first-pass success rate, assessed immediately post-procedure. Secondary outcomes included puncture and cannulation times, needle redirections, additional punctures, and complications. Data were analysed using independent-sample t-tests and Chi-square tests. Blinding was not feasible due to the nature of the intervention.\n\nResults: Of the 128 patients randomised, 126 were analysed (64 out-of-plane, 62 in-plane). The first-pass success rate was significantly higher in the out-of-plane group (95%) compared to the in-plane group (77%) (p < 0.05). The out-of-plane approach also demonstrated shorter puncture [9 (SD: 3) seconds] and cannulation times [148 (SD: 31) seconds] compared to the in-plane approach [17 (SD: 9) seconds and 185 (SD: 32) seconds, respectively]. Fewer complications, including arterial punctures (1 vs 5), were observed in the out-of-plane group.\n\nInterpretation: The anterior out-of-plane technique for ultrasound-guided supraclavicular subclavian vein cannulation is more successful and efficient than the in-plane approach, offering higher first-pass success rates and fewer complications.\n\nTrial registration: CTRI/2022/09/045231.
