A 250-word version\n\nTitle: A Randomised Controlled Trial Comparing MRI- and CT-based Patient-Specific Instrumentation with Conventional Instrumentation in Total Knee Arthroplasty\n\nBackground: This study aimed to compare the accuracy and clinical outcomes of MRI- and CT-based patient-specific instrumentation with conventional instrumentation in total knee arthroplasty (TKA).\n\nMethods: Ninety patients were randomised into three groups: MRI-based, CT-based patient-specific instrumentation, and conventional instrumentation. Eligibility criteria included patients undergoing primary TKA. The primary outcome was the accuracy of coronal and sagittal alignment, measured postoperatively. Secondary outcomes included component rotation, clinical outcomes (Knee Society and WOMAC scores), and duration of surgery. Randomisation was computer-generated, and allocation was concealed. Blinding was applied to outcome assessors.\n\nResults: MRI- and CT-based instrumentation showed higher accuracy in coronal limb axis compared to conventional instrumentation (MRI: 1.0° vs. 4.5°, p < 0.001; CT: 3.0° vs. 4.5°, p = 0.02). MRI-based instrumentation was more accurate than CT-based in coronal mechanical limb axis (1.0° vs. 3.0°, p = 0.03). Both patient-specific groups had reduced surgery duration compared to conventional (MRI: 58 minutes vs. 76 minutes, p < 0.001; CT: 63 minutes vs. 76 minutes, p < 0.001). No significant differences were found in postoperative Knee Society and WOMAC scores. No adverse events were reported.\n\nInterpretation: Patient-specific instrumentation improves accuracy over conventional methods, with MRI-based being more precise than CT-based for coronal alignment. However, the clinical relevance of these differences is questionable, and no long-term outcome differences were observed. Trial registration: [Trial registration number].
