A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial on the Impact of Vitamin Supplementation on Cardiovascular Health\n\nBackground: Vitamins are essential for maintaining cardiovascular function, and deficiencies may contribute to cardiovascular abnormalities. This study examines the role of vitamin supplementation in preventing cardiovascular disease (CVD).\n\nMethods: A randomised controlled trial was conducted at a cardiovascular clinic. Participants were adults with cardiovascular risk factors. Randomisation was computer-generated, and allocation was concealed using sealed envelopes. Blinding was maintained for participants, clinicians, and outcome assessors. Sample size calculation was based on detecting a significant difference in cardiovascular events.\n\nParticipants: A total of 200 participants were recruited and randomised, with 100 assigned to the intervention group and 100 to the control group.\n\nIntervention: The intervention group received a combination of hydrophilic and lipophilic vitamins, while the control group received a placebo.\n\nObjective: To assess the efficacy of vitamin supplementation in reducing the incidence of CVD.\n\nOutcome: The primary outcome was the incidence of cardiovascular events over a 12-month period.\n\nResults: Analysis was conducted on 98 participants in the intervention group and 97 in the control group using an intention-to-treat approach. The intervention group experienced a significant reduction in cardiovascular events (mean difference = 5.2 events, 95% CI 3.1 to 7.3; p = 0.01). Adverse events were mild, with 3% in the intervention group and 1% in the control group experiencing gastrointestinal side-effects.\n\nInterpretation: Vitamin supplementation may reduce the risk of CVD in individuals with cardiovascular risk factors. These findings suggest potential benefits of vitamins in CVD prevention, warranting further investigation.\n\nTrial registration: [Trial registration number]\n\nFunding: The study was funded by [source of funding].",
