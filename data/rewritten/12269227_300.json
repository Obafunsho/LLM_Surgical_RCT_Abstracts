A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial on Coagulation Management in Cardiothoracic Surgery\n\nBackground: Effective coagulation management in cardiothoracic surgery is crucial to minimize bleeding and associated complications. This study investigates the efficacy of integrating pharmacological and nonpharmacological strategies.\n\nMethods: This randomised controlled trial was conducted in a cardiothoracic surgery unit. Participants were eligible if they were scheduled for cardiothoracic surgery and met predefined criteria. The intervention group received tranexamic acid and heparin, along with nonpharmacological methods such as hemostatic agents, while the control group received standard care. The primary outcome was the reduction in postoperative bleeding, assessed over 24 hours. Randomisation was achieved through a computer-generated sequence, with allocation concealment via sealed envelopes. Outcome assessors were blinded to group assignments.\n\nResults: A total of 200 participants were randomised, with 100 assigned to each group, during the recruitment period from January 2020 to June 2021. The analysis included 98 participants in the intervention group and 97 in the control group, following an intention-to-treat approach. The intervention group experienced a significant reduction in postoperative bleeding (mean difference = 5.2 mL, 95% CI 3.1 to 7.3; p = 0.01). Adverse events were observed in 3% of the intervention group and 1% of the control group, with mild gastrointestinal side-effects reported.\n\nInterpretation: The integration of pharmacological and nonpharmacological strategies effectively reduces postoperative bleeding in cardiothoracic surgery. These findings support the adoption of a multifaceted approach to coagulation management. Future studies should evaluate the long-term outcomes and cost-effectiveness of these strategies, particularly in high-risk populations.\n\nTrial registration: N/A\n\nFunding: The study was funded by [source not provided].",
