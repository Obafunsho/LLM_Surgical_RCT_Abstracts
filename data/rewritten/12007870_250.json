The Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations (GRADE) criteria were applied by both AI and human reviewers to assess the quality of evidence. The primary outcome was the quality of evidence scores assigned by AI and humans.\n\nResults: Eighteen studies involving 3131 patients were reviewed. Seven studies addressed length of stay, with five showing shorter stays with NPWT. Fourteen studies examined infection rates, with eight finding significant improvement using NPWT. Twelve articles analyzed time to wound closure, with nine reporting reduced time with NPWT. AI generally assigned lower quality of evidence scores compared to humans.\n\nInterpretation: AI shows promise in supporting systematic reviews but remains limited in accurately determining evidence quality. AI's lower scores may reflect reduced bias. The study highlights the challenges in producing high-level evidence for NPWT due to trial design issues and the diversity of its application. No adverse events were reported. The trial was not registered, and no funding source was disclosed.",
