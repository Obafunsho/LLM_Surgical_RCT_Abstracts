A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Early Active Mobilization vs. Immobilization After Tibialis Posterior Tendon Transfer: A Randomized Controlled Trial\n\nBackground: This randomized controlled trial evaluated early active mobilization versus immobilization after tibialis posterior tendon transfer for foot-drop correction in patients with Hansen’s disease.\n\nMethods: We randomized 24 patients with irreversible common peroneal nerve paralysis to early mobilization (n=13) or immobilization (n=11) post-surgery. The trial was conducted at a single institution from July 2005 to June 2006. Randomization was performed using sealed opaque envelopes, and allocation was concealed until after surgery. The primary outcome was rehabilitation time, defined as the period from surgery to independent walking, measured over a minimum follow-up of 16 months. Blinding was not possible for therapists, but outcome assessors were blinded. A power analysis indicated a sample size of 10 per group was sufficient to detect a 10-day difference in rehabilitation time.\n\nResults: No tendon insertion pullout was observed in either group. Rehabilitation time was significantly reduced in the mobilized group by an average of 15 days (p<0.001). Functional outcomes, including active ankle dorsiflexion, plantar flexion, and ROM, were similar between groups. No adverse events were reported.\n\nInterpretation: Early active mobilization after tendon transfer for foot-drop correction in Hansen’s disease patients is safe and reduces rehabilitation time without compromising functional outcomes compared to immobilization.\n\nTrial registration: Not provided.\n\nFunding: Not specified.",
