A 300-word version\n\nBackground: The increasing use of transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) for severe aortic stenosis necessitates understanding the durability of these prostheses.\n\nMethods: This randomized controlled trial evaluated echocardiographic data from the Placement of Aortic Transcatheter Valves (PARTNER) 1 Trial. Participants were randomized to TAVR or surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) in PARTNER 1A (TAVR, n=321; SAVR, n=313) and TAVR or medical treatment in PARTNER 1B (TAVR, n=165). Continued access studies included 1996 TAVR patients. The primary outcome was death or reintervention for aortic valve structural indications, assessed over a median follow-up of 3.1 years. Randomization was computer-generated, and allocation was concealed. Blinding was not specified. Eligibility criteria included severe aortic stenosis, and the study was conducted across multiple centers.\n\nResults: Of 2795 patients (mean age 84.5 years, 47% female), 424 TAVR and 49 SAVR patients had 5-year echocardiogram data. TAVR showed early favorable hemodynamic changes, with a decrease of −2.9 mm Hg in aortic valve mean gradient, an increase of 0.028 in Doppler velocity index, and an increase of 0.09 cm² in effective orifice area, with stability over time. Moderate/severe transvalvular regurgitation occurred in 3.7% of TAVR patients. Reintervention was infrequent (0.8% TAVR, 0.3% SAVR). No significant adverse events were reported.\n\nInterpretation: TAVR and SAVR demonstrated excellent durability, with rare valve thrombosis or structural deterioration. Abnormal findings in individual patients require further investigation. Trial registration: NCT00530894. Funding: Not specified.",
