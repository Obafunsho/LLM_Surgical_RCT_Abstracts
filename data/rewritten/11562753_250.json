A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Noninvasive Focused Ultrasound for Chronic Pain\n\nBackground: Chronic pain affects a significant portion of the population, and current surgical interventions targeting the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) are invasive. This study evaluates a noninvasive focused ultrasound approach to modulate the ACC for pain relief.\n\nMethods: This double-blind, randomised, sham-controlled crossover trial was conducted at the University of Utah. Participants aged 18-65 with chronic pain were randomised to receive either active or sham ultrasound stimulation. The primary outcome was the reduction in pain intensity, measured using the Brief Pain Inventory over a 7-day period. Randomisation was computer-generated, and allocation was concealed. Both participants and outcome assessors were blinded.\n\nResults: Twenty-three participants were randomised, with 20 completing the study. Active stimulation resulted in a 60% reduction in pain immediately post-intervention, 43% on day 1, and 33% on day 7. Sham stimulation resulted in reductions of 14.4%, 12.3%, and 6.6%, respectively. The effect size was significant (p < 0.05). No serious adverse events were reported; mild side effects resolved within 24 hours.\n\nInterpretation: Noninvasive focused ultrasound targeting the ACC provides rapid and durable pain relief, offering a promising alternative to surgical interventions. \n\nTrial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT05674903\n\nFunding: Supported by the University of Utah.",
