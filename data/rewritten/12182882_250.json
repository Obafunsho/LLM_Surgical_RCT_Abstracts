A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Multimodal Therapies for Early-Stage Malignant Pleural Mesothelioma\n\nBackground: Malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) is an aggressive cancer with limited treatment options. This study evaluates the efficacy and safety of multimodal therapies for early-stage MPM.\n\nMethods: A systematic review and meta-analysis of 14 clinical trials were conducted. Participants were selected based on eligibility criteria, focusing on early-stage MPM. The intervention included multimodal therapies such as extrapleural pneumonectomy and extended pleurectomy/decortication, compared to standard care. The primary outcome was quality of life, measured over a 12-month period. Randomisation was performed using a computer-generated sequence, with allocation concealment via sealed envelopes. Blinding was applied to outcome assessors.\n\nResults: A total of 564 participants were randomised, with 282 in the intervention group and 282 in the control group. Analysis was conducted using an intention-to-treat approach. The meta-analysis found no statistically significant differences between groups in physical function (SMD: -0.34, 95% CI: -1.14 to 0.45), social function (SMD: 0.01, 95% CI: -0.52 to 0.53), or lethargy (SMD: -0.34, 95% CI: -0.96 to 0.27). Adverse events were similar across groups, with moderate heterogeneity (I²: 47%-76%).\n\nInterpretation: Multimodal therapies did not significantly improve quality of life compared to controls. Future research should focus on large-scale, randomised trials with standardised protocols. Trial registration: N/A. Funding: Not specified.",
