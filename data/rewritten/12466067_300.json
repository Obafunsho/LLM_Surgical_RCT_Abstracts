A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Sugammadex on Postoperative Urinary Retention\n\nBackground: Postoperative urinary retention (POUR) is a frequent complication following general anesthesia. This study evaluates the effects of sugammadex, a neuromuscular blockade (NMB) reversal agent, on POUR incidence and other postoperative outcomes.\n\nMethods: This meta-analysis included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and cohort studies comparing sugammadex with conventional reversal agents or no reversal agents. The primary outcome was POUR incidence, measured within 30 days post-surgery. Secondary outcomes included postoperative pain scores (POPS) and 30-day readmission rates. PubMed, Cochrane, Embase, and Web of Science were searched for studies published through June 3, 2024. Statistical analysis was conducted using Stata 15.1. Randomisation and allocation concealment methods were not specified. Blinding details were not provided.\n\nResults: A total of 25 studies with 163,367 patients were included: 84,362 received sugammadex, and 79,005 received neostigmine or no antagonist. Sugammadex significantly reduced POUR incidence (Relative Risk (RR): 0.47, 95% Confidence Interval (CI): 0.34–0.64, P < 0.001). No significant differences were observed in POPS (Standardized Mean Difference (SMD): -0.01, 95% CI: -0.43–0.40, P = 0.945) or 30-day readmission rates (RR: 0.81, 95% CI: 0.65–1.01, P = 0.057). Adverse events were not reported.\n\nInterpretation: Sugammadex significantly reduces POUR incidence without affecting POPS or 30-day readmission rates. Further research is needed to explore its role in diverse surgical procedures and patient populations. The study highlights the potential of sugammadex in improving postoperative recovery by reducing POUR. Trial registration: CRD42024566663. Funding: Not specified.",
