Exclusion criteria included other upper-limb symptoms and prior elbow surgery. Participants were randomised (1:1:1) using computer-generated sequences, concealed from investigators, to receive PRP, autologous blood, or saline injections. The primary outcome was pain improvement on the VAS scale at 52 weeks. Secondary outcomes included DASH score and grip strength. Intention-to-treat analysis was performed.\n\nResults: A total of 119 participants were randomised: 40 to PRP, 40 to autologous blood, and 39 to saline. At 52 weeks, 31 PRP, 38 autologous blood, and 32 saline participants were analysed. No clinically important differences were observed in VAS pain or DASH scores among groups. The mean VAS pain difference was -0.2 (95% CI -1.5 to 1.1; p = 0.75) for PRP vs. saline and 0.5 (95% CI -0.7 to 1.7; p = 0.40) for autologous blood vs. saline. The corresponding mean differences in DASH scores were 0.0 (95% CI -9.2 to 9.2; p > 0.99) and 7.7 (95% CI -1.3 to 16.7; p = 0.09). No adverse events were reported.\n\nInterpretation: PRP and autologous blood injections did not improve pain or function compared to saline at 1 year. The 95% CIs did not exclude the MCID for autologous blood vs. saline, suggesting a larger study might detect a small effect. Until further evidence is available, these treatments are not recommended.
