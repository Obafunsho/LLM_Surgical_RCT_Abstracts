A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Autologous Bone Marrow Mononuclear Cells for Critical Limb Ischaemia\n\nBackground: Peripheral arterial disease can progress to critical limb ischaemia (CLI), often necessitating amputation. This study evaluates the efficacy of intramuscular transplantation of autologous bone marrow mononuclear cells (BMMNCs) in CLI patients.\n\nMethods: We conducted a randomised controlled trial involving 176 participants diagnosed with CLI. Participants were randomly allocated to receive either intramuscular BMMNCs or control (conventional therapy, diluted autologous peripheral blood, or saline). The primary outcomes were all-cause mortality, pain, and amputation, assessed over a 12-month period. Randomisation was computer-generated, and allocation was concealed. Blinding was not specified.\n\nResults: A total of 176 participants were randomised: 88 to the BMMNC group and 88 to the control group. Analysis was intention-to-treat. There was no significant effect on mortality (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.15 to 6.63). Pain reduction was inconsistent across studies, with one study showing greater reduction in the BMMNC group. Amputation rates showed a possible small effect (RR 0.52, 95% CI 0.27 to 0.99), but this was not significant after sensitivity analysis. No significant differences were observed in side effects (RR 2.13, 95% CI 0.50 to 8.97).\n\nInterpretation: The evidence from this trial is of very low to low certainty, and we cannot conclusively support the use of BMMNCs for CLI. Larger trials are needed to determine the efficacy of this intervention.\n\nTrial registration: Not provided.\n\nFunding: Not specified.",
