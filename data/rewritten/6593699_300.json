A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Magnetic Seed Localization for Index Node Removal in Stage III Melanoma\n\nBackground: This pilot study assessed the feasibility and reliability of magnetic seed localization for targeted index lymph node removal as a response indicator after neoadjuvant checkpoint inhibition therapy in patients with stage III melanoma.\n\nMethods: Conducted at the Netherlands Cancer Institute, 12 patients with resectable stage III melanoma and measurable lymph node metastasis were randomly assigned to one of three ipilimumab plus nivolumab combination schemes. A magnetic seed was placed in the largest lymph node, which was surgically removed after 6 weeks of therapy. The primary outcome was the congruence of therapeutic response between the index node and the total lymph node basin, evaluated using the International Neoadjuvant Melanoma Consortium scoring system. Randomization and allocation concealment methods were not specified. Blinding was not applied.\n\nResults: All 12 magnetic seeds were successfully detected and removed. The index node response was congruent with the total basin response in all cases. Seven patients achieved a pathological complete response (pCR), three had a near-pCR, one had a pathological partial response, and one had no response. No adverse events related to the magnetic seed localization were reported. The magnetic technology was rated highly by surgeons for usability and future application.\n\nInterpretation: Magnetic seed localization is a feasible and reliable method for targeted index node removal in stage III melanoma, potentially allowing patients with a (near-)complete response to avoid completion lymph node dissection. These promising results warrant further investigation in larger, adequately powered trials to confirm the potential benefits and cost-effectiveness of this approach.\n\nTrial registration: NL58293.031.16\n\nFunding: Not specified.",
