A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Individualized Ventilation in Frail Patients Undergoing Non-Cardiac Surgery\n\nBackground: Frailty increases the risk of postoperative pulmonary complications (PPCs) in surgical patients. This study aimed to compare the effects of driving pressure-guided individualized ventilation versus standard positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) ventilation on PPCs in frail patients undergoing non-cardiac surgery.\n\nMethods: In this prospective, randomized controlled trial, 61 frail patients aged ≥65 years undergoing elective non-cardiac surgery at the First People’s Hospital of Xiangshan County were enrolled between January and December 2024. Participants were randomized to either the individualized PEEP group (n=31) or the standard PEEP group (n=30). The primary outcome was the incidence of PPCs within 7 days postoperatively. Randomization was performed using a pre-established allocation list, and outcome assessors were blinded to group assignments.\n\nResults: No PPCs occurred in the individualized PEEP group, while 7 patients (23.3%) in the standard PEEP group developed PPCs (p<0.01). The individualized PEEP group showed significantly lower plateau pressure and airway pressure and improved dynamic lung compliance at T0 (p<0.001). No significant differences were observed in arterial oxygen pressure or oxygenation index throughout the study (p>0.05).\n\nInterpretation: Driving pressure-guided individualized ventilation significantly reduced PPCs and improved perioperative respiratory parameters in frail patients undergoing non-cardiac surgery. This strategy may optimize intraoperative ventilation in high-risk surgical patients.\n\nTrial registration: Not provided.\n\nFunding: Not specified.",
