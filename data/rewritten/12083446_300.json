A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Impact of Transit-Time Flow Measurement on Postoperative Outcomes in Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting: A Retrospective Analysis\n\nBackground: This study aimed to evaluate the impact of transit-time flow measurement (TTFM) on early postoperative outcomes in total arterial coronary revascularization.\n\nMethods: A single-centre retrospective analysis was conducted on 910 patients undergoing isolated total arterial coronary artery bypass grafting with internal thoracic arteries (ITAs) at our institution between January 2017 and February 2020. Participants were divided based on the use of TTFM: 430 patients in the TTFM group and 480 in the no TTFM group. The primary outcome was the occurrence of in-hospital major cardiac adverse events (MACE), including mortality, myocardial infarction, and need for revascularization. A propensity score analysis with an inverse probability weighting approach was used to control for selection bias.\n\nResults: TTFM was associated with longer cardiopulmonary bypass times (76.0 [62.0; 91.2] vs 79.0 [65.0; 94.0] min, P = 0.042). Six (1.4%) patients in the TTFM group underwent intraoperative graft revision due to unsatisfactory flow values, compared to none in the no TTFM group (P = 0.011). MACE were significantly lower in the TTFM group (14, 3.3%) than in the no TTFM group (33, 6.9%, P = 0.014). TTFM was protective against MACE occurrence (odds ratio 0.46, 95% CI 0.23–0.85, P = 0.016). Inverse probability weighting adjustment confirmed the protective effect of TTFM (odds ratio 0.44, 95% CI 0.28–0.69, P < 0.001).\n\nInterpretation: Despite longer cardiopulmonary bypass times, TTFM reduces MACE occurrence and should be recommended for graft evaluation in arterial coronary artery bypass grafting surgery. Further studies are needed to confirm these findings and explore the potential for TTFM to improve long-term outcomes.",
