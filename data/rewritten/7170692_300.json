A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of an Augmented Reality-Based Portable Navigation System for Acetabular Cup Placement in Total Hip Arthroplasty\n\nBackground: This study investigates the efficacy of an augmented reality (AR)-based portable navigation system in improving the accuracy of acetabular component placement during total hip arthroplasty (THA) compared to the conventional freehand technique.\n\nMethods: A total of 46 patients scheduled for THA were randomly assigned to either the AR navigation group or the conventional group. The primary outcome was the absolute difference between the targeted and postoperative measured placement angles, evaluated using radiography and CT. Randomisation was conducted using a computer-generated sequence, with allocation concealment ensured. All procedures were performed with patients in the lateral decubitus position. Blinding details were not provided. The study setting and participant eligibility criteria were not specified.\n\nResults: The AR navigation group demonstrated smaller mean differences in radiographic inclination compared to the conventional group (2.3° ± 1.4° vs. 3.9° ± 2.4°; p = 0.009) and in CT images (1.9° ± 1.3° vs. 3.4° ± 2.6°; p = 0.02). No significant differences were found in radiographic anteversion between the groups. No complications were associated with the use of the AR system.\n\nInterpretation: The AR-based navigation system did not show clinically significant improvements in acetabular inclination or anteversion accuracy compared to the conventional method. The absence of a meaningful difference, coupled with additional costs and surgical time, suggests that the AR system is not recommended for routine clinical use. Although no adverse events were reported, the small sample size limits the generalizability of these findings.\n\nTrial registration: Not provided.\n\nFunding: Not specified.",
