This study aimed to identify biomarkers and mechanisms of DPM-induced myocardial hypoxia injury.\n\nMethods: A cohort of diesel engine testers (DETs) with stable DPM exposure was studied. Participants underwent electrocardiogram and echocardiogram examinations, serum myocardial enzyme assessments, and a 6-min walking test. A mouse model exposed to occupational DPM doses and in vitro models were used to assess mitochondrial aerobic metabolism. Ion fluorescence probes, ion supplements, and mitochondrial RNA splicing protein 2 (Mrs2) overexpression transfection were employed to investigate mitochondrial Mg²⁺ deficiency mechanisms.\n\nResults: Compromised myocardial mitochondrial aerobic metabolism was identified as a precursor biomarker for myocardial hypertrophy and hypoxia injury in DPM exposure. DPM induced mitochondrial Mg²⁺ deficiency, disrupting aerobic metabolism processes, including the tricarboxylic acid cycle, oxidative phosphorylation, and ATP synthesis. Mg²⁺ deficiency was mediated by the disruption of Mg²⁺ transport proteins, such as DPM-enhanced hyperubiquitination and degradation of Mrs2.\n\nInterpretation: Compromised mitochondrial aerobic metabolism, associated with Mg²⁺ deficiency, serves as a critical biomarker for DPM-induced IHD and represents a promising avenue for intervention.\n\nTrial registration: Not provided.\n\nFunding: Not specified.",
