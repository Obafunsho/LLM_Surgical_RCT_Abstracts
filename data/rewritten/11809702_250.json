  "abstract": "Title: A Randomised Controlled Trial of Autologous Skin Cell Suspension with Split-Thickness Skin Grafting for Nonthermal Skin Defects\n\nBackground: This randomised controlled trial evaluated the efficacy of autologous skin cell suspension (ASCS) combined with split-thickness skin grafting (STSG) in reducing donor skin requirements for full-thickness nonthermal skin defects.\n\nMethods: Conducted at 18 centers in the United States, 65 patients aged 5 years or older with acute full-thickness nonthermal skin defects were randomised 1:1 to receive either standard meshed STSG (control) or ASCS+STSG. Randomisation was performed using sealed envelopes, and outcome assessors were blinded. The primary outcomes were noninferiority of ASCS+STSG for complete closure by 8 weeks and superiority in reducing donor skin area. Sample size was calculated to provide ≥80% power for both primary endpoints.\n\nResults: Of 65 randomised patients, 52 were analysed per protocol. At 8 weeks, complete closure was achieved in 65% of ASCS+STSG areas versus 58% of control areas (p = 0.005), confirming noninferiority. ASCS+STSG required 27.4% less donor skin (p < 0.001), establishing superiority. Clinical healing (≥95% reepithelialization) was similar between groups. Safety profiles were comparable, with no serious ASCS device-related events.\n\nInterpretation: ASCS+STSG effectively reduces donor skin requirements without compromising healing or safety, potentially decreasing donor site morbidity and healthcare costs.
