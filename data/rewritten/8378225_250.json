A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Open-Label Placebo and Conditioning in Postoperative Pain Management: A Randomised Controlled Trial\n\nBackground: This study investigates the efficacy of combining conditioning with open-label placebos (COLP) to reduce opioid use and postsurgical pain in spine surgery patients.\n\nMethods: In this randomised controlled trial, patients undergoing spine surgery were randomised to either the COLP group or a treatment-as-usual group. The unit of randomisation was the individual patient. Both groups had unrestricted access to a standard opioid-based postoperative analgesic regimen. The primary outcome was daily opioid consumption measured in morphine milligram equivalents from postoperative day (POD) 1 to POD 17. Randomisation was computer-generated, and allocation was concealed using sealed envelopes. Blinding was not applied to patients or clinicians, but outcome assessors were blinded. A total of 200 participants were randomised: 100 to the COLP group and 100 to the control group. The analysis was conducted on an intention-to-treat basis.\n\nResults: Patients in the COLP group consumed 30% less daily morphine milligram equivalents compared to the control group (−14.5; 95% CI: [−26.8, −2.2]). Daily worst pain scores were lower in the COLP group (−2.0; 95% CI: [−2.0, −0.1]), but no significant difference was found in average daily pain (−0.8; 95% CI: [−1.7, 0.2]). No adverse events were reported.\n\nInterpretation: COLP may be a viable adjuvant analgesic therapy to reduce opioid consumption post-surgery without increasing pain.
