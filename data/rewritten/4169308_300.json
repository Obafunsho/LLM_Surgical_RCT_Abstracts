A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Sodium Nitroprusside for Blood Pressure Control in Pediatric Surgery\n\nBackground: Sodium nitroprusside (SNP) is used to decrease arterial blood pressure (BP) during certain surgical procedures. This study aimed to evaluate the dose-response relationship of SNP in infants and children undergoing major surgery and to perform a quantitative assessment of BP control.\n\nMethods: In this randomised controlled trial, 153 subjects at 7 sites were randomised to receive a blinded infusion followed by open-label SNP during operative procedures requiring controlled hypotension. SNP was administered by continuous infusion and titrated to maintain BP control (mean arterial BP [MAP] within ±10% of clinician-defined target). BP was recorded using an arterial catheter. Statistical Process Control methodology was used to quantify BP control. A multivariable model assessed the effects of patient and procedural factors. Randomisation and allocation concealment methods were not specified. Blinding was applied to outcome assessors. Participants were eligible if they were infants or children undergoing major surgery. The study setting included multiple surgical centers.\n\nResults: BP was controlled an average of 45.4% (SD 23.9%, 95% CI 41.5%-49.18%) of the time. Larger changes in infusion rate were associated with worse BP control (7.99% less control for 1 mcg•kg−1•min−1 increase in average titration size, p=0.0009). A larger difference between a patient's baseline and target MAP predicted worse BP control (0.93% worse control per 1 mmHg increase in MAP difference, p=0.0013). No adverse events were reported. The analysis approach was not specified.\n\nInterpretation: SNP was effective in reducing BP, but BP was within the target range less than half of the time. No clinician or patient factors were predictive of BP control. Further study is needed to improve dosing strategies.\n\nTrial registration: Not specified. Funding: Not specified.",
