A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Fibrin Sealant Patch in Reducing Postoperative Pancreatic Fistula\n\nBackground: This multicentre, randomised controlled trial aimed to assess the effectiveness of a fibrin sealant patch in reducing postoperative pancreatic fistula (POPF) in patients undergoing pancreatoduodenectomy with pancreatojejunostomy.\n\nMethods: Conducted in six Austrian tertiary-care centres, 142 patients aged 18 years or older were randomised 1:1 to receive either a fibrin-coated collagen patch (patch group) or no patch (control group). Randomisation was stratified by gland texture, pancreatic duct size, and neoadjuvant treatment, using a secure internet-based service for allocation concealment. The primary outcome was POPF, assessed up to 42 days post-surgery. Secondary outcomes included postoperative complications, drain-related factors, and hospital stay duration. Blinding was not applied.\n\nResults: From September 2013 to March 2015, 71 patients were randomised to each group. All 142 patients were analysed using an intention-to-treat approach. POPF occurred in 63% of the patch group and 56% of the control group (p=0.392). Fistulas were classified as grade B or C in 23% and 14% of patients, respectively (p=0.277). No significant differences were observed in postoperative complications, drain amylase concentration, time to drain removal, fistula closure, or hospital stay. Multivariable logistic regression identified obesity (OR 5.28, 95% CI 1.20 to 23.18; p=0.027), soft gland texture (OR 9.86, 95% CI 3.41 to 28.54; p<0.001), and small duct size (OR 5.50, 95% CI 1.84 to 16.44; p=0.002) as significant risk factors for POPF. Adverse events were similar between groups.\n\nInterpretation: The fibrin sealant patch did not reduce the incidence of POPF or complications. Trial registration: EudraCT 2013-000639-29.
