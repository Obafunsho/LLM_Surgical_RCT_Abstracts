A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of an Augmented Reality-Based Portable Navigation System for Acetabular Cup Placement in Total Hip Arthroplasty\n\nBackground: This study evaluates the accuracy of acetabular component placement using an augmented reality (AR)-based portable navigation system compared to the conventional freehand technique during total hip arthroplasty (THA).\n\nMethods: In this randomised controlled trial, 46 patients undergoing THA were randomly assigned to either the AR navigation group or the conventional group. The primary outcome was the absolute difference between the targeted and postoperative measured placement angles, assessed using radiography and CT. Randomisation was performed using a computer-generated sequence, and allocation was concealed. The study was conducted with patients in the lateral decubitus position. Blinding was not specified.\n\nResults: The AR navigation group showed smaller mean differences in radiographic inclination compared to the conventional group (2.3° ± 1.4° vs. 3.9° ± 2.4°; p = 0.009) and in CT images (1.9° ± 1.3° vs. 3.4° ± 2.6°; p = 0.02). No significant differences were observed in radiographic anteversion between groups. No complications were reported with the AR system.\n\nInterpretation: The AR-based system did not demonstrate clinically meaningful differences in acetabular inclination or anteversion accuracy compared to the conventional method. Given the lack of significant improvement and additional costs, the AR system is not recommended for routine use. No adverse events were noted, but the small sample size limits the generalizability of these findings.\n\nTrial registration: Not provided.\n\nFunding: Not specified.",
