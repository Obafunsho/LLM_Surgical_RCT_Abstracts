This study evaluates the clinical applications of conditioning techniques to mitigate IR injury.\n\nMethods: This randomised controlled trial was conducted in a tertiary care setting. Participants included patients undergoing surgical procedures with a risk of IR injury. Eligibility criteria encompassed adults with diagnosed ischemic conditions. Participants were randomised into intervention and control groups using a computer-generated sequence, with allocation concealment via sealed envelopes. Blinding was applied to outcome assessors.\n\nIntervention: The intervention group received ischemic preconditioning (IPC) or remote ischemic preconditioning (RIPC), while the control group received standard care.\n\nObjective: To assess the efficacy of conditioning techniques in reducing IR injury.\n\nOutcome: The primary outcome was the reduction in biomarkers of organ damage, measured over 72 hours post-intervention.\n\nResults: A total of 200 participants were randomised, with 100 in each group. Analysis included 98 in the intervention group and 97 in the control group, using an intention-to-treat approach. The intervention group showed a significant reduction in biomarkers (mean difference = 5.2, 95% CI 3.1 to 7.3; p = 0.01). Adverse events were mild, with 3% in the intervention group and 1% in the control group.\n\nTrial registration: N/A\n\nFunding: The study was funded by institutional grants.",
