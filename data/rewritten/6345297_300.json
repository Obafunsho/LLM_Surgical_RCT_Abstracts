A 300-word version\n\nTitle: A Randomised Controlled Trial Comparing Direct Anterior and Direct Lateral Approaches in Total Hip Arthroplasty\n\nBackground: The direct lateral approach to total hip arthroplasty (THA) provides good exposure but may damage abductor muscles, while the direct anterior approach avoids muscle incision but has a learning curve and potential complications. This study compares these approaches regarding patient-reported outcomes, abductor weakness, and major complications.\n\nMethods: In this randomised controlled trial, 164 patients with end-stage osteoarthritis were recruited from January 2012 to June 2013 and randomised to either the direct anterior or direct lateral approach. The primary outcome was the Harris hip score (HHS) measured at 3, 6, 12, and 24 months. Randomisation was computer-generated, and allocation was concealed. Assessors were blinded to the surgical approach. One hundred fifty-four patients (94%) completed the 2-year follow-up, with five patients from each group lost to follow-up. Analysis was conducted on an intention-to-treat basis.\n\nResults: No clinically important differences were found in HHS, 6-minute walk distance, Oxford Hip Score, or EQ-5D between groups. A higher proportion of patients had a positive Trendelenburg test at 24 months in the lateral approach group (16% [12 of 75] vs. 1% [one of 79]; odds ratio, 15; p = 0.001). Irrespective of approach, those with a positive Trendelenburg test had worse HHS, OHS, and EQ-5D scores. Four major nerve injuries occurred in the anterior group (three transient femoral nerve injuries and one persistent tibial nerve injury), with none in the lateral group.\n\nInterpretation: The direct anterior approach reduced postoperative Trendelenburg test positivity compared to the lateral approach but was associated with nerve injuries. Ensuring good abductor function is crucial in THA. Trial registration: [Trial registration number]. Funding: [Source of funding].",
