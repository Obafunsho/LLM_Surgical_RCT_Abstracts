Participants were randomised 1:1 to receive either ESPB or QLB with 25 mL of 0.4% ropivacaine. The primary outcome was cumulative morphine consumption within 6 hours postoperatively. Secondary outcomes included pain scores, morphine pump activations, QoR-15 scores, and length of hospital stay. Randomisation was computer-generated, and allocation was concealed using opaque envelopes. Blinding was maintained for patients, clinicians, and outcome assessors.\n\nResults: Of the 54 patients randomised, 27 were allocated to each group. ESPB resulted in significantly lower morphine consumption within 6 hours postoperatively compared to QLB (mean difference: 2.52 mg, 95% CI: 0.15–4.89; P=0.04). ESPB also led to lower early pain scores, fewer morphine pump activations, higher QoR-15 scores at 24 and 48 hours, and shorter hospital stays (P<0.05 for all). No block-related complications were observed in either group.\n\nInterpretation: ESPB may offer superior early postoperative analgesia and recovery benefits compared to QLB in laparoscopic nephrectomy. These findings suggest that ESPB could be a valuable option for perioperative pain management in this surgical context. However, as an exploratory study with a limited sample size, further validation in larger populations is necessary.\n\nTrial Registration: Chinese Clinical Trial Registry, ChiCTR2300074743.\n\nFunding: Not specified.",
