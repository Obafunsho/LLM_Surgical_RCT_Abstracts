A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Tranexamic Acid in Total Hip Arthroplasty\n\nBackground: Tranexamic acid (TXA) is commonly used to reduce blood loss in total hip arthroplasty (THA), but its effect on fibrinolysis has not been studied. We hypothesized no difference in fibrinolysis and blood loss between TXA and placebo.\n\nMethods: This double-blind, randomised controlled trial included 50 patients undergoing primary THA at Thomas Jefferson University Hospital from April 2019 to December 2021. Participants were aged 18–85 years, ASA Physical Status 1–3. Patients were randomised 1:1 to receive either TXA (10 mg/kg) or placebo (0.9% sodium chloride). The primary outcome was fibrinolysis, defined as maximum lysis (ML) >15% within 1 hour, measured by rotational thromboelastometry (ROTEM). Randomisation used a permuted block design, with allocation concealed by opaque envelopes. Patients, surgeons, and assessors were blinded.\n\nResults: 22 patients received TXA and 25 received placebo. ROTEM showed no fibrinolysis in either group, with similar NATEM and T-APTEM variables. No significant differences in clinical outcomes, including blood loss and coagulation profiles, were observed. Two thrombotic events occurred in the placebo group.\n\nInterpretation: TXA did not affect fibrinolysis or clinical outcomes in THA patients without preexisting fibrinolytic conditions. ROTEM may guide selective TXA use in high-risk patients.\n\nTrial registration: NCT03897621.\n\nFunding: Department of Anesthesiology, Thomas Jefferson University Hospital.",
