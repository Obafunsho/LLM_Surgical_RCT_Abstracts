  "abstract": "1. A 250-word version\n\nBackground: This study aimed to assess the safety and efficacy of preoperative glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RA) in elective surgical systems. \n\nMethods: A systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted, searching PubMed, MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane Library up to March 31, 2025, for studies on preoperative GLP-1 RA use in adults undergoing elective surgery. The primary outcome was perioperative safety, defined as any complication within 90 days post-surgery. Secondary outcomes included preoperative weight loss. Both frequentist and Bayesian random-effects meta-analyses were performed. The study is registered with PROSPERO, CRD420251027809.\n\nResults: A total of 21 studies, involving 97,059 patients, met inclusion criteria; 31.9% (n = 30,981) received preoperative GLP-1 RA therapy. No randomised trials were identified. Postoperative complications were reported in 12 studies, with no increased risk in GLP-1 users (pooled OR: 0.78, 95% CI: 0.59–1.05). High heterogeneity was observed (I² = 73%). Bayesian analysis yielded consistent findings (posterior mean OR: 0.78; 95% credible interval: 0.57–1.12). The overall GRADE assessment for certainty of evidence was very low. Preoperative GLP-1 RA use was associated with weight loss of up to 16.7 kg or 6.0 kg/m² over six months.\n\nInterpretation: Preoperative GLP-1 RA therapy may support weight loss without increased perioperative risk, offering a scalable strategy for surgical optimisation. However, the certainty of evidence is very low, necessitating robust randomised trials. \n\nFunding: NIHR Doctoral Research Fellowship and NIHR Exeter Biomedical Research Centre Senior Investigator Fellowship.",
