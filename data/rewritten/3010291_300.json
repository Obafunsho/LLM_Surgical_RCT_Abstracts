A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Biventricular Pacing in Cardiac Surgery Patients\n\nBackground: This study evaluates the impact of temporary biventricular pacing with optimized atrioventricular and interventricular delays on cardiac output in patients with left ventricular dysfunction undergoing cardiac surgery.\n\nMethods: In this randomised controlled trial, 20 patients at risk of low cardiac output following coronary artery bypass grafting and/or valve surgery were enrolled. Participants were randomly assigned to biventricular pacing (n=11) or standard care (n=9). Aortic flow was measured using an electromagnetic flowmeter within one hour post-cardiopulmonary bypass. Randomisation was conducted using a computer-generated sequence, and allocation was concealed. Blinding was not specified. The primary outcome was the change in cardiac output, measured immediately post-surgery.\n\nResults: Optimization of atrioventricular delay (171±8 msec) at an interventricular delay of 0 msec increased flow by 14% compared to the worst setting (111±11 msec, p < 0.001) and 7% compared to nominal atrioventricular delay (120 msec, p < 0.001). Interventricular delay optimization increased flow by 10% compared to the worst setting (p < 0.001) and 5% compared to nominal interventricular delay (0 msec, p < 0.001). Optimized pacing increased cardiac output by 13% compared to atrial pacing at matched heart rate (5.5±0.5 vs. 4.9±0.6 L/min; p = 0.003) and 10% compared to sinus rhythm (5.0±0.6 L/min; p = 0.019). No adverse events were reported.\n\nInterpretation: Temporary biventricular pacing with optimized delays significantly enhances intraoperative cardiac output in patients with left ventricular dysfunction. The study highlights the importance of pacing parameter optimization in improving surgical outcomes. Trial registration and funding details were not provided.",
