A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Incentive Spirometry in Bariatric Surgery Patients\n\nBackground: Patients undergoing bariatric surgery are at high risk for postoperative pulmonary complications due to obesity and foregut surgery. The effectiveness of postoperative incentive spirometry (IS) is not well-established.\n\nMethods: This randomised noninferiority clinical trial was conducted at a single-center tertiary referral teaching hospital. Eligible patients undergoing bariatric surgery from May 1, 2015, to June 30, 2016, were randomised to receive either postoperative IS (control group) or clinical observation without IS (test group). Randomisation was performed using a computer-generated sequence, and allocation was concealed. The primary outcome was the frequency of hypoxemia, defined as an arterial oxygen saturation (Sa o 2) level of less than 92% without supplementation at 6, 12, and 24 postoperative hours. Secondary outcomes included Sa o 2 levels at these times and the rate of 30-day postoperative pulmonary complications. Analysis was based on the evaluable population.\n\nResults: A total of 224 patients (50 men and 174 women; mean age, 45.6 years) were randomised, with 112 in each group. Baseline characteristics were similar between groups. No significant differences in postoperative hypoxemia were observed between the control and test groups at 6 (11.9% vs 10.4%; P = .72), 12 (5.4% vs 8.2%; P = .40), or 24 (3.7% vs 4.6%; P = .73) hours. Mean Sa o 2 levels and rates of 30-day pulmonary complications were also similar between groups. No adverse events were reported.\n\nInterpretation: Postoperative IS did not demonstrate any effect on hypoxemia, Sa o 2 levels, or pulmonary complications. Based on these findings, the routine use of IS is not recommended after bariatric surgery. Trial registration: NCT02431455. Funding: Not specified.",
