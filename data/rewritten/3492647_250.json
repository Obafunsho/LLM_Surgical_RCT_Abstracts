This study compares nonoperative treatment and hemiarthroplasty in terms of function, strength, and pain.\n\nMethods: In this randomised controlled trial, 50 patients aged 65 years and older with four-part proximal humerus fractures were randomly allocated to nonoperative treatment or hemiarthroplasty. The primary outcome was the Constant-Murley score at 12 months. Secondary outcomes included the Simple Shoulder Test, abduction strength measured by a myometer, and VAS scores for pain and disability. Randomisation was performed using a computer-generated sequence, and allocation was concealed. Outcome assessors were blinded to group allocation.\n\nResults: At 12 months, there were no significant differences between groups in Constant-Murley and Simple Shoulder Test scores. Nonoperative treatment resulted in better abduction strength at 3 and 12 months, but patients experienced more pain at 3 months, which was not evident at 12 months. No adverse events were reported in either group.\n\nInterpretation: Both nonoperative treatment and hemiarthroplasty offer similar outcomes for elderly patients with four-part proximal humerus fractures. Nonoperative treatment may provide better strength, but initial pain is higher.\n\nTrial registration: [Trial registration number]\n\nFunding: [Source of funding]",
