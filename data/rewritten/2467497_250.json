This study evaluates isolated hepatic perfusion (IHP) with melphalan in patients with isolated liver metastases from various primary tumors.\n\nMethods: This single-center trial included 19 patients with unresectable liver metastases from uveal melanoma, neuroendocrine carcinoma, gastrointestinal stromal tumors, hepatocellular carcinoma, and high-grade sarcoma. Eligibility criteria included WHO performance status 0-1 and specific blood parameters. Patients underwent a 60-min IHP with 200 mg melphalan. The primary outcome was tumor response according to RECIST criteria, measured over a median follow-up of 74 months. Randomisation and blinding were not applicable as this was a single-arm study.\n\nResults: One patient was excluded due to insufficient liver isolation. Among the 18 patients analyzed, reversible grade 3 or 4 hepatotoxicity occurred in 56%, and veno-occlusive disease in 22%. In uveal melanoma patients, 33% had a partial hepatic response, 50% had stable disease, and 17% were immediately progressive. Median disease-free survival was 6.6 months, and median overall survival was 10.0 months. Fifty percent of patients with other primary tumors showed at least partial remission, including one complete remission in a high-grade sarcoma patient.\n\nInterpretation: IHP with melphalan demonstrates activity in liver metastases from various primary tumors, but additional drugs may enhance outcomes. No trial registration or funding information was provided.",
