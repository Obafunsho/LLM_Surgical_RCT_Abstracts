A 250-word version\n\nTitle: CReST2: A Randomised Controlled Trial Comparing Covered and Uncovered Stents in Palliative Colorectal Cancer\n\nBackground: Colorectal cancer obstruction occurs in 15% of cases. Stenting is an alternative for patients unfit for surgery. This study compares covered versus uncovered stents in terms of stent patency and quality of life (QoL).\n\nMethods: This phase III multicentre RCT was conducted in 28 NHS hospitals in the UK. Participants were adults with left-sided colonic obstruction due to incurable malignancy. Randomisation was 1:1 to covered or uncovered stents, using a central service with minimization for age, WHO performance status, tumour site, and palliation indication. Blinding included patients and clinicians, except for the stent inserter. Co-primary outcomes were stent patency at 6 months and QoL at 3 months, measured by EORTC QLQ-C30.\n\nResults: From June 2017 to April 2022, 377 patients were randomised (188 covered, 189 uncovered). Stenting was unsuccessful in 47 patients. Stent patency at 6 months was 72.7% for covered and 81.9% for uncovered stents (adjusted HR 1.48, 97.5% CI 0.86–2.54). QoL scores at 3 months were 54.1 (covered) and 51.6 (uncovered) (adjusted mean difference 1.63, 97.5% CI -5.85–9.11). Complications occurred in 26.1% (covered) and 17.5% (uncovered) of patients. Stent migration was more common in the covered group.\n\nInterpretation: Uncovered stents showed greater patency and fewer complications. QoL was similar between groups.\n\nTrial registration: ISRCTN54834267.\n\nFunding: The trial was funded by the National Institute for Health Research.",
