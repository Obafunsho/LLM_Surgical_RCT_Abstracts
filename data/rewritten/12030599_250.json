A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Intravenous Magnesium in Remifentanil-Based Anesthesia\n\nBackground: Remifentanil-based anesthesia is associated with opioid-induced hyperalgesia (OIH), increasing postoperative pain and analgesic needs. This study evaluates whether intravenous magnesium, an NMDA receptor antagonist, reduces postoperative pain and analgesic requirements in adults receiving remifentanil-based anesthesia.\n\nMethods: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing intravenous magnesium to placebo. The primary outcomes were postoperative analgesic requirements and pain scores within 24 hours. Secondary outcomes included intraoperative remifentanil consumption, shivering, postoperative nausea/vomiting (PONV), extubation time, hypotension, and bradycardia. Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane RoB 2 tool, and evidence quality was evaluated with GRADE. The study was registered on PROSPERO (CRD42024609911).\n\nResults: Twenty-two RCTs with 1362 participants were included. Magnesium significantly reduced 24-hour analgesic requirements (SMD −1.51; 95% CI −2.15 to −0.87; p < 0.0001) and pain scores (SMD −0.61; 95% CI −0.90 to −0.32; p < 0.0001), with benefits lasting up to 48 hours. It also decreased intraoperative remifentanil use (SMD −0.52), shivering (OR 0.25), and PONV (OR 0.66), without prolonging extubation or increasing hypotension/bradycardia risk. High heterogeneity and potential publication bias were noted.\n\nInterpretation: Intravenous magnesium shows promise in reducing postoperative pain and analgesic needs in remifentanil-based anesthesia. However, further large-scale, methodologically robust trials are needed to confirm optimal dosing and safety profiles across diverse surgical populations.",
