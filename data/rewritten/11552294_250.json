This study aims to analyze the incidence, management, and impact of graft delamination on ecAVG patency.\n\nMethods: A retrospective cohort study was conducted at the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, China, from April 2017 to December 2021. Participants included 141 end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients requiring ecAVG for HD. The study analyzed 144 ecAVGs, comprising 124 Acuseal and 20 Flixene grafts. The primary outcome was the incidence of graft delamination, measured over a median follow-up of 24.5 months.\n\nResults: Thirteen (9.0%) ecAVGs experienced graft delamination, with an incidence of 0.04 per patient-year. The primary patency in the delamination group was significantly lower than in the non-delamination group (p < 0.05). Post-procedure primary patency was 1.3 months for PTA, 5.3 months for stenting, and 8.45 months for PGR (p = 0.029). Adverse events included thrombosis and venous hypertension.\n\nInterpretation: Graft delamination is not rare in ecAVGs and significantly reduces long-term patency. Partial graft replacement may be more effective than endovascular treatments. Further research is needed to optimize management strategies.",
