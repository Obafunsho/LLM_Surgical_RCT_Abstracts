A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial Evaluating Pleth Variability Index in Orthotopic Liver Transplantation\n\nBackground: Fluid management in orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) is complex and controversial. This study assesses the pleth variability index (PVI) as a predictor of fluid responsiveness in OLT, comparing it with other hemodynamic indices from the PiCCO 2 system.\n\nMethods: Conducted at Inonu University, Turkey, this single-center study involved 25 patients undergoing OLT. Exclusion criteria included cardiac arrhythmias, low left ventricular function, renal dysfunction, valvular heart disease, pulmonary hypertension, or fulminant hepatic failure. Patients were monitored using the Masimo pulse oximeter and PiCCO 2 system. Fluid loading (10 mL/kg colloid) was administered during the dissection and anhepatic phases. Fluid responsiveness was defined as a ≥15% increase in cardiac index (CI TPTD ). The primary outcome was the predictive value of PVI, assessed over two surgical phases.\n\nResults: In the dissection and anhepatic phases, 14 (56%) and 18 (75%) patients were classified as responders, respectively. PVI did not significantly predict fluid responsiveness, with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.56 and 0.55 for the dissection and anhepatic phases, respectively. SVV demonstrated a higher AUC, indicating superior predictive capability. No significant differences were observed in baseline PVI values between responders and nonresponders.\n\nInterpretation: PVI was not a reliable predictor of fluid responsiveness in OLT, whereas SVV was more reliable. No adverse events related to the intervention were reported. Further research is needed to explore the correlation between PVI and peripheral perfusion and the effects of catecholamine administration in OLT.\n\nTrial registration: Not provided.\n\nFunding: Not specified.",
