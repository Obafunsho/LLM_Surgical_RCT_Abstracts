A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Ultrasound Technology in Therapeutic Applications\n\nBackground: Ultrasound technology, initially used for diagnostic purposes, has expanded to therapeutic applications, including musculoskeletal pathologies and tumor treatment. This study assesses its efficacy in enhancing drug delivery and therapeutic outcomes.\n\nMethods: This randomised controlled trial was conducted in a clinical setting. Participants were eligible if they had musculoskeletal or tumor conditions. The intervention group received ultrasound therapy, while the control group received standard care. The primary outcome was the enhancement of drug delivery, measured over a 6-month period. Randomisation was computer-generated, with allocation concealment using sealed envelopes. Blinding was applied to outcome assessors, patients, and clinicians.\n\nResults: A total of 200 participants were randomised: 100 to the intervention and 100 to the control group, between January 2020 and June 2021. Analysis included 98 participants in the intervention group and 97 in the control group, using an intention-to-treat approach. The intervention group showed a significant improvement in drug delivery (mean difference = 5.2, 95% CI 3.1 to 7.3; p = 0.01). Adverse events were mild, with 3% in the intervention group and 1% in the control group experiencing side effects.\n\nInterpretation: Ultrasound therapy significantly enhances drug delivery in therapeutic applications, with minimal adverse effects. This trial supports its integration into clinical practice for improved patient outcomes. The findings suggest that ultrasound can be a valuable tool in precision medicine, offering targeted treatment with reduced systemic toxicity.\n\nTrial registration: NCT12345678\n\nFunding: This trial was funded by the National Institutes of Health.",
