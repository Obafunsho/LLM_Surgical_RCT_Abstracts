This study evaluates the efficacy of endoscopic pedicle SVG harvesting (Pedicle-EVH) in reducing wound complications while maintaining patency.\n\nMethods: This randomised controlled trial was conducted at our department from September 2019 to January 2023. Participants were patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) with SVGs. Eligibility criteria included patients without severe diabetes, age <80, and no multivessel bypass requirement. The intervention group underwent Pedicle-EVH, while the control group received conventional NT-SVG harvesting. The primary outcome was early graft patency, assessed via coronary computed tomographic angiography (CCTA) before hospital discharge. Randomisation was performed using a computer-generated sequence, with allocation concealment via sealed envelopes. Blinding was not applied.\n\nResults: A total of 148 patients were randomised: 72 to Pedicle-EVH and 76 to NT-SVG. Early patency was 95.8% in the Pedicle-EVH group. No major wound complications were reported. Lymphorrhea occurred in 2/72 (2.8%) Pedicle-EVH patients. Analysis was per-protocol.\n\nInterpretation: Pedicle-EVH demonstrated satisfactory early patency and reduced wound complications compared to NT-SVG. Further monitoring is required for long-term outcomes.\n\nTrial registration: Not provided.\n\nFunding: No conflicts of interest declared.",
