A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Educational Interventions for Vascular Access Self-Management in Haemodialysis\n\nBackground: Haemodialysis requires effective vascular access self-management to reduce complications. This study evaluates educational interventions designed to improve self-management of long-term vascular access in adults receiving haemodialysis.\n\nMethods: This systematic review included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasiexperimental studies. Participants were adults with kidney failure requiring long-term haemodialysis. Interventions involved patient education, predominantly provided by nurses, using resources like booklets and videos. The primary outcome was improvement in vascular access self-management behaviours, measured over varying timeframes. Randomisation methods and allocation concealment were not consistently reported. Blinding details were not specified.\n\nResults: Seven studies with 540 participants were included: two RCTs and five quasiexperimental. Education significantly improved self-management behaviours. However, there was inconsistency in outcome measures and insufficient evidence on the optimal delivery and duration of interventions. No adverse events were reported.\n\nInterpretation: Educational interventions improved self-management behaviours in adults with long-term haemodialysis vascular access. Further research is needed to establish evidence-based, nurse-led interventions. Trial registration: PROSPERO CRD42023414193. Funding: Not specified.",
