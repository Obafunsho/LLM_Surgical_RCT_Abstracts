A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Adjuvant Treatment Strategies Following Neoadjuvant Chemoimmunotherapy in Resectable NSCLC\n\nBackground: This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of adjuvant treatment strategies following neoadjuvant chemoimmunotherapy (NCIT) in patients with resectable non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).\n\nMethods: A retrospective analysis was conducted on 317 patients with stage IB-IIIB NSCLC treated at Shandong Cancer Hospital from January 2019 to February 2024. Patients were categorized into no-treatment (n=46), chemotherapy (ChT) (n=38), immunotherapy (IT) (n=33), chemoimmunotherapy (ChIT) (n=168), and upfront surgery with adjuvant immunotherapy (US+AIT) (n=32) groups. Event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) were primary outcomes, assessed over a median follow-up of 30.7 months. Propensity score matching (PSM) was used to balance baseline differences.\n\nResults: IT and ChIT groups demonstrated improved EFS compared to the no-treatment group. After PSM, EFS was significantly prolonged with IT and ChIT in patients who did not achieve a pathological complete response (pCR). No EFS or OS benefit was observed in patients achieving pCR. Among patients with PD-L1 expression ≥1%, EFS was significantly improved with IT and ChIT compared to no-treatment and US+AIT groups. The study found similar EFS benefits for IT and ChIT across stage IB-IIB and IIIA-IIIB subgroups. No significant adverse events were reported.\n\nInterpretation: Adjuvant IT or ChIT may benefit patients with resectable NSCLC receiving NCIT, particularly those without pCR and with positive PD-L1 expression. These findings contribute to the ongoing discussion on optimal postoperative adjuvant strategies in the perioperative management of NSCLC. Trial registration: Not applicable.
