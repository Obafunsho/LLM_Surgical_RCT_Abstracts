A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of PlasmaJet in Cytoreductive Surgery for Advanced Ovarian Cancer\n\nBackground: This study evaluated whether the adjuvant use of a neutral argon plasma device (PlasmaJet) improves the rate of complete cytoreductive surgery (CRS) in advanced-stage ovarian cancer.\n\nMethods: In this multicenter, single-blinded, randomised controlled trial, 327 patients with FIGO stage IIIB–IV epithelial ovarian cancer were randomised to undergo primary or interval CRS with (intervention) or without (control) PlasmaJet. The primary outcome was the rate of complete CRS, measured immediately post-surgery. Secondary outcomes included duration of surgery, blood loss, bowel resections, colostomies, hospitalization, 30-day morbidity, and quality of life (QoL). Randomisation was performed using block randomisation with stratification, and patients were blinded to group allocation.\n\nResults: From February 2018 to September 2020, 190 patients were randomised to the intervention group and 193 to the control group. Complete CRS was achieved in 75.8% of the intervention group and 67.6% of the control group (risk difference 8.2%, 95% CI –0.021 to 0.181; P = 0.131). Per-protocol analysis showed 85.6% in the intervention group versus 71.5% in the control group (risk difference 14.1%, 95% CI 0.042 to 0.235; P = 0.005). QoL at 6 months post-surgery was higher in the intervention group (95% CI 0.455–8.350; P = 0.029). No significant differences in adverse events were observed.\n\nTrial Registration: NL62035.078.17.\n\nFunding: ZonMw.",
