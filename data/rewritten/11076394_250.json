The primary endpoint was overall survival (OS). Randomization was performed using an interactive web response system with permuted blocks, stratified by ECOG performance status and resectability. The trial was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02172976).\n\nResults: Recruitment was stopped after 40 patients were randomized (arm A: 21, arm B: 19) due to poor accrual. In the intention-to-treat population, median OS was 25.68 months in arm A and 10.03 months in arm B. Median RFS/PFS was 9.8 months in arm A and 6.64 months in arm B. Perioperative morbidity was 72% in arm A and 46% in arm B. Adverse events grade ≥3 were higher in arm B (84% vs. 57%). \n\nInterpretation: Although limited by small sample size, perioperative FOLFIRINOX showed no increased surgical complications but did not improve OS compared to adjuvant gemcitabine. Patient selection for neoadjuvant therapy is critical. The trial was funded by institutional sources.",
