Mechanical valves require lifelong anticoagulation, increasing complication risks. This trial assesses a novel tri-leaflet mechanical valve designed to minimize thrombogenicity without long-term anticoagulation.\n\nMethods: This randomised controlled trial was conducted at the University of Minnesota. Participants were adults with severe aortic stenosis eligible for valve replacement. The intervention group received the TRIFLO Heart Valve, while the control group received the On-X valve. The primary outcome was the incidence of major bleeding events at 12 months. Randomisation was computer-generated, with allocation concealment via sealed envelopes. Outcome assessors were blinded to group allocation.\n\nResults: A total of 8 participants were randomised: 6 to the TRIFLO group and 2 to the control group. All participants were analysed per protocol. The TRIFLO group showed no major bleeding events, while the control group also reported none. The TRIFLO valve demonstrated favorable hemodynamics, with no thrombus formation or adverse events. Pathology studies revealed no thrombus or pannus in the TRIFLO group, and normal host reaction was observed.\n\nInterpretation: The TRIFLO Heart Valve shows potential in reducing the need for long-term anticoagulation, with no major bleeding events observed. The valve's design may offer improved hemodynamics and durability. Further studies with larger sample sizes are necessary to validate these findings and assess long-term outcomes.\n\nTrial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT05687448\n\nFunding: The study was funded by Novostia, Switzerland.",
