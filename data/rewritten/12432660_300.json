A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial on Post-Operative Radiotherapy in Resected NSCLC\n\nBackground: The efficacy of post-operative radiotherapy (PORT) in radically resected non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), especially in pN2 disease, is uncertain. This trial assesses the impact of PORT on disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS).\n\nMethods: This multicenter randomised controlled trial included patients with resected NSCLC. Participants were randomly assigned to receive either PORT using modern techniques or no PORT. The primary outcome was DFS over a 5-year period. Randomisation was computer-generated, and allocation was concealed. Blinding was not applied to patients or clinicians, but outcome assessors were blinded.\n\nResults: A total of 501 patients were randomised, with 250 in the PORT group and 251 in the control group, recruited between 2010 and 2021. In the intention-to-treat analysis, PORT significantly reduced mediastinal recurrence (HR 0.71, 95% CI: 0.51–0.97) but did not improve DFS or OS (HR 1.02, 95% CI: 0.68–1.52). Adverse events were more frequent in the PORT group, with grade 3 or 4 cardiopulmonary toxicities in 11% compared to 5% in the control group. No grade 4 or 5 radiotherapy-related adverse events were reported, and only 1 patient experienced grade 3 radiation pneumonitis.\n\nInterpretation: While PORT reduces mediastinal recurrence, it does not enhance DFS or OS and increases cardiopulmonary toxicity. The integration of advanced radiation techniques and systemic therapies in future trials is crucial to optimize patient outcomes. Tailored clinical trials are needed to balance the risks of mediastinal relapse, systemic progression, and treatment-related toxicities.\n\nTrial registration: NCTXXXXXXX\n\nFunding: Supported by [Funding Source].",
