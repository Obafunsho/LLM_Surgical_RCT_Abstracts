A 300-word version\n\nTitle: High-Sensitivity Cardiac Troponin T in Detecting Perioperative Myocardial Infarction: A Randomised Controlled Trial\n\nBackground: This study assessed the utility of a high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T (hscTnT) assay versus contemporary cardiac troponin I (cTnI) in identifying perioperative myocardial infarction (MI) following non-cardiac surgery.\n\nMethods: Conducted as an ancillary study within the Vitamins in Nitrous Oxide trial, the research involved 605 patients who had baseline and at least one postoperative hscTnT measurement. The primary outcome was the incidence of myocardial injury and MI, evaluated using various hscTnT change metrics. The study setting was a surgical environment. Randomisation and allocation concealment methods were not detailed. Blinding of outcome assessors, patients, and clinicians was not specified.\n\nResults: Of the 605 patients, 70 (12%) exhibited ECG changes indicative of myocardial ischemia. Using contemporary cTnI, 82 patients (14%) were diagnosed with myocardial injury, with 31 (5.1%) confirmed as MI. The hscTnT assay identified 67 patients (11%) with MI, representing a twofold increase in detection. Incidence rates of myocardial injury ranged from 12% to 65% depending on the hscTnT metric. New postoperative hscTnT elevation correlated with a 5-fold increase in 6-month mortality. Adverse events were not reported.\n\nInterpretation: The hscTnT assay enhances the detection rate of perioperative MI compared to cTnI. However, the use of different hscTnT metrics can result in under- or over-diagnosis. The study highlights the need for standardised metrics in clinical practice.
