The primary outcome was a composite treatment response at 24 months, defined as a clinically important improvement in pain and absence of radiologic progression. Randomisation was stratified by ARCO stage, and allocation was concealed. Blinding included patients, clinicians, and outcome assessors. Sixty-eight patients were randomised between December 2011 and February 2019, with 25 in the study group and 29 in the control group analysed using an intention-to-treat approach.\n\nResults: At 24 months, there was no significant difference in composite treatment response between the study (61%) and control groups (69%; p = 0.54). Adverse events were rare and mild, with no serious events related to treatment. The trial was registered under ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01529008.\n\nInterpretation: The addition of autologous osteoblastic cells to core decompression did not improve outcomes in early-stage ONFH. Further research is needed to explore alternative biological treatments. The study was funded by Bone Therapeutics SA.",
