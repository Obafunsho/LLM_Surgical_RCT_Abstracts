While current approved drugs are limited to hereditary angioedema (HAE), there is growing interest in developing new drug candidates for additional indications.\n\nMethods: This study conducted a two-stage literature search from March to December 2023 to identify drug candidates targeting the KKS. The search included PubMed, Clinicaltrials.gov, and Google Scholar. Identified drugs were categorized by target, development stage, and intended indication.\n\nResults: A total of 68 drugs were identified: 10 approved, 25 in clinical development, and 33 in preclinical development. The most studied indications were diabetic retinopathy, thromboprophylaxis, and HAE. Notably, ixodes ricinus-contact phase inhibitor is in phase 2 for thromboprophylaxis, and RZ402 and THR-149 are in phase 2 for diabetic macular edema. The primary outcome was the identification of promising drug candidates for emerging indications.\n\nInterpretation: The therapeutic potential of targeting the KKS extends beyond HAE, with ongoing research indicating potential benefits for other diseases. This study highlights the expanding scope of therapeutic interventions targeting the KKS, offering future treatment options for patients.\n\nTrial registration: Not applicable.\n\nFunding: Not specified.",
