A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Preoperative Internal Carotid Artery Stenting in Lateral Skull Base Paraganglioma Surgery\n\nBackground: This study assesses the role of preoperative internal carotid artery (ICA) stenting in improving surgical outcomes for lateral skull base paragangliomas.\n\nMethods: Conducted as a monocentric retrospective study, 26 patients with head and neck paragangliomas (19 tympanojugular, 4 carotid body, 3 vagal) underwent ICA stenting between 2008 and 2023. Eligibility criteria included histologically confirmed paraganglioma, extensive vascular involvement, and ICA stenting followed by surgery. The primary outcome was the extent of tumor resection, assessed intraoperatively. Due to the retrospective nature, randomisation and blinding were not applicable.\n\nResults: The stent complication rate was 3.1%. Self-expanding nitinol stents enabled complete ICA mobilization and vascular dissection in all cases. Gross total tumor resection was achieved in 85% of patients. The median follow-up was 7.83 years, with no local recurrence observed. Adverse events included one case of thalamus infarction, which resolved without permanent sequelae. The procedure allowed for safe tumor dissection from the ICA, enhancing surgical radicality and safety.\n\nInterpretation: Preoperative ICA stenting is a viable strategy to improve surgical outcomes in paraganglioma cases with significant vascular involvement. The procedure's limitations include procedural complications, temporary antiplatelet therapy, and surgical delay. Despite these, the stenting approach offers a significant advantage in preserving ICA integrity and facilitating radical tumor resection.\n\nTrial registration: Not applicable.\n\nFunding: Not specified.",
