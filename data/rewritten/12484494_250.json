A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Opioid-Sparing Analgesia in Postoperative Pain Management\n\nBackground: Opioid-sparing analgesia aims to reduce opioid consumption and associated adverse effects in postoperative pain management. This systematic review and meta-analysis evaluates its impact on postoperative outcomes.\n\nMethods: We conducted a comprehensive search of PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library for randomised controlled trials involving adult surgical patients up to July 10, 2024. The primary outcome was total morphine consumption within 24 hours postoperatively. Secondary outcomes included postoperative pain scores, patient satisfaction, length of stay, quality of recovery, and opioid-related adverse effects. Randomisation and allocation concealment methods were assessed, with blinding of participants and outcome assessors.\n\nResults: Fifty-eight studies with 5614 patients were included. Opioid-sparing analgesia reduced total morphine consumption (mean difference [MD] = -9.47 mg, 95% confidence interval [CI] -13.00 to -5.95) and postoperative pain scores (MD = -0.72, 95% CI -0.97 to -0.47). Patient satisfaction was higher (MD = 0.88, 95% CI 0.36 to 1.40). No significant differences were observed in length of stay or recovery quality. The incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) was lower (odds ratio [OR] = 0.73, 95% CI 0.59 to 0.90), as was pruritus (OR = 0.64, 95% CI 0.41 to 0.98).\n\nInterpretation: Opioid-sparing analgesia is associated with reduced morphine consumption, lower pain scores, and decreased PONV and pruritus, improving patient satisfaction.
