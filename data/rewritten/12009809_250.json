A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial on Hypertension Management in Aortic Coarctation Patients\n\nBackground: Aortic coarctation (AoC) is a congenital heart defect affecting 5%–8% of patients with structural anomalies. Despite surgical and percutaneous interventions, hypertension remains a significant complication, developing in 20%–70% of patients.\n\nMethods: This randomised controlled trial was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of different antihypertensive strategies in AoC patients. Participants were recruited from a tertiary care center, with eligibility criteria including a confirmed diagnosis of AoC and post-repair hypertension. Randomisation was performed using a computer-generated sequence, with allocation concealment ensured by sealed envelopes. Blinding was applied to outcome assessors.\n\nIntervention: Participants were randomised to receive either beta-blockers, ACE inhibitors, ARBs, or CCBs. The primary outcome was the reduction in systolic blood pressure over a 12-month period.\n\nResults: A total of 200 participants were randomised: 50 to each treatment group. Analysis was conducted on 196 participants using an intention-to-treat approach. The mean reduction in systolic blood pressure was greatest in the ACE inhibitor group (mean difference = 5.2 mm Hg, 95% CI 3.1 to 7.3; p = 0.01). Adverse events were reported in 3% of the ACE inhibitor group and 1% of the beta-blocker group, with mild gastrointestinal side-effects.\n\nInterpretation: ACE inhibitors were most effective in reducing systolic blood pressure in AoC patients. The trial was registered under number NCT12345678 and funded by the National Heart Institute.",
