The primary outcomes were the success rate of blind ETI and intubation time. Secondary outcomes included first-attempt intubation success rate and perceived ease of use. Searches were performed in Embase, MEDLINE (PubMed), Scopus, and LILACS. Randomisation methods and allocation concealment were assessed, but blinding was not reported.\n\nResults: A total of 27 RCTs met the inclusion criteria. The Fastrach Intubating Laryngeal Mask Airway (LMA Fastrach), i-gel, Air-Q, and S.A.L.T. were the most used SGDs. LMA Fastrach and i-gel showed the shortest intubation times. SGDs with the highest overall success rates were i-gel, S.A.L.T., LMA Fastrach, and single-use LMA Fastrach, achieving success rates greater than 90%. AuraGain had the lowest first-attempt and overall success rates.\n\nInterpretation: New SGDs have not surpassed the LMA Fastrach for blind ETI. The single-use LMA Fastrach may be a suitable replacement for the reusable version. I-gel is a viable alternative, while AuraGain is not recommended. No adverse events were reported. The study was not registered, and funding sources were not disclosed.",
