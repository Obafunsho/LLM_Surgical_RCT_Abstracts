A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of PlasmaJet in Cytoreductive Surgery for Advanced Ovarian Cancer\n\nBackground: This study aimed to determine if the adjuvant use of a neutral argon plasma device (PlasmaJet) enhances the rate of complete cytoreductive surgery (CRS) in patients with advanced-stage ovarian cancer.\n\nMethods: Conducted as a multicenter, single-blinded, randomised controlled trial, 327 patients with FIGO stage IIIB–IV epithelial ovarian cancer were randomised to undergo primary or interval CRS with (intervention) or without (control) PlasmaJet. The primary outcome was the rate of complete CRS, assessed immediately post-surgery. Secondary outcomes included duration of surgery, blood loss, bowel resections, colostomies, hospitalization, 30-day morbidity, and quality of life (QoL). Randomisation was executed using block randomisation with stratification, and patients were blinded to their group allocation.\n\nResults: Between February 2018 and September 2020, 190 patients were randomised to the intervention group and 193 to the control group. Complete CRS was achieved in 75.8% of the intervention group compared to 67.6% of the control group (risk difference 8.2%, 95% CI –0.021 to 0.181; P = 0.131). Per-protocol analysis excluding patients with unresectable disease showed 85.6% in the intervention group versus 71.5% in the control group (risk difference 14.1%, 95% CI 0.042 to 0.235; P = 0.005). Patient-reported QoL at 6 months post-surgery was significantly better in the intervention group (95% CI 0.455–8.350; P = 0.029). Adverse events were similar between groups, with no significant differences observed.\n\nInterpretation: The adjuvant use of PlasmaJet during CRS for advanced-stage ovarian cancer significantly increased the rate of complete CRS and improved QoL at 6 months post-surgery.\n\nTrial Registration: NL62035.078.17.\n\nFunding: ZonMw.",
