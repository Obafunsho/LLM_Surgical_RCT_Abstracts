A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of a Nomogram Model for Predicting Postoperative Delirium in Esophageal Cancer Patients\n\nBackground: Postoperative delirium (POD) is a common complication following esophagectomy for esophageal cancer, impacting recovery and increasing healthcare costs. This study aimed to develop a nomogram model to predict POD risk.\n\nMethods: This randomised controlled trial included 396 patients undergoing esophagectomy for esophageal cancer. Participants were randomly assigned to a training set (n=278) and a testing set (n=118). The primary outcome was the incidence of POD within 14 days post-surgery. LASSO regression identified predictors, and a nomogram was constructed. The model's performance was evaluated using ROC curves, calibration curves, and decision curve analysis.\n\nResults: The incidence of POD was 35.4%. The nomogram included six predictors: postoperative pain, infections, dexmedetomidine use, propofol use, mechanical ventilation duration, and PNI. The model demonstrated good discrimination with an AUC of 0.919 in the training set and 0.871 in the testing set. Calibration and decision curves indicated good agreement and clinical utility. No adverse events related to the intervention were reported.\n\nInterpretation: The nomogram accurately predicts POD risk in esophageal cancer patients post-surgery, offering a valuable tool for clinicians to identify high-risk individuals and implement preventive measures.\n\nTrial registration: Not provided.\n\nFunding: Not specified.",
