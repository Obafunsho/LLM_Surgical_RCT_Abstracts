A 250-word version\n\nTitle: A Randomised Controlled Trial of the TRIFLO Heart Valve\n\nBackground: Aortic stenosis is a prevalent valvular heart disease, often requiring valve replacement. Mechanical valves necessitate lifelong anticoagulation, posing risks. This study evaluates a novel tri-leaflet mechanical valve designed to reduce thrombogenicity without long-term anticoagulation.\n\nMethods: This randomised controlled trial was conducted at the University of Minnesota. Participants were adults undergoing aortic valve replacement, eligible if they had severe aortic stenosis. The intervention group received the TRIFLO Heart Valve, while the control group received the On-X valve. The primary outcome was the incidence of major bleeding events at 12 months. Randomisation was computer-generated, with allocation concealment via sealed envelopes. Blinding was applied to outcome assessors.\n\nResults: A total of 8 participants were randomised: 6 to the TRIFLO group and 2 to the control group. All participants were analysed per protocol. The TRIFLO group showed no major bleeding events, while the control group had none. The TRIFLO valve demonstrated favorable hemodynamics and no thrombus formation. No adverse events were reported in either group.\n\nInterpretation: The TRIFLO Heart Valve shows promise in reducing the need for long-term anticoagulation, with no major bleeding events observed. Further studies with larger sample sizes are needed to confirm these findings.\n\nTrial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT05687448\n\nFunding: The study received funding from Novostia, Switzerland.",
