A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Surgical Ventricular Reconstruction in Coronary Artery Disease\n\nBackground: The Surgical Treatment for Ischemic Heart Failure (STICH) trial aimed to determine if surgical ventricular reconstruction (SVR) plus coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) offers a mortality benefit over CABG alone in patients with coronary artery disease and left ventricular dysfunction.\n\nMethods: This randomised controlled trial involved 1,000 patients, with 267 undergoing myocardial viability assessment via single photon computed tomography. Participants were randomised to receive either CABG alone or CABG plus SVR. The primary outcome was mortality or cardiac hospitalization over a 3-year follow-up. Randomisation was centrally managed, with allocation concealment. Blinding details were not specified.\n\nResults: At 3 years, no significant difference was observed in mortality or the combined outcome of death or cardiac hospitalization between patients with and without myocardial viability. There was no significant interaction between the type of surgery and global viability status. Furthermore, no differences were found in outcomes based on the presence of anterior wall or apical scar. The analysis was performed using an intention-to-treat approach. Adverse events were not reported.\n\nInterpretation: In patients with coronary artery disease and severe regional left ventricular dysfunction, myocardial viability assessment does not identify those who would benefit from adding SVR to CABG in terms of mortality or cardiac hospitalization. The study suggests that SVR may not provide additional benefit over CABG alone. Trial registration and funding information were not disclosed.",
