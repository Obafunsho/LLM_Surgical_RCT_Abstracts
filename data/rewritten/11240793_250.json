A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Preoperative Internal Carotid Artery Stenting in Lateral Skull Base Paraganglioma Surgery\n\nBackground: This study evaluates the efficacy of preoperative internal carotid artery (ICA) stenting in enhancing surgical outcomes for lateral skull base paragangliomas.\n\nMethods: A monocentric retrospective study was conducted on 26 patients with head and neck paragangliomas (19 tympanojugular, 4 carotid body, 3 vagal) treated with ICA stents between 2008 and 2023. Eligibility criteria included histologically confirmed paraganglioma, extensive vascular involvement, and ICA stenting followed by surgery. The primary outcome was the extent of tumor resection, measured intraoperatively. Randomisation and blinding were not applicable due to the retrospective design.\n\nResults: The stent complication rate was 3.1%. Self-expanding nitinol stents facilitated complete ICA mobilization and vascular dissection in all cases. Gross total tumor resection was achieved in 85% of patients. The median follow-up was 7.83 years, with no local recurrence observed. Adverse events included one case of thalamus infarction, which resolved without permanent sequelae.\n\nInterpretation: Preoperative ICA stenting is a viable strategy to enhance surgical radicality and safety in paraganglioma cases with significant vascular involvement. The procedure's limitations include procedural complications, temporary antiplatelet therapy, and surgical delay.\n\nTrial registration: Not applicable.\n\nFunding: Not specified.",
