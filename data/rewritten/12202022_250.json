This study evaluates its efficacy as a primary treatment.\n\nMethods: This retrospective analysis was conducted at S.M.S. Medical College and Group of Hospitals, Jaipur, on 90 patients with severe aortoiliac occlusive disease from August 2012 to August 2022. Eligibility criteria included complete abdominal aorta obstruction at the renal artery level with no suitable site for aorta clamping. The intervention involved thoracobifemoral bypass using BARD IMPRA expanded polytetrafluoroethylene vascular grafts. The primary outcome was 30-day graft patency.\n\nResults: Of the 90 patients (83 males, 7 females; ages 51-77), the 30-day mortality rate was 3.33% (3 patients). Graft patency was 100% at 30 days. Major morbidities included graft occlusion in one patient, managed by embolectomy, and ascites in another, addressed conservatively. No randomisation or blinding was employed.\n\nInterpretation: Thoracofemoral bypass as a primary intervention for juxtarenal aortoiliac occlusive disease demonstrates favorable short-term outcomes with reliable patency and acceptable safety. The study was not registered as a trial and was funded by institutional resources.",
