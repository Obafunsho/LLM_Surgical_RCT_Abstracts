A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of MRI and Intraoperative Electrophysiological Recording in Targeting the Subthalamic Nucleus for Parkinson's Disease\n\nBackground: Precise targeting of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) is vital for the success of deep brain stimulation in Parkinson's disease. This study investigates the efficacy of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and intraoperative electrophysiological recording in enhancing electrode placement accuracy.\n\nMethods: This randomised controlled trial involved 27 Parkinson's disease patients from a single surgical center, meeting eligibility criteria for STN targeting. A total of 54 electrodes were implanted. Target planning utilised MRI visualisation and coordinate guidelines relative to the AC–PC line. Intraoperative microelectrode recording refined electrode positions, with postoperative MRI confirming placement accuracy in 16 cases.\n\nResults: Initial MRI-based targeting averaged 11.5 mm lateral, 2.5 mm posterior, and 4.1 mm inferior to the AC–PC line. Electrophysiological adjustments refined the target to 11.7 mm lateral, 2.1 mm posterior, and 3.8 mm inferior. The mean placement error was 0.48 mm, 0.69 mm, and 2.9 mm in the x, y, and z axes, respectively. No postoperative MRI-related complications were reported.\n\nInterpretation: The combination of MRI and intraoperative electrophysiological recording is crucial for precise STN targeting. Individual variations in STN location require customised approaches. The stereotactic method used demonstrated high accuracy in electrode placement.\n\nTrial registration: Not provided.\n\nFunding: Not provided.",
