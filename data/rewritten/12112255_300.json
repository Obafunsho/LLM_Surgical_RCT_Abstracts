  "abstract": "Title: A Randomised Controlled Trial of the Alfalfa App for Warfarin Management in Post-Cardiac Valve Replacement Patients\n\nBackground: Anticoagulation management is crucial for patients undergoing cardiac valve replacement. This study evaluates the efficacy, safety, and cost-effectiveness of the Alfalfa app for warfarin management compared to offline methods.\n\nMethods: This single-center, randomised controlled trial (ChiCTR1900021920) was conducted at Fuwai Yunnan Cardiovascular Hospital. Participants were eligible if they had been on warfarin for at least 3 months, received warfarin management through the Alfalfa app or pharmacist-led clinic visits, and had no serious bleeding or thrombotic events in the prior 3 months. Participants were randomised 1:1 using a Microsoft Excel-generated list. The study was open-label. The primary outcome was the time in therapeutic range (TTR) over 3 months.\n\nResults: A total of 405 participants were analysed (204 in the Alfalfa group, 201 in the offline group). The Alfalfa group had a higher TTR (66.46% vs 46.65%, P <.001) and monitoring frequency (8.14 vs 4.47, P <.001). Minor bleeding was more frequent in the Alfalfa group (5.9% vs 1.5%, P =.02). The Alfalfa group had lower average costs per test (42.37 vs 78.3, P <.001) and a lower cost-effectiveness ratio (385.9 vs 662.9).\n\nInterpretation: The Alfalfa app improves warfarin management efficiency and cost-effectiveness without increasing major adverse events. Trial registration: ChiCTR1900021920. Funding: Not specified.\n\n---\n\nTitle: A Randomised Controlled Trial of the Alfalfa App for Warfarin Management in Post-Cardiac Valve Replacement Patients\n\nBackground: Effective anticoagulation management is vital for patients post-cardiac valve replacement. This trial assesses the Alfalfa app's efficacy, safety, and cost-effectiveness compared to traditional offline management.\n\nMethods: Conducted at Fuwai Yunnan Cardiovascular Hospital, this single-center, randomised controlled trial (ChiCTR1900021920) included patients on warfarin for at least 3 months, managed via the Alfalfa app or pharmacist-led clinic visits, with no serious bleeding or thrombotic events in the prior 3 months. Participants were randomised 1:1 using a Microsoft Excel-generated list. The study was open-label. The primary outcome was the time in therapeutic range (TTR) over 3 months.\n\nResults: Of 405 participants analysed (204 Alfalfa, 201 offline), the Alfalfa group showed a higher TTR (66.46% vs 46.65%, P <.001) and monitoring frequency (8.14 vs 4.47, P <.001). The Alfalfa group had lower subtherapeutic INR values (14.16% vs 16.91%, P <.05) and extreme subtherapeutic values (16.45% vs 20.69%, P <.05). Minor bleeding was more frequent in the Alfalfa group (5.9% vs 1.5%, P =.02). The Alfalfa group had lower average costs per test (42.37 vs 78.3, P <.001) and a lower cost-effectiveness ratio (385.9 vs 662.9).\n\nInterpretation: The Alfalfa app enhances warfarin management efficiency and cost-effectiveness without increasing major adverse events.
