A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Intraoperative Blood Salvage in Liver Resection: A Randomised Controlled Trial\n\nBackground: This randomised controlled trial aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of intraoperative blood salvage in reducing blood loss during liver resection. Despite the known benefits of reducing central venous pressure (CVP) to decrease blood loss, a consistently effective method has not been established.\n\nMethods: Living liver donors scheduled for liver graft procurement were randomly assigned to either a blood salvage group or a control group. The blood salvage group had a blood volume equal to approximately 0.7% of the patient's body weight collected before liver transection. The primary outcome was blood loss during liver parenchymal division. Randomisation was performed intraoperatively, and surgeons were blinded to group allocation.\n\nResults: Seventy-nine donors were randomised: 40 to the blood salvage group and 39 to the control group. Blood loss during liver transection was significantly lower in the blood salvage group (median 140 mL) compared to the control group (median 230 mL, P = 0.034). CVP at the beginning of liver parenchymal division was also significantly lower in the blood salvage group (median 5 cm H2O) than in the control group (median 6 cm H2O, P = 0.005). Multivariate analysis showed that intraoperative blood salvage reduced blood loss (adjusted OR 0.31; 95% CI 0.11–0.85, P = 0.025).\n\nInterpretation: Intraoperative blood salvage significantly reduces blood loss during hepatic parenchymal transection. No adverse events were reported. Trial registration and funding details are not provided.",
