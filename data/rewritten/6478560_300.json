A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Neurobehavioral Outcomes in Pediatric Open-Chest CPR: A Randomised Controlled Trial\n\nBackground: There is limited information on neurobehavioral outcomes in children following open-chest cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). This study aimed to assess neurobehavioral outcomes one year post-arrest in children who received open-chest CPR during in-hospital cardiac arrest and explore factors associated with survival and favorable neurobehavioral outcomes.\n\nMethods: This secondary analysis of the Therapeutic Hypothermia after Pediatric Cardiac Arrest In-Hospital Trial included 56 children who underwent open-chest CPR. Neurobehavioral status was evaluated using the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales, Second Edition (VABS-II) at pre-arrest baseline and 12 months post-arrest. The primary outcome was 12-month survival with VABS-II ≥70. Randomisation and allocation concealment methods were not applicable. Blinding details were not specified.\n\nResults: Among the 56 children, 49 (88%) had undergone cardiac surgery, and 43 (77%) were under 1 year old. Forty-four (79%) were cannulated for ECMO during CPR or within 6 hours of return of spontaneous circulation. Thirty-three (59%) survived to 12 months, and 22 (41%) survived with VABS-II decreased by ≤15 points from baseline. Of those with baseline VABS-II ≥70, 23 (51%) survived with VABS-II ≥70. Multivariable analyses indicated that ECMO use, renal replacement therapy, and higher maximum international normalized ratio were independently associated with lower 12-month survival with VABS-II ≥70.\n\nInterpretation: Approximately half of the children survived with good neurobehavioral outcomes one year after open-chest CPR. The use of ECMO and post-arrest renal or hepatic dysfunction may be linked to poorer neurobehavioral outcomes. Trial registration and funding information were not provided. Further research is needed to understand the impact of these factors on long-term outcomes in this population.",
