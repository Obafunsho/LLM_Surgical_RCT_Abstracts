A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Cold-Stored vs. Room Temperature Platelet Transfusion in Traumatic Brain Injury\n\nBackground: This study aimed to evaluate the feasibility, efficacy, and safety of cold-stored platelet (CSP) transfusion compared to room temperature (RT) platelet transfusion in patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI).\n\nMethods: A phase 2, single-center, open-label randomized controlled trial was conducted at UPMC Presbyterian, a level 1 trauma center. Eligible participants were TBI patients requiring platelet transfusion. Participants were randomized 1:1 to receive either CSP or RT platelets. The primary outcome was feasibility, and the principal clinical outcome was the 6-month Glasgow Outcome Scale–extended (GOS-E) score. Randomization was performed using a permuted block design, and allocation was concealed from outcome assessors.\n\nResults: From March 17, 2022, to October 18, 2023, 100 patients were randomized (50 to CSP and 50 to RT). The 6-month GOS-E scores did not differ significantly between groups (OR: 1.58, 95% CI: 0.71 to 3.54, P = 0.27). CSP transfusion was associated with a lower rate of neurosurgical intervention (difference: -14.4%, 95% CI: -26.5% to -2.3%, P = 0.03). Adverse event rates were similar across groups. No outcome differences were associated with the storage age of CSPs.\n\nInterpretation: CSP transfusion in TBI patients is feasible and associated with a reduced need for neurosurgical intervention without increased adverse events. Further phase 3 trials are needed to confirm these findings.\n\nTrial registration: IND 025180.\n\nFunding: Supported by the U.S. Department of Defense and the University of Pittsburgh.",
