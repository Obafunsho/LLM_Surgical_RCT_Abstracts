This study assesses the effectiveness of the Cox-Maze IV procedure combined with left atrial appendage (LAA) occlusion in treating AF.\n\nMethods: Conducted in Brazil, this randomised controlled trial included patients with symptomatic AF unresponsive to antiarrhythmic drugs or catheter ablation. Participants were randomised to undergo the Cox-Maze IV procedure with LAA occlusion or receive standard medical therapy. The primary outcome was freedom from AF at 12 months. Randomisation was computer-generated, with allocation concealment. Outcome assessors were blinded.\n\nResults: A total of 200 participants were randomised: 100 to the intervention group and 100 to the control group, between January 2020 and June 2021. In the intervention group, 98 participants were analysed using an intention-to-treat approach, while 97 were analysed in the control group. The intervention group achieved a 92% AF freedom rate at 12 months, significantly higher than the 0% in the control group (p < 0.001). Adverse events in the intervention group included renal dysfunction and pacemaker requirement in <5% of patients, with no increase in overall mortality. The study demonstrated the superiority of the Cox-Maze IV procedure in reducing AF recurrence and associated complications.\n\nInterpretation: The Cox-Maze IV procedure with LAA occlusion offers significant benefits in managing AF compared to standard therapy, with a favorable safety profile. These findings support its use in patients with refractory AF. Trial registration: NCT12345678. Funding: Supported by Brazilian Ministry of Health.",
