A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of NeuroPort™ Microelectrode Array in Epilepsy Monitoring\n\nBackground: Detailed investigations of cortical physiology require submillimeter-scale recording of brain electrical activity. Standard intracranial electrodes average potentials from large neuron populations, whereas microelectrode arrays (MEA) allow for local field potentials (LFPs) and single-unit activity recording.\n\nMethods: This randomised controlled trial involved seven patients undergoing subdural electrode implantation for epilepsy monitoring. Participants were eligible if they required epilepsy monitoring and were implanted with the NeuroPort™ MEA in putative non-eloquent epileptogenic cortex. The primary outcome was the successful recording of LFPs and single-unit activity over 3–28 days. Randomisation and allocation concealment methods were not specified. Blinding was not applicable.\n\nResults: All patients achieved successful MEA implantation with minor operative difficulties. Robust and durable LFPs and single-unit recordings were obtained from all individuals. Histological analysis showed no significant tissue injury or inflammatory response. No neurological complications or infections were associated with electrode implantation or monitoring. Two patients developed post-resection wound healing issues, with one requiring operative revision.\n\nInterpretation: Semi-chronic micro-EEG recording using the NeuroPort™ microarray is safe and effective. Although significant tissue injury, infection, or CSF leak were not encountered, the connection pedestal's large profile resulted in suboptimal wound closure and healing in some patients. This issue is expected to be addressed in future device iterations.\n\nTrial registration: Not provided.\n\nFunding: Not specified.",
