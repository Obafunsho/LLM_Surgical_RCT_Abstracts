Dexmedetomidine sedation in critical care units has been linked to reduced delirium, but its intraoperative use remains underexplored.\n\nMethods: This multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial involved elderly patients (>68 years) undergoing major elective noncardiac surgery. Participants were randomized to receive either dexmedetomidine (0.5 µg/kg/h) or saline placebo during surgery and for 2 hours postoperatively. The primary outcome was postoperative delirium, assessed daily. Secondary outcomes included postoperative cognitive decline. Randomization was computer-generated, with allocation concealed using sealed envelopes. Blinding included patients, clinicians, and outcome assessors. Recruitment occurred from February 2008 to May 2014.\n\nResults: A total of 404 patients were randomized (202 to dexmedetomidine, 202 to placebo); 390 completed delirium assessments. Postoperative delirium incidence was similar between groups (12.2% dexmedetomidine vs 11.4% placebo, P = .94). No significant differences in cognitive performance were observed at 3 and 6 months postoperatively. Adverse events were similar across groups.\n\nInterpretation: Intraoperative dexmedetomidine does not reduce postoperative delirium, contrasting with previous findings in intensive care settings. Timing of administration may be crucial. Trial registration: NCT00561678. Funding: Not specified.",
