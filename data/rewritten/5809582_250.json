The HerniaSurge Group developed guidelines to standardize care and improve patient outcomes, focusing on reducing recurrence rates and chronic pain.\n\nMethods: This trial involved an international expert group of surgeons and one anesthesiologist pain expert. Participants were eligible if they were involved in hernia-related research and performed various types of hernia repair. Evidence-based medicine training was provided, and 166 key questions were formulated. Literature searches were conducted up to January 1, 2015, and July 1, 2015, for level 1 publications. Articles were scored using Oxford, SIGN, and Grade methodologies.\n\nResults: The guidelines include 136 statements and 88 recommendations, graded as \"strong\" or \"weak.\" Key findings include the recommendation of mesh repair as the first choice, either by open or laparo-endoscopic techniques. The guidelines suggest that surgical treatment should be tailored to the surgeon's expertise, patient characteristics, and local resources. The incidence of chronic pain is 10-12%, decreasing over time.\n\nInterpretation: The HerniaSurge guidelines aim to improve groin hernia management globally. They emphasize shared decision-making, tailored surgical approaches, and the importance of surgeon expertise. The guidelines are expected to lead to better patient outcomes and more standardized care.",
