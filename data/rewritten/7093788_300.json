Participants were randomised 1:1 to receive either 25 mg/ml TXA or 0.9% sodium chloride (placebo) before wound closure. The primary outcome was postoperative bleeding measured by drain production in the first 24 hours. Randomisation was computer-generated with allocation concealment using sealed envelopes. Blinding included patients, clinicians, and outcome assessors. A sample size of 210 was planned to ensure adequate power.\n\nResults: From January 2016 to August 2018, 208 patients were randomised, with 202 included in the analysis (101 TXA, 101 placebo) using an intention-to-treat approach. TXA significantly reduced mean drain production at 24 hours (110 ml vs. 144 ml; mean difference 34 ml, 95% CI 8 to 60; p = 0.011). Early haematoma occurred in 1 patient in the TXA group versus 7 in the placebo group (OR 0.13, 95% CI 0.02 to 1.07; p = 0.057). No significant differences in other postoperative complications or late seroma aspirations were observed. No thromboembolic events were reported.\n\nInterpretation: Topical TXA before wound closure effectively reduces postoperative bleeding in mastectomy patients, offering a potential alternative to intravenous administration. Trial registration: NCT02627560.\n\nFunding: The study was funded by the involved institutions.",
