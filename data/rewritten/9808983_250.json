A 250-word version\n\nTitle: A Randomised Controlled Trial of Closed-Loop Vasopressor Control in Post-Cardiac Surgery Patients\n\nBackground: Vasopressors are essential for managing vasodilatory hypotension. We developed a closed-loop vasopressor (CLV) controller to efficiently correct hypotension during the perioperative period. This study tested the hypothesis that CLV management reduces hypotension compared to standard care in postcardiac surgery patients.\n\nMethods: This randomised controlled trial included 40 patients admitted to the ICU after cardiac surgery. Participants were randomised to either the CLV group or the control group, with norepinephrine infusion controlled by the CLV system or manually by ICU nurses, respectively. The primary outcome was the percentage of time with hypotension (MAP <65 mm Hg) over a 2-hour period. Randomisation was performed using a computer-generated sequence, and allocation was concealed. Blinding was not applicable.\n\nResults: The CLV group had significantly less hypotension (1.4% [0.9–2.3]) compared to the control group (12.5% [9.9–24.3]; location difference, −9.8% [95% CI, −5.4 to −15.9]; P < .001). The CLV group also maintained MAP between 65 and 75 mm Hg for a greater percentage of time (95% [89–96] vs 66% [59–77]; location difference, 27.6% [95% CI, 34.3–19.0]; P < .001). No adverse events occurred in either group.\n\nInterpretation: CLV control of norepinephrine infusion significantly reduces postoperative hypotension compared to manual control in ICU patients after cardiac surgery.\n\nTrial registration: [Trial registration number]\n\nFunding: [Source of funding]",
