A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Antimicrobial Drapes in Primary Knee Arthroplasty\n\nBackground: Periprosthetic joint infection (PJI) is a persistent complication following arthroplasty. This study investigates whether antimicrobial drapes reduce intraoperative microbial contamination in primary knee arthroplasty.\n\nMethods: An investigator-initiated, two-arm, non-blinded, multicenter, randomised controlled trial was conducted across five hospitals in Denmark. Eligible participants were over 18 years, undergoing primary knee arthroplasty, excluding those with iodine allergy, prior knee surgery, septic arthritis, recent antibiotics, or inability to consent. Randomisation was computer-generated, with 1659 patients assigned to either the intervention (antimicrobial drape) or control group. The primary outcome was the proportion of contaminated patients, assessed intraoperatively. Analysis was per-protocol.\n\nResults: Of 1659 randomised, 603 in the intervention and 584 in the control group were analysed. Contamination was observed in 10% of the intervention group compared to 15% in the control group (odds ratio 0.61 [95% CI 0.43 to 0.87]; p = 0.005), with a relative risk reduction of 35% (95% CI 12.3 to 52.5) and a number needed to treat of 18. Female sex and surgery in the central region were associated with lower contamination odds. No adverse events were reported.\n\nInterpretation: The use of antimicrobial drapes significantly reduced contamination risk, indicating their potential role in infection prevention. Further studies are warranted to evaluate their effect on infection rates.\n\nTrial registration: [Trial registration number]\n\nFunding: [Source of funding]",
