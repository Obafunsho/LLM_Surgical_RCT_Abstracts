This study aimed to investigate current practices among anaesthesiologists in measuring and managing blood pressure and cardiac output, and guiding fluid administration in noncardiac surgery.\n\nMETHODS: We conducted a web-based survey among members of the European Society of Anaesthesiology and Intensive Care (ESAIC) in October and November 2021. The survey included 30 questions on haemodynamic monitoring and management, and fluid therapy. A total of 615 fully completed surveys were analysed.\n\nRESULTS: Arterial catheters are usually not placed before induction of general anaesthesia (61%) even when invasive blood pressure monitoring is planned. Mean arterial pressure (87%) with lower intervention thresholds of 65 mmHg or 20% below pre-operative baseline is primarily used to guide blood pressure management. Cardiac output is most frequently measured using pulse wave analysis (92%). However, only one-third of respondents (almost) always use cardiac output to guide haemodynamic management in high-risk patients. Dynamic cardiac preload variables are more frequently used to guide haemodynamic management than cardiac output. Standardised treatment protocols are rarely used for haemodynamic management (23%). Crystalloids are primarily used for fluid therapy, with a decline in the use of 0.9% saline and hydroxyethyl starch over the last decade. Fluid responsiveness is assessed using dynamic preload variables and fluid challenges, most commonly with 250 ml of fluid.\n\nINTERPRETATION: This survey provides insights into current haemodynamic monitoring and management practices among anaesthesiologists in noncardiac surgery.",
