A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass vs Best Medical Treatment in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes and Early-Stage CKD\n\nBackground: Early-stage chronic kidney disease (CKD) with microalbuminuria in type 2 diabetes is linked to cardiovascular events and progression to end-stage renal disease.\n\nMethods: This single-center, randomised controlled trial recruited 100 patients with type 2 diabetes, obesity (BMI 30-35), and stage G1 to G3 and A2 to A3 CKD from April 1, 2013, to March 31, 2016. Participants were randomised 1:1 to Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) or best medical treatment. The primary outcome was remission of albuminuria (uACR <30 mg/g) at 24 months. Randomisation was computer-generated, and allocation was concealed. Blinding was not applied.\n\nResults: 51 patients were randomised to RYGB and 49 to best medical treatment. Intention-to-treat analysis showed albuminuria remission in 82% (95% CI, 72%-93%) of RYGB patients vs 55% (95% CI, 39%-70%) in the control group (P = .006). CKD remission rates were 82% (95% CI, 72%-92%) for RYGB and 48% (95% CI, 32%-64%) for controls (P = .002). Geometric mean uACRs were 55% lower in the RYGB group (10.7 mg/g) compared to controls (23.6 mg/g) (P < .001). No significant difference in serious adverse events was observed.\n\nInterpretation: RYGB was more effective than best medical treatment in achieving albuminuria and CKD remission in patients with type 2 diabetes and obesity.
