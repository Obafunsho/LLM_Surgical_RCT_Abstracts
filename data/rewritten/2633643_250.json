A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Acupuncture for Pain Management in Surgical Oncology Patients Undergoing Thoracotomy\n\nBackground: This randomised controlled trial aimed to evaluate the efficacy of a specially developed acupuncture technique in reducing postoperative pain and analgesic use in surgical oncology patients undergoing thoracotomy.\n\nMethods: A total of 162 cancer patients scheduled for thoracotomy were randomised to receive either A) preoperative implantation of small intradermal needles retained for 4 weeks (intervention) or B) preoperative placement of sham needles (control). The primary outcome was pain intensity measured by the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) at 30 days post-surgery. Secondary outcomes included chronic pain assessments at 60 and 90 days, in-patient pain, and medication use. Randomisation was conducted using a computer-generated sequence with allocation concealment. Blinding was maintained for patients, clinicians, and outcome assessors.\n\nResults: At 30 days, there was no significant difference in BPI pain intensity scores between the intervention and control groups (mean difference = 0.05, 95% CI: -0.64 to 0.74; p=0.9). Secondary outcomes also showed no significant differences. Adverse events were not reported.\n\nInterpretation: The acupuncture technique did not significantly reduce pain or analgesic use compared to sham acupuncture.
