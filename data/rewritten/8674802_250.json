A 250-word version\n\nTitle: A Randomised Controlled Trial of a Multimodal Delirium Prevention Intervention in Older Surgical Patients\n\nBackground: Delirium significantly worsens outcomes in elderly patients undergoing elective surgery. This study evaluates a multifaceted intervention to reduce postoperative delirium incidence and duration.\n\nMethods: This stepped-wedge cluster randomised trial was conducted in five German tertiary medical centers. Participants were 1470 patients aged 70 years and older undergoing elective orthopedic, general, or cardiac surgery from November 2017 to April 2019. The intervention included structured delirium education for caregivers and daily assessment of patient delirium risk factors, with tailored prevention strategies. Randomisation was computer-generated, and allocation was concealed. Outcome assessors and patients were blinded. The primary outcome was postoperative delirium incidence, measured daily for seven days post-surgery.\n\nResults: Of 1470 patients, 763 (51.9%) were male, median age 77 years. The intervention reduced delirium incidence (odds ratio, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.77-0.98; P = .02) and percentage of days with delirium (5.3% vs 6.9%; P = .03). Significant effects were observed in orthopedic and abdominal surgeries (odds ratio, 0.59; 95% CI, 0.35-0.99; P = .047), but not in cardiac surgeries. No adverse events were reported.\n\nInterpretation: The intervention effectively reduced delirium in older patients undergoing elective non-cardiac surgeries.
