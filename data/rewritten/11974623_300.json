  "abstract": "Title: Randomised Controlled Trial of Oxiris Membrane in Cardiac Surgery\n\nBackground: Cardiac surgery involving cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) can trigger a proinflammatory response, potentially leading to adverse outcomes. This study assessed whether the Oxiris membrane, an AN-69 hemadsorption device, could mitigate inflammation, preserve endothelial function, and improve postoperative outcomes in patients at high risk of inflammation.\n\nMethods: Conducted at Amiens University Hospital, France, this single-center, randomized, non-blind, parallel-group trial included adult patients scheduled for cardiac surgery with expected CPB duration over 90 minutes. Participants were randomized 1:1 to the Oxiris group, receiving hemadsorption via the Oxiris membrane on a Prismaflex device at 450 ml/min during CPB, or the standard group without the device. The primary outcome was the microvascular flow index on day 1 post-surgery. Secondary outcomes included a composite of adverse events within 30 days. Randomization was performed using Clinsight software with random block sizes of 10. The analysis was intention-to-treat.\n\nResults: Between October 2019 and November 2022, 70 patients were randomized (35 per group). Two patients in the Oxiris group were excluded post-randomization. The microvascular flow index did not significantly differ between groups on day 1: difference (95% CI) Oxiris minus standard at -0.17 (-0.44 to 0.10); P = 0.2. Composite adverse outcomes were similar (Oxiris: 14/33 [42%] vs. standard: 12/35 [35%]; P = 0.7). No significant differences in cytokine or angiopoietin levels were observed. Adverse events were not significantly different between groups.\n\nInterpretation: The Oxiris membrane did not demonstrate benefits in microcirculation or major cardiovascular events in patients undergoing prolonged CPB.
