A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Decision Support Interventions for Older Women with Breast Cancer\n\nBackground: This cluster randomised controlled trial (cRCT) assessed the impact of decision support interventions (DESIs) on treatment decision-making in older women with breast cancer.\n\nMethods: Conducted in 46 breast units across England and Wales, the study included women aged 70 years or above with operable breast cancer. Units were randomised 1:1 to either DESIs or usual care, stratified by primary endocrine therapy and chemotherapy rates. The DESIs comprised an online tool, booklet, and decision aid. The primary outcome was quality of life (QoL) at 6 months, measured using the EORTC QLQ-C30. Secondary outcomes included decision quality, survival, and treatment choice. Randomisation was by block, and allocation was concealed. Blinding was not feasible due to the nature of the intervention.\n\nResults: A total of 1339 women were randomised (670 intervention, 669 usual care) between December 2015 and June 2018. Intention-to-treat analysis revealed no significant difference in global QoL at 6 months (difference -0.20, 95% CI -2.69 to 2.29; P = 0.900). In women offered a choice, knowledge about treatments was significantly greater in the intervention arm (94% vs. 74%; P = 0.003). Treatment choice was altered, with a higher rate of primary endocrine therapy in the intervention group (21.0% vs. 15.4%; P = 0.029) and a lower chemotherapy rate (10.3% vs. 14.8%; P = 0.013). Survival was similar in both arms, with no significant adverse events reported.\n\nInterpretation: DESIs increased knowledge of treatment options, facilitated shared decision-making, and influenced treatment selection in older women with breast cancer.\n\nTrial registration: EudraCT 2015-004220-61, ISRCTN46099296.\n\nFunding: This study was funded by the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR).",
