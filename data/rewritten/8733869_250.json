This trial evaluates whether the Organ Care System (OCS) Liver, a portable normothermic machine perfusion system, reduces early allograft dysfunction (EAD) and ischemic biliary complications (IBCs).\n\nMethods: This multicenter randomised clinical trial was conducted at 20 US liver transplant programs from November 2016 to October 2019. Participants were adults listed for liver transplant. Donor livers were randomised 1:1 to OCS or ICS. The primary outcome was EAD incidence within 7 days posttransplant. Randomisation was via an Interactive Web Response System, with allocation concealment. Blinding was not feasible for clinicians, but outcome assessors were blinded. \n\nResults: Of 300 randomised participants, 151 received OCS and 142 received ICS. The per-protocol analysis showed a significant reduction in EAD with OCS (18% vs 31%; P = .01). OCS also reduced moderate to severe lobular inflammation (6% vs 13%; P = .004) and increased use of livers from donors after cardiac death (51% vs 26%; P = .007). IBC incidence was lower at 6 months (1.3% vs 8.5%; P = .02) and 12 months (2.6% vs 9.9%; P = .02) with OCS. \n\nInterpretation: OCS Liver preservation reduces EAD and IBC, enhancing donor liver use. \n\nTrial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02522871\n\nFunding: Not specified.",
