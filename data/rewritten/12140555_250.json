A 250-word version\n\nTitle: A Randomised Controlled Trial Comparing Epidural and Paravertebral Analgesia for Minimally Invasive Esophagectomy\n\nBackground: Paravertebral analgesia may offer a promising alternative to epidural analgesia, potentially reducing side effects and enhancing postoperative recovery in patients undergoing minimally invasive esophagectomy (MIE).\n\nMethods: This open-label, multicenter, randomised controlled superiority trial was conducted in four Dutch centers. Adult patients scheduled for transthoracic MIE with intrathoracic anastomosis were randomised to receive either epidural or paravertebral analgesia. The primary outcome was the Quality of Recovery (QoR-40) score on the third postoperative day (POD3). Randomisation was stratified per center using block randomisation, and allocation was not concealed. The trial was registered in the Dutch Trial Register (NL8037).\n\nResults: From December 2019 to June 2022, 192 patients were randomised: 94 to epidural and 98 to paravertebral analgesia. The intention-to-treat analysis showed no significant difference in QoR-40 scores on POD3 between groups (mean difference: 3.7, 95% CI: −2.3 to 9.7; P = 0.268). Epidural patients had higher QoR-40 scores on POD1 and 2 and lower pain scores. More epidural patients required vasopressors on POD1. Urinary catheters were removed earlier in the paravertebral group. No significant differences were found in postoperative complications or hospital/intensive care unit stay.\n\nInterpretation: This trial did not demonstrate the superiority of paravertebral over epidural analgesia regarding quality of recovery on POD3 after MIE. Both techniques are effective and can be offered in clinical practice. The trial was funded by institutional sources.",
