Participants aged 65 years or older with stage III NSCLC were eligible. The trial randomised participants to receive either oral vinorelbine with cisplatin and radiotherapy or standard cisplatin-based CCRT. The primary outcome was overall response rate (ORR) at 3 months post-treatment. Secondary outcomes included progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). Randomisation was computer-generated, and allocation was concealed using sealed envelopes. Blinding was not applied to patients or clinicians, but outcome assessors were blinded.\n\nResults: A total of 200 participants were randomised: 100 to the intervention group and 100 to the control group, between January 2020 and June 2021. Analysis was conducted on 98 participants in the intervention group and 97 in the control group using an intention-to-treat approach. The ORR was 54% in the intervention group compared to 37% in the control group (p = 0.02). The median PFS was 12.5 months in the intervention group versus 9.2 months in the control group. Adverse events included grade 3 neutropenia in 9% of the intervention group and 4% in the control group. No treatment-related deaths were reported.\n\nInterpretation: Oral vinorelbine in CCRT demonstrates a favorable risk-benefit profile and improved ORR in elderly patients with locally advanced NSCLC. These findings suggest that oral vinorelbine could be a viable alternative to standard regimens, warranting further investigation.\n\nTrial registration: NCT12345678\n\nFunding: This study was funded by the National Cancer Institute.",
