A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Gastrointestinal Motility Agents in Elective Colorectal Surgery\n\nBackground: Postoperative ileus (POI) frequently complicates elective colorectal surgery, delaying gastrointestinal (GI) recovery. This study assesses the efficacy and safety of GI motility agents in this setting.\n\nMethods: A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) was conducted. Seven RCTs involving 849 patients were included. Participants were adults undergoing elective colorectal surgery across various international settings. Interventions included prokinetics and laxatives, compared to placebo or standard ERAS care. The primary outcome was GI-2 recovery, defined as tolerance of solid diet and stool passage, measured within the first postoperative week. Randomisation and allocation concealment methods varied across studies. Blinding was implemented for patients and outcome assessors. The analysis was intention-to-treat.\n\nResults: GI motility agents significantly accelerated GI-2 recovery (mean difference –1.01 days; 95% CI –1.29 to –0.73; p < 0.001) and reduced time to first defaecation (mean difference –1.07 days; 95% CI –1.40 to –0.73; p < 0.001). No significant differences were observed in safety outcomes, including anastomotic leak (OR 0.97; 95% CI 0.53 to 1.77), nasogastric tube reinsertion (OR 0.86; 95% CI 0.49 to 1.51), or readmission rates (OR 1.03; 95% CI 0.62 to 1.72). Adverse events were not significantly different between groups.\n\nInterpretation: GI motility agents enhance postoperative GI recovery without compromising safety. Given their low cost, wide availability, and favourable safety profile, they may be integrated into ERAS protocols. Further high-quality, standardised trials are needed to confirm their benefits across diverse surgical populations. Trial registration: PROSPERO CRD420250655358. Funding: Not specified.",
