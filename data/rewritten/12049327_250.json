This study evaluates the BEACON Caresystem, a decision support tool, in reducing ventilation duration.\n\nMethods: This multicentre, randomised controlled trial included adult ICU patients ventilated for over 24 hours. Participants were randomised to receive either BEACON Caresystem advice (intervention) or usual care (control). The primary outcome was the duration of mechanical ventilation from intubation to successful extubation. Randomisation was computer-generated, with allocation concealment via sealed envelopes. Blinding was not feasible.\n\nResults: Between September 2017 and March 2020, 252 patients were randomised (58 intervention, 54 control). Analysis included 112 patients due to early termination from COVID-19. No significant difference in ventilation duration was observed. However, the intervention group had fewer adverse events, primarily hypoxaemia, and lower tidal volumes. Adverse events occurred in 9% of the intervention group and 15% of the control group.\n\nInterpretation: The BEACON Caresystem did not significantly reduce ventilation duration but showed potential for reducing adverse events. Further studies are needed to confirm these findings.\n\nTrial registration: NCT12345678\n\nFunding: Supported by [Funding Source].",
