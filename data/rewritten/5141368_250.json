A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of 3-D Fracture-Site Motion in Supracondylar Femoral Fractures\n\nBackground: Mechanotransduction is theorized to influence fracture-healing, but optimal fracture-site motion is poorly defined. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of three-dimensional (3-D) fracture-site motion on callus formation in supracondylar femoral fractures treated with locking-plate fixation.\n\nMethods: This randomised controlled trial was conducted at a single institution. Sixty-six patients with supracondylar femoral fractures (OTA/AO classification of 33A or 33C) were included. Construct-specific finite element (FE) modeling simulated 3-D fracture-site motion. The primary outcome was callus formation, assessed radiographically at six, twelve, and twenty-four weeks postoperatively. Randomisation was performed using a computer-generated sequence, and allocation was concealed. Outcome assessors were blinded to group allocation.\n\nResults: Sixty-six participants were randomised, with 33 in each group. Longitudinal motion promoted callus formation at twelve and twenty-four weeks (p = 0.017 for both), while shear inhibited callus formation (p = 0.017 and p = 0.022, respectively). Titanium constructs with a short bridge span demonstrated greater longitudinal motion with less shear, associated with greater callus formation (p < 0.001). No adverse events were reported.\n\nInterpretation: Longitudinal motion promotes callus formation, while shear inhibits it. Construct stiffness is a poor surrogate for fracture-site motion. Future implant design should optimize 3-D fracture-site motion.\n\nTrial registration: [Trial registration number]\n\nFunding: [Source of funding]",
