Participants were randomised 1:1 to receive either the brand-name or generic formulation under fasting and fed conditions. The primary outcome was pharmacokinetic parameters measured over 48 hours. Randomisation was computer-generated, and allocation was concealed. Blinding was not applied.\n\nResults: In the fasting study, 36 participants were randomised, with 35 analysed. In the fed study, 36 were randomised, with 34 analysed. Both formulations were bioequivalent, with geometric least-squares mean ratios for C max, AUC 0-t, and AUC 0-∞ within 80.00%-125.00%. In the fasting study, the mean C max for oxycodone was 50.9 ± 10.9 ng/mL for the brand-name and 52.1 ± 9.58 ng/mL for the generic. No serious adverse events were reported. Mild adverse events occurred in 33.3% of the generic and 30.6% of the brand-name groups in the fasting study, and 25.7% and 27.8% in the fed study, respectively. Common adverse events included dizziness, lethargy, and nausea.\n\nInterpretation: The study demonstrated bioequivalence and good safety profiles for both formulations, supporting their use in Chinese patients with chronic pain. The results provide a basis for further development and clinical application of these formulations in the Chinese population.\n\nTrial registration: CTR20212790, ChiCTR2000029198\n\nFunding: Shandong Luye Pharma Co., Ltd.",
