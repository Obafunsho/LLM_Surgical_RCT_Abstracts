TAVR-AA was performed in a hybrid operating room (OR), while TAVR-TF was conducted in either catheterization labs (n = 16) or a hybrid OR (n = 34). Disposable radiation shielding pads (RADPAD) or a placebo were used in a blinded manner. The primary outcome was operator radiation exposure, measured in mRad.\n\nResults: Operator radiation exposure was significantly higher in TAVR-AA compared to TAVR-TF (median 15.1 mRad [IQR 8.6, 32.4] vs 5.5 mRad [IQR 2.4, 9.8], P < .001). TAVR-TF procedures in hybrid ORs resulted in higher exposure than in catheterization labs (median 9.0 mRad [IQR 4.5, 11.9] vs 2.2 mRad [IQR 1.3, 2.8], P < .001). The use of RADPAD did not reduce exposure (median 9.0 mRad [IQR 4.5, 14.7] vs 9.4 mRad [IQR 2.8, 19.5], P = .82).\n\nInterpretation: Hybrid ORs were associated with increased operator radiation exposure. AA procedures had the highest exposure levels, particularly relevant for transcatheter mitral valve replacement. Disposable shielding did not mitigate exposure. Further evaluation of radiation shielding in hybrid ORs is warranted.",
