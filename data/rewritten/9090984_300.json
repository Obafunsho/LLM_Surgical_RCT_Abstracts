A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of N-acetylcysteine Plus Amiodarone for Prevention of Postoperative Atrial Fibrillation\n\nBackground: Postoperative atrial fibrillation (AF) is a common complication associated with increased stroke risk. This study aimed to determine if N-acetylcysteine reduces the incidence of postoperative AF by mitigating inflammation and oxidative stress.\n\nMethods: This double-blind, placebo-controlled trial included 154 patients at high risk of postoperative AF undergoing major thoracic surgery. Participants were randomised to receive N-acetylcysteine plus amiodarone or placebo plus amiodarone. Randomisation was computer-generated, and allocation was concealed. Patients, clinicians, and outcome assessors were blinded. The primary outcome was sustained AF >30 s by telemetry or symptoms requiring intervention confirmed by ECG within 7 days post-surgery. Systemic markers of inflammation and oxidative stress were assessed immediately post-surgery and on day 2. Patients were followed monthly for AF recurrence over 1 year.\n\nResults: Postoperative AF occurred in 15 of 78 patients (19%) receiving N-acetylcysteine and 13 of 76 (17%) receiving placebo (odds ratio, 1.24; 95.1% CI, 0.53–2.88; p = 0.615). The trial was stopped at interim analysis for futility. Three patients with postoperative AF were discharged in AF. At 1 year, 7 of 28 patients with postoperative AF (25%) had recurrent AF episodes. Inflammatory and oxidative stress markers were similar between groups. No significant adverse events were reported.\n\nInterpretation: Dual therapy with N-acetylcysteine plus amiodarone did not reduce the incidence of postoperative AF or markers of inflammation and oxidative stress compared to amiodarone alone. Recurrent AF episodes are common within 1 year post-surgery. Trial registration: [Trial registration number]. Funding: [Source of funding]. This study highlights the need for alternative strategies to prevent postoperative AF.",
