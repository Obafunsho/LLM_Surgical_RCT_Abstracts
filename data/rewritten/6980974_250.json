A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Carotid Revascularization and Medical Management for Asymptomatic Carotid Stenosis Trial (CREST-2): A Randomised Controlled Trial\n\nBackground: The CREST-2 trial evaluates the efficacy of carotid revascularization with intensive medical management (IMM) in patients with asymptomatic high-grade atherosclerotic stenosis. This analysis focuses on the credentialing process for carotid artery stenting (CAS) interventionists.\n\nMethods: CREST-2 is a pair of randomised trials with interventionists credentialed based on a review of their last 25 consecutive CAS cases and self-reported lifetime experience. Additional cases were required for those needing further training. The Interventional Management Committee (IMC) reviewed cases from March 21, 2014, to October 14, 2017.\n\nResults: A total of 334 interventionists submitted 8311 cases. Initial approval was granted to 9% (30/334) of interventionists, increasing to 46% (153/334) after additional training. The median lifetime case experience for approved interventionists was 211.5. The case rate was significantly associated with initial approval (P < .00001).\n\nInterpretation: The credentialing process identified skilled interventionists for CREST-2, emphasizing the importance of recent high-volume experience. Approval was not influenced by operator specialty.",
