A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial on the Impact of Cardiovascular Drugs on Myocardial Injury After Noncardiac Surgery\n\nBackground: Myocardial injury, defined by elevated cardiac troponin (cTn) levels, is associated with increased postoperative mortality following noncardiac surgery. This study investigates the efficacy of cardiovascular drugs in reducing mortality related to myocardial injury after noncardiac surgery (MINS).\n\nMethods: This randomised controlled trial was conducted across multiple international centers. Eligible participants were adults undergoing noncardiac surgery, identified by elevated cTn levels within 30 days post-surgery. Participants were randomised to receive either a regimen of cardiovascular drugs (aspirin, antihypertensives, statins) or standard care. Randomisation was computer-generated, with allocation concealment achieved through sealed envelopes. Outcome assessors were blinded to group assignments.\n\nResults: A total of 200 participants were randomised: 100 to the intervention group and 100 to the control group, recruited between January 2020 and June 2021. Analysis included 98 participants in the intervention group and 97 in the control group, following an intention-to-treat approach. The primary outcome was the reduction in postoperative mortality within 30 days, showing a significant effect size (hazard ratio = 0.75, 95% CI 0.60 to 0.90; p = 0.01). Adverse events were mild, with 3% of the intervention group and 1% of the control group experiencing mild gastrointestinal side-effects.\n\nInterpretation: The use of cardiovascular drugs significantly reduces mortality associated with MINS. Routine monitoring of cTn levels and early intervention with cardiovascular drugs are recommended for high-risk patients to improve postoperative outcomes.\n\nTrial registration: NCT12345678\n\nFunding: This trial was funded by the National Institutes of Health.",
