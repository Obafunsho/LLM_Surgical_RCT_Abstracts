A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Infrapatellar Fat Pad Excision in Minimally Invasive Total Knee Arthroplasty: A Randomised Controlled Trial\n\nBackground: The impact of infrapatellar fat pad excision during minimally invasive total knee arthroplasty (MIS TKA) on patella baja, anterior knee pain, and function remains controversial.\n\nMethods: This single-center, randomised controlled trial included 90 patients undergoing MIS TKA, randomised into two groups: 45 patients with complete infrapatellar fat pad excision and 45 without. Randomisation was performed using a computer-generated sequence with allocation concealment. The primary outcome was anterior knee pain, measured at 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, and 1 year postoperatively. Secondary outcomes included patellar tendon shortening, Knee Society Score (KSS), functional subscore, and patellar complications. Blinding was applied to outcome assessors.\n\nResults: At final follow-up, no significant differences were observed in patellar tendon shortening, KSS, functional subscore, or knee flexion between groups. However, anterior knee pain was more prevalent in the excision group (8.3% versus 0%; p = 0.03; 95% CI, −0.007 to 0.174). No patellar complications were reported in either group. Complete follow-up data were available for 77 of 90 patients (86%).\n\nInterpretation: Infrapatellar fat pad excision in MIS TKA is associated with increased anterior knee pain. Surgeons should consider preserving the fat pad if adequate exposure is achievable without excision.\n\nTrial registration: [Trial registration number]\n\nFunding: [Source of funding]",
