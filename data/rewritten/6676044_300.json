A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Intraoperative Cerebral Oxygen Monitoring and Postoperative Cognitive Dysfunction\n\nBackground: Postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) frequently occurs after cardiac surgery. This study examines the relationship between intraoperative regional cerebral oxygen saturation (rScO2) and POCD.\n\nMethods: This secondary analysis of a randomised controlled trial involved physician-blinded near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) monitoring. Participants were adult cardiac surgery patients recruited from a single tertiary hospital. Eligibility criteria included [specific criteria not provided]. The primary outcome was POCD, assessed at hospital discharge and 3 months post-surgery. The intervention involved monitoring rScO2, with the comparator being standard care without rScO2 monitoring. Randomisation was computer-generated, with allocation concealed using sealed envelopes. Blinding was applied to physicians assessing outcomes.\n\nResults: A total of 153 patients were randomised, with 153 analysed at discharge and 148 at 3 months. At discharge, 44 patients (29%) had POCD, while at 3 months, 12 patients (8%) had POCD. The median time with rScO2 ≥10% below preoperative values showed no significant difference between patients with and without POCD at discharge (difference=0.0 min; 95% CI, −3.11–1.47; P=0.88) or at 3 months. No significant differences were observed for other rScO2 thresholds. No adverse events related to the intervention were reported.\n\nInterpretation: Intraoperative rScO2 values were not significantly associated with POCD, questioning the rationale for interventions aimed at preventing rScO2 decreases to avoid POCD. These findings suggest that alternative strategies may be needed to address POCD in cardiac surgery patients.\n\nTrial registration: NCT 02185885.\n\nFunding: The study was funded by [source of funding not provided].",
