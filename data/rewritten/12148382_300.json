A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Electrocoagulation vs. Radiofrequency Ablation for Great Saphenous Vein: A Randomised Controlled Trial\n\nBackground: Thermoablation is a preferred alternative to traditional surgery for primary varicose veins. This study evaluates the long-term efficacy and safety of electrocoagulation ablation (EA) compared to radiofrequency ablation (RFA) for the great saphenous vein (GSV).\n\nMethods: This double-blind, randomised controlled trial was conducted at the Dante Pazzanese Institute of Cardiology and the Adventist Hospital of São Paulo. Fifty-seven adults with primary chronic venous insufficiency were randomly assigned to EA or RFA using sealed envelopes. The primary outcome was GSV occlusion, assessed via duplex ultrasound at 1 week, 3 months, 6 months, and annually. Secondary outcomes included complication rates and quality of life improvements, measured by the Aberdeen Varicose Vein Questionnaire. Randomisation was per-patient, and blinding was maintained for patients and outcome assessors.\n\nResults: From November 2014 to May 2016, 57 patients were randomised: 28 to EA and 29 to RFA. At a median follow-up of 4.8 years, occlusion rates were 89.7% for EA and 66.7% for RFA (P = .001). No significant differences were observed in complication rates or quality of life scores between groups. Adverse events were similar, with no procedure-related complications reported.\n\nInterpretation: EA achieved higher long-term GSV occlusion rates compared to RFA, with similar safety and quality of life outcomes. This suggests EA as a viable alternative to RFA for GSV ablation. Trial registration: NCT02139085. Funding: Dante Pazzanese Institute.",
