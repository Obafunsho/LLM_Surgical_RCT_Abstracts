This study investigates the psycho-physiological effects of music on stress in inexperienced and experienced operators during a simulated surgical task.\n\nMethods: This non-blinded, randomised crossover trial was conducted at the University of Auckland. Participants included 15 medical students and 12 vascular surgeons. Eligibility criteria excluded those with significant physical impairments, pregnancy, cardiac history, or hearing impairments. Participants performed a carotid patch-angioplasty under two conditions: self-selected music and ambient theatre noise (control). The primary outcome was the effect of music on psychological (STAI-6, SURG-TLX) and physiological responses (heart rate variability) measured immediately post-task. Randomisation was by coin toss, with allocation concealment. Blinding was not possible.\n\nResults: Music did not affect task speed or accuracy. SURG-TLX scores increased from baseline to control (Δ32 [22–42]) and music (Δ30 [20–40]), with no difference between conditions. STAI-6 scores increased similarly. Heart rate increased (peak Δ5.1 bpm [3.0–7.1], p < 0.0001), with music exacerbating sympathetic (SNS index: 0.14 [0.004–0.27], p = 0.042) and reducing parasympathetic activity (PNS index: −0.11 [−0.22 to −0.008], p = 0.032). Experienced operators performed faster and more accurately, with no differential response to music.\n\nInterpretation: Despite positive perceptions of music, it did not improve task performance or reduce stress markers. No adverse events were reported. Trial registration: ACTRN12623000306617. Funding: Not specified.",
