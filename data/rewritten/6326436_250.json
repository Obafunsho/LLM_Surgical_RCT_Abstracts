A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Papaverine Concentrations for Vasospasm Prevention in Radial Artery Grafts\n\nBackground: This study aimed to compare the efficacy of two papaverine concentrations (0.5 mg/ml and 2 mg/ml) for vasospasm prevention and their impact on endothelial integrity in radial artery (RA) grafts used in coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery.\n\nMethods: In a randomised controlled trial, RA segments were harvested from 10 CABG patients at John Paul II Hospital. The segments were randomly assigned to two groups: 0.5 mg/ml papaverine (n=12) and 2 mg/ml papaverine (n=12). The primary outcome was vasodilatory effect, assessed using ex vivo myography over 60 minutes. Endothelial integrity was evaluated by measuring the percentage of vessel circumference positive for CD34.\n\nResults: The 2 mg/ml papaverine group showed stronger vasodilatation (mean difference = 24.67%, 95% CI 15.23 to 34.11; p < 0.001) but caused more endothelial damage (mean difference = 22.63%, 95% CI 8.91 to 36.35; p = 0.002) compared to the 0.5 mg/ml group. No adverse events were reported.\n\nInterpretation: While 2 mg/ml papaverine provided superior vasodilatation, it resulted in significant endothelial damage. The 0.5 mg/ml concentration preserved endothelial integrity better, suggesting it may be more suitable for RA grafts in CABG.\n\nTrial registration: Not provided.\n\nFunding: Not reported.",
