A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Hydroxyethyl Starch vs. Albumin in Cardiac Surgery\n\nBackground: The safety of third-generation hydroxyethyl starch (HES) solutions in cardiac surgery is uncertain. We aimed to assess whether intra-operative HES administration affects postoperative kidney function and haemostasis compared to human albumin.\n\nMethods: This single-centre, triple-blinded, parallel-group, randomised, non-inferiority trial was conducted at the Cleveland Clinic. We enrolled patients aged 40–85 scheduled for elective aortic valve replacement, with or without coronary artery bypass grafting, between June 2015 and February 2018. Participants were randomised 1:1 to receive 6% HES 130/0.4 or 5% human albumin. Randomisation was done using a secure web-based system, and allocation was concealed. The primary outcome was urinary neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) concentrations measured at baseline, 1 hour, and 24 hours post-surgery.\n\nResults: A total of 141 patients were analysed (69 HES, 72 albumin). Postoperative NGAL was slightly lower with HES (median 5 ng/ml) vs. albumin (median 5 ng/ml), but not non-inferior [ratio of geometric means 0.91, 95% CI 0.57 to 1.44; p = 0.15]. Nine of 11 coagulation measures were non-inferior. No significant adverse events were reported.\n\nInterpretation: HES administration during cardiac surgery showed similar effects on kidney function and haemostasis compared to albumin, but variability precluded non-inferiority conclusions. Long-term outcomes were similar between groups.\n\nTrial registration: NCTXXXXX\n\nFunding: Supported by [Funding Source].",
