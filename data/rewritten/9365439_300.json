Carotid artery stenting (CAS) with embolic protection is a newer treatment option. This study aims to compare CAS and CEA outcomes in asymptomatic, non-octogenarian patients.\n\nMethods: This randomised controlled trial involved 2544 patients with ≥70% asymptomatic carotid stenosis, randomised to CAS or CEA, in addition to standard medical therapy. Participants were recruited from two trials, with 1091 (548 CAS, 543 CEA) and 1453 (1089 CAS, 364 CEA) patients, respectively. The primary composite endpoint was any stroke, myocardial infarction, or death during the periprocedural period or ipsilateral stroke within 4 years. Randomisation was computer-generated, with allocation concealment. Neurologic assessors were blinded. The analysis was intention-to-treat.\n\nResults: The primary endpoint showed no significant difference between CAS and CEA (5.3% vs. 5.1%, HR = 1.02; 95% CI 0.7–1.5; P=.91). Periprocedural stroke rates were 2.7% for CAS and 1.5% for CEA (P=.07). Myocardial infarction rates were 0.6% for CAS and 1.7% for CEA (P=.01). Death rates were 0.1% for CAS and 0.2% for CEA (P=.62). Ipsilateral stroke rates post-procedure were similar (2.3% vs. 2.2%, P=.97). Adverse events were reported as periprocedural complications.\n\nInterpretation: CAS achieves comparable short- and long-term outcomes to CEA in asymptomatic, non-octogenarian patients.
