A 300-word version\n\nBackground: This randomised controlled trial evaluates the effectiveness of combined cup and stem anteversion in total hip arthroplasty (THA) using computer navigation to address abnormal femoral anteversion. Methods: Conducted at a single orthopedic center, 47 patients with abnormal femoral anteversion undergoing THA were randomised. Eligibility criteria included adults with a clinical indication for THA. The intervention group used computer navigation for combined anteversion, while the control group relied on the surgeon's estimation. The primary outcome was the precision and bias of stem anteversion, assessed postoperatively via CT scans over a 6-month period. Randomisation was computer-generated, and allocation was concealed using sealed envelopes. Blinding was applied to outcome assessors. Results: 47 patients were randomised, with 24 in the intervention group and 23 in the control group. Analysis was conducted per-protocol. The navigation group demonstrated a precision of 4.8° and a bias of 0.2°, while the control group showed a precision of 16.8° and a bias of 0.2°. Combined anteversion by CT was 37.6° ± 7°, with 96% of cases within the safe zone of 25° to 50°. No adverse events were reported in either group. Interpretation: The use of computer navigation in THA significantly enhances the precision of stem anteversion compared to traditional surgeon estimation, ensuring a higher percentage of cases fall within the safe anteversion zone.
