A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial on Ultrasound-Guided Vascular Access Techniques\n\nBackground: This study evaluates the efficacy of ultrasound-guided techniques for vascular access compared to traditional landmark-based methods.\n\nMethods: A randomised controlled trial was conducted with healthcare providers as the unit of randomisation. The sample size was calculated to detect a significant difference in procedure success rates. Participants were healthcare providers trained in vascular access, recruited from multiple hospitals. The intervention group used real-time ultrasound guidance, while the control group used landmark-based techniques. The primary outcome was the success rate of vascular access procedures, measured immediately post-procedure. Randomisation was computer-generated, and allocation was concealed using sealed envelopes. Blinding was applied to outcome assessors.\n\nResults: A total of 200 participants were randomised: 100 to the intervention group and 100 to the control group. Analysis included 98 in the intervention group and 97 in the control group, using an intention-to-treat approach. The intervention group showed a higher success rate (mean difference = 15%, 95% CI 10% to 20%; p < 0.001). Adverse events were reported in 3% of the intervention group and 1% of the control group, with no severe complications.\n\nInterpretation: Real-time ultrasound guidance significantly improves the success rate of vascular access procedures compared to landmark-based techniques. The trial was registered under number NCT12345678 and funded by the National Institutes of Health.",
