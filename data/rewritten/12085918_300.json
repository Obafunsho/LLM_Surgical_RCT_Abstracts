A 300-word version\n\nTitle: MATTERHORN: A Randomised Controlled Trial Comparing MitraClip Transcatheter Edge-to-Edge Repair and Surgical Mitral Valve Repair in High-Risk Heart Failure Patients with Functional Mitral Regurgitation\n\nBackground: Functional mitral regurgitation (FMR) is a frequent complication in heart failure, associated with increased morbidity and mortality. This study aimed to compare the efficacy and safety of MitraClip transcatheter edge-to-edge repair (M-TEER) versus surgical mitral valve repair in high-risk patients with heart failure and FMR.\n\nMethods: The MATTERHORN trial was a multicenter, prospective, open-label, non-inferiority trial. A total of 208 patients with significant FMR were randomized 1:1 to M-TEER or surgical repair. Inclusion criteria included FMR grade 3+ or 4+, LVEF ≥20%, and NYHA class ≥2. The primary outcome was a composite of death, heart failure hospitalization, mitral valve re-intervention, assist device implantation, or stroke within 1 year. Randomization was computer-generated, and allocation was concealed. Blinding was not applied.\n\nResults: 104 patients were randomized to each group. At 1 year, the primary endpoint occurred in 16.7% of the M-TEER group and 22.5% of the surgery group (mean difference: -6 percentage points; 95% CI: -17 to 6; P < 0.001 for non-inferiority). Recurrence of MR grade ≥3 was higher in the M-TEER group (8.9% vs. 1.5%). Adverse events were lower in the M-TEER group (41.0% vs. 77.3%), with serious adverse events at 35% in M-TEER and 66% in surgery.\n\nInterpretation: M-TEER demonstrated non-inferiority to surgery for the primary composite endpoint, with fewer adverse events, suggesting it as a viable alternative for high-risk patients. However, long-term data is needed to guide clinical decisions. Trial registration: NCTXXXXXXX. Funding: Supported by [Funding Source].",
