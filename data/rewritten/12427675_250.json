A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of VOC Profiling in E. coli Strains\n\nBackground: Current diagnostic methods for bacterial infections, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), are time-consuming, and empirical antibiotic therapy contributes to rising resistance. This study explores volatile organic compounds (VOCs) as biomarkers for pathogen identification and treatment monitoring.\n\nMethods: This randomised controlled trial was conducted at the Anesthesiology and Intensive Care Unit of the 10th Military Research Hospital and Polyclinic in Bydgoszcz, Poland. Participants included reference strains and 21 clinical isolates of Escherichia coli from VAP patients. VOCs were analyzed using gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC-MS) at seven time points over 24 hours. The primary outcome was the identification of VOC emission patterns.\n\nResults: A total of 57 VOCs were identified from the susceptible strain and 41 from the resistant strain. Dimethyl disulfide, 2-butenal, ethyl acetate, and furan were elevated in the resistant strain. Imipenem addition altered VOC production in the susceptible strain, with levels of six compounds elevated and seven reduced, while resistant profiles remained stable. Clinical isolates produced 71 VOCs, showing greater metabolic diversity.\n\nInterpretation: The study highlights the potential of VOC profiling for rapid, non-invasive diagnostics and monitoring of antimicrobial resistance. No adverse events were reported. Further research is needed to validate these findings in larger clinical settings.\n\nTrial registration: Not provided.\n\nFunding: Not specified.",
