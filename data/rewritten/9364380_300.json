A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Radiopaque Tissue Transfer System in Breast-Conserving Surgery\n\nBackground: This randomised controlled trial assessed whether a radiopaque tissue transfer and X-ray system (KliniTray™) could reduce the positive margin rate (PMR) in breast-conserving surgery (BCS) for non-palpable breast cancer associated with microcalcifications.\n\nMethods: Conducted at a single centre, 122 patients with microcalcification-associated breast cancer were randomised 1:1 to receive either KliniTray™ or the institutional standard orientation (ISO) procedure. The primary outcome was the PMR, measured using final histopathology. Randomisation was performed using permutated block randomisation with allocation concealment via closed envelopes. The study was open-label, with no blinding of outcome assessors, patients, or clinicians. The sample size was calculated to detect a 50% reduction in PMR with 80% power at a two-sided α level of 0.05.\n\nResults: Of the 122 randomised, 117 patients were analysed (60 in the KliniTray™ group and 57 in the ISO group) using an intention-to-treat approach. The final PMR was 31.7% for KliniTray™ and 26.3% for ISO (P = 0.127). Independent factors for positive margins included histological tumour size >30 mm (adjusted OR 10.73; 95% CI 3.14 to 36.75; P < 0.001) and specimen size >50 mm (adjusted OR 6.65; 95% CI 2.00 to 22.08; P = 0.002). Immediate re-excision reduced PMR by 13.6% (from 42.7% to 29.1%). No adverse events were reported.\n\nInterpretation: The KliniTray™ system did not significantly reduce PMR compared to ISO. However, intraoperative specimen radiography and immediate re-excision were effective in reducing PMR.\n\nTrial registration: DRKS00011527.\n\nFunding: Not specified.",
