A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Neurobehavioral Outcomes in Pediatric Open-Chest CPR: A Randomised Controlled Trial\n\nBackground: Limited data exist on neurobehavioral outcomes in children post-open-chest cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). This study aimed to evaluate neurobehavioral outcomes one year post-arrest in children receiving open-chest CPR during in-hospital cardiac arrest and identify factors associated with survival and good neurobehavioral outcomes.\n\nMethods: This secondary analysis of the Therapeutic Hypothermia after Pediatric Cardiac Arrest In-Hospital Trial included 56 children who received open-chest CPR. Neurobehavioral status was assessed using the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales, Second Edition (VABS-II) at baseline and 12 months post-arrest. The primary outcome was 12-month survival with VABS-II ≥70. Randomisation and allocation concealment methods were not applicable. Blinding was not specified.\n\nResults: Of 56 children, 49 (88%) were post-cardiac surgery, and 43 (77%) were <1 year old. Forty-four (79%) were cannulated for ECMO during CPR or within 6 hours of return of spontaneous circulation. Thirty-three (59%) survived to 12 months, and 22 (41%) survived with VABS-II decreased by ≤15 points from baseline. Of those with baseline VABS-II ≥70, 23 (51%) survived with VABS-II ≥70. ECMO use, renal replacement therapy, and higher maximum international normalized ratio were associated with lower 12-month survival with VABS-II ≥70.\n\nInterpretation: Approximately half of the children survived with good neurobehavioral outcomes one year after open-chest CPR. ECMO use and post-arrest renal or hepatic dysfunction may negatively impact neurobehavioral outcomes. Trial registration and funding details were not provided.",
