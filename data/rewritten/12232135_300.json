A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Inhaled Nitric Oxide in Cardiac Surgery\n\nBackground: Postoperative organ dysfunction, affecting kidneys, heart, and lungs, is a major challenge in adult cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). Inhaled nitric oxide (NO) is proposed for organ protection, but its efficacy remains inconclusive.\n\nMethods: This systematic review and meta-analysis included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing inhaled NO with placebo or standard care in adults undergoing cardiac surgery with CPB. The primary outcome was the incidence of acute kidney injury (AKI). Secondary outcomes included mechanical ventilation (MV) duration, cardiac troponin I (cTnI) levels, low cardiac output syndrome (LCOS), mortality, and length of stay (LOS) in the intensive care unit (ICU) and hospital. Subgroup analyses were conducted based on NO dosage and timing of administration. The GRADE approach assessed the certainty of evidence. Randomisation and allocation concealment methods were not specified. Blinding details were not provided.\n\nResults: Ten RCTs involving 838 patients were included. NO administration reduced AKI incidence (RR: 0.78; 95% CI: 0.64–0.94; p = 0.010) and cTnI levels. MV duration was slightly reduced (SMD: −0.17; 95% CI: −0.31 to −0.02; p = 0.025), particularly with postoperative administration (SMD: −0.39; 95% CI: −0.67 to −0.12; p = 0.005). No significant effects were observed for LCOS, mortality, ICU LOS, or hospital LOS. Adverse events were not reported.\n\nInterpretation: Inhaled NO may reduce AKI incidence and cTnI levels in adults undergoing cardiac surgery with CPB, but these effects did not consistently improve clinical outcomes. The observed reduction in MV duration was not significant after adjusting for publication bias. Further large, high-quality trials are needed. PROSPERO registration: CRD42025649095.
