A 250-word version\n\nBackground: This study evaluates the validation of disease-specific patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) for chronic venous disease (CVD) using a three-phase continuum framework.\n\nMethods: A literature search in OVID Embase and Medline identified English-language studies from January 1, 1993, to June 30, 2022, that used disease-specific PROMs for CVD. Studies were screened for eligibility, and data on validation were abstracted. PROMs were assessed for content validity, reliability, responsiveness, and expansion of the validation evidence base. PROMs were categorized into three groups based on disease manifestations: overall CVD (C1 to C6), C1 to C4 disease, and C5 to C6 disease.\n\nResults: Of 2338 unique studies screened, 112 met inclusion criteria. Eight disease-specific PROMs were identified. The Chronic Venous Insufficiency Questionnaire (CIVIQ) met validation criteria at all three phases for C1 to C4 disease, and the Charing Cross Venous Ulcer Questionnaire (CCVUQ) met criteria for C5 to C6 disease. No PROMs met all criteria for overall CVD (C1 to C6).\n\nInterpretation: Only two of the eight PROMs assessed met prespecified criteria for validation. The CIVIQ and CCVUQ should be considered for use in patients with C1 to C4 disease and C5 to C6 disease, respectively. Further validation work is necessary to enhance the use of PROMs in clinical practice.",
