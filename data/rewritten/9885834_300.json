Exclusion criteria were coronary artery bypass grafting, systemic hypertension, renal/hepatic failure, uncontrolled diabetes, LA allergy, coagulopathy, psychiatric illness, chronic opioid use, and lack of consent. Participants were randomised to receive either a pre-induction TTPB with 30 mL of 0.2% ropivacaine or no block. The primary outcome was intraoperative haemodynamic response, assessed by changes in MAP and HR. Secondary outcomes included perioperative fentanyl requirement and postoperative pain scores. Randomisation and allocation concealment methods were not specified. Blinding was not reported.\n\nResults: Fifteen patients were randomised, with 7 receiving TTPB and 8 in the control group. In the TTPB group, three patients required additional intraoperative fentanyl, compared to four in the control group. The mean intraoperative fentanyl consumption was lower in the TTPB group (7.93 ± 1.16 µg kg−1). Postoperative pain scores were also lower in the TTPB group. No adverse events related to the block were reported.\n\nInterpretation: Pre-induction TTPB may attenuate haemodynamic response to median sternotomy and reduce perioperative fentanyl requirement, suggesting its potential role in enhanced recovery pathways. Further randomised controlled trials with larger sample sizes are warranted to confirm these findings.\n\nTrial registration: Not provided.\n\nFunding: Not reported.",
