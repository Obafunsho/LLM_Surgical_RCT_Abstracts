A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of a Nomogram Model for Predicting Postoperative Delirium in Esophageal Cancer Patients\n\nBackground: Postoperative delirium (POD) is a significant complication following esophagectomy for esophageal cancer, affecting patient recovery and increasing healthcare costs. This study aimed to develop a predictive nomogram model for POD risk.\n\nMethods: In this randomised controlled trial, 396 patients undergoing esophagectomy for esophageal cancer were enrolled. Participants were randomly assigned to a training set (n=278) and a testing set (n=118). The primary outcome was the incidence of POD within 14 days post-surgery. LASSO regression identified key predictors, and a nomogram was constructed. Model performance was assessed using ROC curves, calibration curves, and decision curve analysis.\n\nResults: The incidence of POD was 35.4%. The nomogram included six predictors: postoperative pain, infections, dexmedetomidine use, propofol use, mechanical ventilation duration, and PNI. The model demonstrated strong discrimination with an AUC of 0.919 in the training set and 0.871 in the testing set. Calibration and decision curves indicated good agreement and clinical utility. No adverse events related to the intervention were reported.\n\nInterpretation: The nomogram effectively predicts POD risk in esophageal cancer patients post-surgery, providing a practical tool for clinicians to identify high-risk individuals and implement preventive strategies. This model can enhance patient outcomes by facilitating early intervention.\n\nTrial registration: Not provided.\n\nFunding: Not specified.",
