A 250-word version\n\nTitle: A Randomised Controlled Trial of Inhaled Epoprostenol vs. Inhaled Nitric Oxide in Lung Transplantation\n\nBackground: Inhaled nitric oxide (iNO) is used for pulmonary vasodilation and prevention of oxidative injury post-lung transplant (LT). Inhaled epoprostenol (iEPO) is a cost-effective alternative, lacking high-grade evidence.\n\nMethods: This randomised, blinded, parallel-designed equivalence trial included 201 adult LT patients from a health system between May 30, 2017, and March 21, 2020. Participants were stratified by prognostic features and randomised 1:1 to receive iNO or iEPO. Randomisation was computer-generated with allocation concealment. Blinding included participants, clinicians, data managers, and statisticians. The primary outcome was severe/grade 3 primary graft dysfunction (PGD-3) at 24, 48, or 72 hours post-LT. Intention-to-treat analysis was used.\n\nResults: 201 patients were randomised; 103 to iEPO and 98 to iNO. PGD-3 occurred in 46/103 (44.7%) iEPO and 39/98 (39.8%) iNO, with a risk difference of 4.9% (TOST 90% CI, –6.4% to 16.2%; P = .02 for equivalence). No significant differences in secondary outcomes or adverse events were observed.\n\nInterpretation: iEPO is equivalent to iNO in reducing PGD-3 risk post-LT. Trial Registration: NCT03081052. Funding: Health system-funded.",
