This study aims to evaluate the efficacy and risks of antithrombotic regimens in preventing major cardiovascular events, vascular limb events, and mortality in PAD patients.\n\nMethods: A systematic review and network meta-analysis (NMA) of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) was conducted. Eligible participants included individuals with PAD, defined by symptoms, previous procedures, or objective evidence of malperfusion. The intervention involved various antithrombotic regimens compared to placebo or other regimens. The primary outcome was a composite of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) and major adverse limb events (MALE) over the longest reported follow-up. Randomisation and allocation concealment methods were not specified. Blinding details were not provided. Data were extracted and analysed using intention-to-treat principles.\n\nResults: The NMA included RCTs with varying sample sizes. The primary outcome showed a significant reduction in MACE and MALE with certain antithrombotic regimens. Adverse events, including major bleeding, were reported, with varying frequencies across regimens. The study was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42023389262).\n\nInterpretation: The findings suggest that specific antithrombotic regimens can effectively reduce cardiovascular and limb events in PAD patients, although bleeding risks vary. Further research is needed to refine treatment recommendations.\n\nFunding: The study's funding source was not specified.",
