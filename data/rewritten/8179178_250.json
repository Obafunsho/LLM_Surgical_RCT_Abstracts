Participants were randomly assigned to receive either the CAPAC treatment (SQ3370) or conventional doxorubicin. The intervention involved a tetrazine-modified biopolymer (SQL70) injected at the tumor site, followed by systemic administration of a TCO-modified protodrug (SQP33). The primary outcome was the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of SQP33, measured over a 38-day period. Randomisation was achieved using a computer-generated sequence, with allocation concealment ensured by sealed envelopes. Blinding was applied to outcome assessors.\n\nResults: A total of 40 mice were randomised, with 20 in each group. The MTD of SQP33 was 19.1-times higher than conventional doxorubicin in mice. Pharmacokinetics in rats showed SQL70 captured multiple SQP33 doses at 10.8-times the MTD of doxorubicin, with reduced systemic toxicity. Adverse events were less frequent in the CAPAC group.\n\nInterpretation: The CAPAC platform significantly increased the MTD of doxorubicin with reduced toxicity, demonstrating potential for improved cancer treatment.
