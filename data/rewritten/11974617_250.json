A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Fully Closed-Loop Versus Usual Care Glucose Control in Major Abdominal Surgery\n\nBackground: Major abdominal surgery predisposes patients to perioperative hyperglycemia. This study evaluates the efficacy and safety of fully closed-loop (FCL) glucose control compared to usual care (UC) in this context.\n\nMethods: In this two-centre, open-label, randomised controlled trial, 38 patients aged ≥18 years undergoing major abdominal surgery at University Hospital Bern and University Hospital Basel were randomised (1:1) to FCL or UC glucose management. The primary outcome was the proportion of time with sensor glucose values in the target range of 5.6 to 10.0 mmol/L from hospital admission to discharge (max 20 days). Randomisation was performed using a minimization method, and the study was open-label with masked continuous glucose monitoring in the UC group.\n\nResults: Thirty-seven patients were analysed (18 FCL, 19 UC) using a modified intention-to-treat approach. The FCL group spent 80.1% ± 10.0% of time in the target range compared to 53.7% ± 19.7% in the UC group (P < 0.001). Mean glucose was 7.5 ± 0.5 mmol/L in the FCL group and 9.1 ± 2.4 mmol/L in the UC group (P = 0.015). No study-related serious adverse events occurred.\n\nInterpretation: FCL glucose control significantly improved glycemic management without increasing hypoglycemia risk. Automated insulin delivery is effective for minimizing hyperglycemia in complex surgical populations.\n\nTrial registration: NCT05392452\n\nFunding: Not specified.",
