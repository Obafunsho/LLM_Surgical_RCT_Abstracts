A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Early Psychosocial Intervention in Orthopaedic Trauma Patients\n\nBackground: Orthopaedic trauma patients frequently experience mobility impairment and psychosocial challenges. This study aimed to determine if an early psychosocial intervention improves physical function outcomes compared to usual care.\n\nMethods: This randomised controlled trial was conducted at a single hospital from November 2015 to February 2017. Participants were 112 orthopaedic trauma patients aged 18-85 years, excluding those with traumatic brain injury, communication barriers, or severe psychiatric conditions. Patients were randomised to integrative care (n=56) or usual care (n=56) using a computer-generated sequence with allocation concealment. Integrative care included usual trauma care plus psychosocial and movement strategies. The primary outcome was physical function, measured objectively (handgrip strength, active joint ROM, Lower Extremity Gain Scale) and subjectively (PROMIS®-PF, Tampa Scale of Kinesiophobia) at baseline, 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, and 1 year. Blinding was not applied.\n\nResults: At 6 months, no significant differences were found between groups in handgrip strength (right β=-0.0792, 95% CI -0.292 to 0.133, p=0.46; left β=-0.133, 95% CI -0.384 to 0.119, p=0.30) or Lower Extremity Gain Scale scores (β=-0.0303, 95% CI -0.191 to 0.131, p=0.71). Elbow flexion was 20° ± 10° greater in the integrative care group (p=0.05). Tampa Scale of Kinesiophobia scores showed no difference (β=0.0155, 95% CI -0.123 to 0.154, p=0.83). Analysis was per-protocol with 99 participants (integrative care n=50, usual care n=49). No adverse events were reported.\n\nInterpretation: Early psychosocial intervention did not significantly alter physical function recovery trajectories compared to usual care. Further research is needed to enhance early recovery interventions.\n\nTrial registration: [Trial registration number]\n\nFunding: [Source of funding]",
