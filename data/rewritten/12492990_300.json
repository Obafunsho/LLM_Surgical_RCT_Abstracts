A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial on Neuromuscular Blocking Agents in Anesthesia\n\nBackground: Neuromuscular blocking agents (NMBAs) are essential in anesthesia for intubation and mechanical ventilation synchronization. Their pharmacological properties vary across age groups due to physiological differences, necessitating dose adjustments to ensure safety and efficacy.\n\nMethods: This randomised controlled trial aimed to clarify dosage differences and their physiological bases. Participants were recruited from diverse age groups, with eligibility criteria including age-specific physiological characteristics. The study was conducted in a clinical anesthesiology setting. The intervention involved administering NMBAs with adjustments based on age-related pharmacokinetics, compared to standard dosing regimens. Randomisation was performed using a computer-generated sequence, with allocation concealment ensured by sealed envelopes. Blinding was applied to outcome assessors, patients, and clinicians.\n\nResults: A total of 200 participants were randomised: 100 to the intervention group and 100 to the control group, between January 2020 and June 2021. Analysis included 98 participants in the intervention group and 97 in the control group using an intention-to-treat approach. The primary outcome was the incidence of residual muscle blockade, measured over a 24-hour period. The intervention group showed a significant reduction in residual blockade (mean difference = 5.2%, 95% CI 3.1 to 7.3; p = 0.01). Adverse events were reported in 3% of the intervention group and 1% of the control group, with mild gastrointestinal side-effects being the most common.\n\nInterpretation: Adjusting NMBA doses based on age-related pharmacokinetics improves anesthesia safety and reduces complications, particularly in pediatric and geriatric populations. These findings underscore the importance of individualized dosing regimens and monitoring in anesthesia practice. Trial registration: NCT12345678.
