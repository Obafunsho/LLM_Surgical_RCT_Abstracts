  "abstract": "Title: A Randomised Controlled Trial of Isolated Hepatic Perfusion Versus Best Alternative Care for Uveal Melanoma Liver Metastases\n\nBackground: Uveal melanoma often metastasizes to the liver, with limited systemic treatment options. This study assesses isolated hepatic perfusion (IHP) versus best alternative care (BAC) for overall survival (OS) and health-related quality of life (HRQOL).\n\nMethods: In this multicenter, phase III randomised controlled trial, 93 patients with untreated isolated liver metastases from uveal melanoma were enrolled between 2013 and 2021. Patients were randomised 1:1 to receive a one-time IHP treatment or BAC, with no crossover allowed. The primary endpoint was the 24-month OS rate. Randomisation was computer-generated, and allocation was concealed. Outcome assessors were blinded. The intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis included 43 patients in the IHP group and 44 in the control group.\n\nResults: The 24-month OS rate was 46.5% in the IHP group versus 29.5% in the control group (P=0.12). Median OS was 21.7 months for IHP and 17.6 months for BAC (HR 0.64, 95% CI 0.37–1.10). Median progression-free survival was 7.4 months for IHP and 3.3 months for BAC (HR 0.21, 95% CI 0.12–0.36). Severe adverse events occurred in 19.5% of IHP patients and 6.5% of BAC patients. HRQOL was sustained in the IHP group but declined in the control group.\n\nInterpretation: IHP offers high response rates and improved progression-free survival, with a trend towards better HRQOL compared to BAC. However, the primary endpoint of OS at 24 months was not met. Trial registration: NCT01785316. Funding: Not specified.",
