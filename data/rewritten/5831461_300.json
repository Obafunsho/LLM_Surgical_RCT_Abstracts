While dexmedetomidine sedation in critical care units has been associated with reduced delirium, its intraoperative efficacy is less understood.\n\nMethods: This multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial evaluated the effect of intraoperative dexmedetomidine on postoperative delirium in elderly patients (>68 years) undergoing major elective noncardiac surgery. Participants were randomized to receive dexmedetomidine (0.5 µg/kg/h) or saline placebo during surgery and for 2 hours postoperatively. The primary outcome was the incidence of postoperative delirium, assessed daily. Secondary outcomes included postoperative cognitive decline. Randomization was computer-generated, with allocation concealed via sealed envelopes. Blinding encompassed patients, clinicians, and outcome assessors. Recruitment spanned February 2008 to May 2014.\n\nResults: Of 404 randomized patients (202 to dexmedetomidine, 202 to placebo), 390 completed delirium assessments. The incidence of postoperative delirium was comparable between the dexmedetomidine and placebo groups (12.2% vs 11.4%, P = .94). Adjusted analyses for age and education level showed no significant differences in cognitive performance at 3 and 6 months postoperatively. Adverse events were similarly distributed between groups.\n\nInterpretation: Intraoperative dexmedetomidine does not prevent postoperative delirium, differing from previous findings in intensive care settings. The timing of administration may be critical for efficacy. Trial registration: NCT00561678. Funding: Not specified.",
