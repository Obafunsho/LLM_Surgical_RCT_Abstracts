Previous research indicated HuR's potential as a biomarker, but lacked validation in a clinical trial setting.\n\nMethods: A randomised controlled trial was conducted with 379 PDA patients from the European Study Group of Pancreatic Cancer-3 trial. Participants were randomised to receive either gemcitabine (GEM) or 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) as adjuvant monotherapy. Tissue samples were immunolabeled for cHuR expression, and patients were categorized into high and low cHuR expression groups. The primary outcome was disease-free survival (DFS), measured over a specified timeframe. Randomisation and allocation concealment methods were not detailed, and blinding was not specified.\n\nResults: In the overall cohort, no association was found between cHuR expression and prognosis (DFS, P = 0.44; overall survival, P = 0.41). However, patients with high cHuR expression had significantly greater median DFS with 5-FU compared to GEM (20.1 months, CI: 8.3–36.4 vs 10.9 months, CI: 7.5–14.2; P = 0.04). Median DFS was similar between treatment arms in patients with low cHuR expression. Adverse events were not reported.\n\nInterpretation: High cHuR-expressing tumors may benefit from 5-FU-based adjuvant therapy compared to GEM, while low cHuR expression shows no survival advantage between treatments. Further studies are needed to validate HuR as a biomarker. Trial registration and funding details were not provided.",
