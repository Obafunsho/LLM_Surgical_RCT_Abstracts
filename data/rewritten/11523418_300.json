A 300-word version\n\nBackground: This study aims to evaluate the validation of disease-specific patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) for chronic venous disease (CVD) using a structured three-phase continuum framework.\n\nMethods: A comprehensive literature search was conducted in OVID Embase and Medline to identify relevant English-language studies from January 1, 1993, to June 30, 2022, that utilized disease-specific PROMs for CVD. Studies were screened for eligibility, and data on validation were abstracted. The validation criteria included content validity, reliability (construct validity, internal reliability, and test-retest reliability), responsiveness, and expansion of the validation evidence base. PROMs were categorized into three groups based on disease manifestations: overall CVD (C1 to C6), C1 to C4 disease, and C5 to C6 disease.\n\nResults: Of 2338 unique studies screened, 112 met the inclusion criteria. Eight disease-specific PROMs were identified and categorized. The Chronic Venous Insufficiency Questionnaire (CIVIQ) met validation criteria at all three phases for patients with C1 to C4 disease, and the Charing Cross Venous Ulcer Questionnaire (CCVUQ) met criteria for patients with C5 to C6 disease. No PROMs met all criteria for validation for use in overall CVD (C1 to C6).\n\nInterpretation: Among the eight PROMs assessed, only two met the prespecified criteria for validation across all phases. The CIVIQ and CCVUQ are recommended for use in patients with C1 to C4 disease and C5 to C6 disease, respectively. Further validation work is necessary to improve the implementation of PROMs in clinical practice, including establishing minimal clinically important differences and evaluating predictive validity. This study highlights the need for continued development and validation of PROMs to support patient-centered care in CVD.",
