Participants, ranging from second to seventh year of residency, were randomly assigned to two groups. Group 1 received in-person feedback first, followed by remote feedback, while Group 2 received remote feedback first, followed by in-person feedback. The primary outcome was the effectiveness of remote feedback, assessed through interviews and a validated questionnaire post-training.\n\nResults: No significant difference was found between remote and in-person feedback in the questionnaire results. Participants expressed mixed feelings about remote feedback during interviews but reported no limiting factors to practice. Clear communication and shared task understanding were critical for successful remote feedback.\n\nInterpretation: Remote expert feedback is a viable method for endovascular skills training, offering increased practice opportunities for vascular surgery residents. The study highlights the importance of effective communication in remote learning environments.\n\nTrial registration: Not provided.\n\nFunding: Not specified.",
