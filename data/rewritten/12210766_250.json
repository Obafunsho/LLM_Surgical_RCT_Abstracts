A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Individualized PEEP in Thoracoscopic Lobectomy\n\nBackground: This study evaluates whether titrating positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) to maximum dynamic lung compliance reduces postoperative pulmonary complications (PPCs) in patients undergoing video-assisted thoracoscopic lobectomy.\n\nMethods: In this single-center, randomized controlled trial, 100 patients scheduled for thoracoscopic lobectomy were randomized to receive either individualized PEEP guided by maximum dynamic pulmonary compliance or a fixed PEEP of 5 cm H2O. The primary outcome was the incidence of PPCs within seven days post-surgery, defined by the European Perioperative Clinical Outcome criteria. Secondary outcomes included PEEP, Cdyn, PaO2, serum concentrations of IL-6 and TNF-α, and length of hospital stay. Randomization was achieved using SPSS-generated sequences with allocation concealment via sealed envelopes. Patients, data managers, and statistical analysts were blinded.\n\nResults: Between October 2022 and October 2023, 100 patients were randomized: 50 to the individualized PEEP group and 50 to the control group. Analysis included all participants. PPCs occurred in 20% of the individualized group versus 38% in the control group (risk difference, -18.0%; 95% CI, -35.4% to -0.6%; p = 0.047). Serum IL-10 was higher and IL-1β lower in the individualized group (p < 0.05).\n\nInterpretation: Individualized PEEP based on dynamic compliance significantly reduces PPCs compared to fixed PEEP. No severe adverse events were reported. \n\nTrial registration: ChiCTR2100048201.\n\nFunding: Not specified.",
