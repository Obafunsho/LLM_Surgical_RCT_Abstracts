A 300-word version\n\nTitle: A Randomised Controlled Trial of Continuous Femoral Nerve Block Duration After Total Knee Arthroplasty\n\nBackground: This randomised controlled trial evaluated whether extending a continuous femoral nerve block (cFNB) to 4 days postoperatively enhances recovery compared to an overnight cFNB in patients undergoing tricompartment total knee arthroplasty.\n\nMethods: Fifty patients were recruited and received a preoperative cFNB with perineural ropivacaine 0.2% until the morning after surgery. Participants were randomly assigned to continue ropivacaine or switch to normal saline. The primary outcomes were the time to achieve three discharge criteria (adequate analgesia, independence from intravenous analgesics, and ambulation of at least 30 m) and ambulatory distance in 6 minutes the afternoon after surgery. Randomisation was computer-generated, and allocation was concealed. Blinding included patients, clinicians, and outcome assessors. \n\nResults: Twenty-five patients were randomised to each group. The 4-day ropivacaine group met discharge criteria in a median of 25 hours (25th–75th percentiles: 21–47) compared to 71 hours (46–89) in the control group (estimated ratio, 0.47; 95% CI, 0.32–0.67; P < 0.001). Ambulation distance was 32 m (17–47) for the ropivacaine group versus 26 m (13–35) for the control (estimated ratio, 1.21; 95% CI, 0.71–1.85; P = 0.42). No significant adverse events were reported, with no differences in frequency or severity between groups.\n\nInterpretation: Extending cFNB to 4 days postoperatively significantly reduced the time to meet discharge criteria but did not enhance ambulation distance. This suggests that while prolonged cFNB may expedite readiness for discharge, it does not necessarily improve early postoperative mobility. Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov No. NCT00135889.
