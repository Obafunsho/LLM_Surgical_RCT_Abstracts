A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Epiaortic Ultrasound in Surgical Aortic Valve Replacement\n\nBackground: This study investigates the association between epiaortic ultrasound-based atheroma grade and perioperative adverse outcomes in surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR).\n\nMethods: In a randomised controlled trial, SAVR patients were assigned to two embolic protection devices. A protocol-defined 5-view epiaortic ultrasound was performed, and aortic atherosclerosis was quantified using Katz atheroma grade. Patients were categorized into mild (grade I-II) versus moderate/severe (grade III-V) atheroma grades. Multivariable logistic regression estimated associations between atheroma grade and adverse outcomes, including death, stroke, cerebral infarction on DW-MRI, delirium, and acute kidney injury (AKI) by 7 and 30 days.\n\nResults: Of 383 randomised patients, 326 (85.1%) had pre-cannulation epiaortic ultrasound data. Moderate/severe atheroma grade was found in 106 (32.5%) patients. No significant differences were observed in the composite of death, stroke, or cerebral infarction on DW-MRI by 7 days. However, moderate/severe atheroma grade was associated with a greater risk of AKI by 7 days (adjusted OR: 2.63; 95% CI: 1.24–5.58; p=0.01). At 30 days, these patients had a greater risk of death, stroke, or AKI (adjusted OR: 1.97; 95% CI: 1.04–3.71; p=0.04).\n\nInterpretation: Moderate/severe aortic atherosclerosis is associated with increased adverse events following SAVR. Epiaortic ultrasound may help identify patients who could benefit from strategies to reduce atheroembolic complications.\n\nTrial registration: [Trial registration number]\n\nFunding: [Source of funding]",
