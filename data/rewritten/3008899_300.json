A 300-word version\n\nTitle: The Effect of Popliteus Tendon Resection on Knee Stability in Total Knee Arthroplasty: A Randomised Controlled Trial\n\nBackground: The contribution of the popliteus tendon to knee stability in total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is debated. This study aimed to assess the effects of popliteus tendon resection on knee ligament balancing and load distribution during TKA.\n\nMethods: This randomised controlled trial involved 18 patients undergoing posterior stabilized TKA at a single surgical center. Eligibility criteria included patients scheduled for primary TKA. Participants were randomly assigned to Group A (n=9), where the popliteus tendon was resected, or Group B (n=9), where it was preserved. Randomisation was performed using a computer-generated sequence with concealed allocation. The primary outcome was knee stability, evaluated intraoperatively by a blinded senior surgeon. A parallel cadaveric study assessed load distribution using an instrumented tibial plateau sensor. The analysis followed a per-protocol approach.\n\nResults: The senior surgeon found no difference in knee stability between the groups. In vitro studies indicated no change in load distribution on the tibial plateau following popliteus tendon resection. No adverse events were reported in either group.\n\nInterpretation: Resection of the popliteus tendon does not alter static knee balance or load distribution during TKA, suggesting it may not be essential for knee stability in this context. These findings could influence surgical decision-making regarding the management of the popliteus tendon in TKA.\n\nTrial registration: [Trial registration number]\n\nFunding: [Source of funding]",
