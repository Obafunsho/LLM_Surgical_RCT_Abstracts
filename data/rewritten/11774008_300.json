A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Educational Interventions for Vascular Access Self-Management in Haemodialysis\n\nBackground: Effective self-management of vascular access is crucial for reducing complications in haemodialysis patients. This study assesses the effectiveness of educational interventions aimed at improving self-management of long-term vascular access in adults receiving haemodialysis.\n\nMethods: This systematic review included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasiexperimental studies. Participants were adults with kidney failure requiring long-term haemodialysis. Interventions involved patient education, predominantly provided by nurses, using resources like booklets, practical demonstrations, and videos. The primary outcome was improvement in vascular access self-management behaviours, measured over varying timeframes. Randomisation methods and allocation concealment were not consistently reported. Blinding details were not specified.\n\nResults: Seven studies with 540 participants were included: two RCTs and five quasiexperimental. Education significantly improved self-management behaviours. However, there was inconsistency in outcome measures and insufficient evidence on the optimal delivery and duration of interventions. No adverse events were reported. The studies varied in design, delivery, intensity, and instruments used to measure outcomes, preventing a meta-analysis. Improvements in self-management behaviours were generalised, making it difficult to ascertain specific behaviours needing attention.\n\nInterpretation: Educational interventions led to improvements in self-management behaviours in adults with long-term haemodialysis vascular access. Given the significance of a functioning vascular access for haemodialysis, education should be an integral part of ongoing care. Further research is needed to develop evidence-based, nurse-led interventions. Trial registration: PROSPERO CRD42023414193. Funding: Not specified.",
