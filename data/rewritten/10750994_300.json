A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Reoperation Techniques for Mitral Valve Repair Failure\n\nBackground: Recurrent prolapse after mitral valve repair is a significant issue, necessitating effective reoperation strategies. This study assesses the outcomes of different reoperation techniques for mitral valve repair failure.\n\nMethods: Conducted at Cleveland Clinic, this retrospective study involved 11 patients with moderately severe or severe mitral regurgitation due to recurrent prolapse after initial posterior leaflet repair with artificial chordae and annuloplasty, from January 1, 2008, to January 31, 2023. The primary outcome was the degree of mitral regurgitation post-reoperation, evaluated by echocardiogram at discharge and follow-up (median 20 months). \n\nResults: Of the 11 patients, 10 underwent mitral valve re-repair, and one had valve replacement. Re-repair techniques included creation of new, shorter artificial chordae (n=5), posterior leaflet resection (n=5), and placement of a new annuloplasty (n=8). All patients left the operating room with no or trace mitral regurgitation, confirmed on predischarge echocardiogram. At last follow-up, all patients had mild MR or less. There was no operative mortality or major complications.\n\nInterpretation: The study demonstrates that re-repair techniques, such as leaflet resection and creation of shorter artificial chordae, are effective in managing mitral valve repair failure due to recurrent prolapse, with excellent midterm outcomes. These findings suggest that careful evaluation of mitral regurgitation mechanisms is crucial for successful and durable repair. Further research is needed to better understand the underlying mechanisms and ventricular segments involved in reverse remodeling.\n\nTrial registration: IRB# 23-844.\n\nFunding: Not specified.",
