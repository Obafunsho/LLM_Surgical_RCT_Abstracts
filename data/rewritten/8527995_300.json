A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of EC-IC Bypass in AICAO Patients\n\nBackground: There is a paucity of data on the outcomes of extracranial-intracranial (EC-IC) bypass in patients with recurrent hemispheric syndromes due to atherosclerotic internal carotid artery occlusion (AICAO).\n\nMethods: This randomised controlled trial was conducted within the Carotid Occlusion Surgery Study (COSS) framework. Participants with recurrent hemispheric ischemia (rHEMI+) and without (rHEMI−) were randomised to receive either EC-IC bypass surgery or medical management. The primary outcome was the incidence of all stroke and death from randomisation through 30 days and ipsilateral ischemic stroke within 2 years. Randomisation was computer-generated, and allocation was concealed. Due to the nature of the intervention, blinding was not feasible.\n\nResults: A total of 195 participants were randomised, with 100 identified as rHEMI+ (50 in each group). Baseline characteristics were comparable except for a higher incidence of previous stroke (61% vs 20%, P < .01) and TIA as the entry event (59% vs 21%, P < .01) in rHEMI+. No significant differences in the primary endpoint were found between surgical and nonsurgical groups in rHEMI+ (26.3% vs 22.4%, P = .660) and rHEMI− (18.9% vs 19.5%, P = .943). The analysis was conducted on an intention-to-treat basis. Adverse events were not reported.\n\nInterpretation: The study found no benefit of EC-IC bypass over medical treatment in patients with recurrent hemispheric stroke syndromes. Emphasis should be placed on early aggressive risk factor management to reduce recurrent strokes. Trial registration: [Trial registration number]. Funding: [Source of funding].",
