A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial on the Effects of Unloader Knee Braces on Tibiofemoral Joint Loading\n\nBackground: Unloader knee braces are often used post-tibiofemoral articular cartilage repair, but their efficacy in patients with normal knee alignment is unclear. This study aimed to investigate the effects of varus and valgus adjustments on knee joint loading and muscle activation.\n\nMethods: This randomised controlled trial involved 20 healthy participants (mean age 28.3 years; BMI 22.9 kg/m²) with normal knee alignment. Participants were randomly assigned to varus, valgus, or no brace conditions. The primary outcome was the knee adduction moment, measured during gait analysis. Randomisation was computer-generated, and allocation was concealed. Blinding was applied to outcome assessors.\n\nResults: No significant differences were found between braced and non-braced conditions in kinetic or muscle activity parameters. Varus bracing increased knee adduction moments and produced a more laterally directed muscular activation profile. Valgus bracing also increased knee adduction moments but resulted in a similar lateral activation profile. Effect sizes were moderate to large, indicating potential for future research.\n\nInterpretation: The study revealed inconsistencies in knee kinetics and muscle activation with varus and valgus bracing. Despite non-significant results, the effect sizes suggest that unloader bracing may not be effective for individuals with normally aligned knees post-cartilage repair. No adverse events were reported.\n\nTrial registration: [Trial registration number]\n\nFunding: [Source of funding]",
