This study aimed to investigate this mechanism.\n\nMethods: This randomised controlled trial involved 16 patients with advanced idiopathic Parkinson's disease, recruited from multiple surgical centers. Eligibility required evidence of pathological synchrony in the subthalamic region. Bilateral STN DBS electrodes were implanted, and recordings were made during stimulation using a custom amplifier. The primary outcome was the suppression of local field potential (LFP) activity in the 11–30 Hz range, measured over a few days post-implantation. Randomisation and allocation concealment methods were not specified. Blinding was not implemented for clinical assessments.\n\nResults: DBS progressively suppressed LFP peaks between 11 and 30 Hz as voltage increased beyond 1.5 V, with median peak power reduced to 54% of baseline at 3.0 V. No adverse events were reported.\n\nInterpretation: DBS can suppress pathological 11–30 Hz activity at clinically effective voltages, suggesting a potential mechanism for its therapeutic effects in Parkinson's disease.\n\nTrial registration: Not provided.\n\nFunding: Not specified.",
