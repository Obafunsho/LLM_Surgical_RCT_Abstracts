A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Patient-Specific Instrumentation in Total Knee Arthroplasty\n\nBackground: This randomised controlled trial investigated whether patient-specific instrumentation (PSI) in total knee arthroplasty (TKA) enhances patient-reported outcomes and gait compared to conventional instrumentation.\n\nMethods: Forty patients scheduled for primary TKA were randomised into two groups: PSI and conventional instrumentation, at a single orthopedic center. Eligibility criteria included adults with knee osteoarthritis. Randomisation was conducted using a computer-generated sequence, with allocation concealment via sealed envelopes. Outcome assessors were blinded. The primary outcome was walking speed, assessed using a 3-D gait analysis system, with a clinically important difference of 0.1 m/second. Secondary outcomes included the New Knee Society Score (KSS), Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), and SF-12, evaluated preoperatively and 3 months postoperatively. The study was powered at 90% to detect differences in walking speed and at 80% for KSS.\n\nResults: All 40 patients completed the study and were analyzed using an intention-to-treat approach. Both groups demonstrated improvements in functional scores, quality of life, and gait parameters from preoperative to 3 months postoperative. However, no significant differences were observed between the PSI and conventional groups in KSS, KOOS, SF-12, or gait parameters. No adverse events were reported in either group.\n\nInterpretation: PSI does not confer a significant advantage in early functional or gait outcomes after TKA. While early outcomes are crucial for patient satisfaction and surgical success, further research is necessary to evaluate potential long-term benefits. Trial registration: [Registration number].
