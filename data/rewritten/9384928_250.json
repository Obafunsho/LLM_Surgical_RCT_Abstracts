A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial Comparing Patellofemoral Arthroplasty and Total Knee Arthroplasty for Isolated Patellofemoral Osteoarthritis\n\nBackground: This randomised controlled trial (RCT) aimed to compare the long-term outcomes of patellofemoral arthroplasty (PFA) versus total knee arthroplasty (TKA) in patients with isolated patellofemoral osteoarthritis (PF-OA).\n\nMethods: We conducted a parallel-group, equivalence RCT with 100 patients, randomised 1:1 to PFA or TKA between 2007 and 2014. Eligibility criteria included debilitating symptoms and isolated PF-OA. The primary outcome was the SF-36 bodily pain score over six years. Randomisation was computer-generated, and allocation was concealed. Blinding was maintained for the first year. Intention-to-treat analysis was used.\n\nResults: Ninety-one patients completed the 6-year follow-up. PFA showed greater improvement in SF-36 bodily pain (mean difference 12, 95% CI 4 to 20; p = 0.004) and other PROs compared to TKA. ROM decreased less in the PFA group at 5 years (mean difference 7°, 95% CI 1° to 13°; p = 0.02). Revision rates at 6 years were similar between groups (PFA: 0.10, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.20; TKA: 0.04, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.12; p = 0.24).\n\nInterpretation: PFA provided better quality of life and ROM over six years compared to TKA, with no significant difference in revision rates. These findings suggest PFA is a preferable option for severe isolated PF-OA, though long-term studies are needed to confirm these results.\n\nTrial registration: [Trial registration number]\n\nFunding: [Source of funding]",
