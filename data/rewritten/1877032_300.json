A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Fibrin Glue Sealant in Liver Resection\n\nBackground: Fibrin sealants are increasingly used to improve perioperative hemostasis and reduce biliary leakage in liver surgery, yet robust evidence from randomised controlled trials is scarce.\n\nMethods: In this randomised controlled trial, 300 patients undergoing hepatic resection were randomly assigned to receive either fibrin glue application or standard care (control). The primary outcome was intraoperative blood loss. Secondary outcomes included transfusion requirements, biliary fistula incidence, and postoperative complications. Randomisation was achieved using a computer-generated sequence, with allocation concealment via sealed envelopes. Outcome assessors were blinded to group assignments.\n\nResults: A total of 150 patients were allocated to each group, with analysis conducted on an intention-to-treat basis. No significant differences were found in transfusion requirements (0.15 ± 0.66 vs. 0.17 ± 0.63 PRCU; P = 0.7234) or in the proportion of patients requiring transfusion (18% vs. 12%; P = 0.2). Overall drainage volumes (1180 ± 2528 vs. 960 ± 1253 mL) and duration of postoperative drainage (7.9 ± 5 vs. 7.1 ± 4.7 days) were similar between groups. The incidence of biliary fistula was comparable (10% vs. 11%), as was postoperative morbidity (23% vs. 23%; P = 1). No significant adverse events were reported in either group.\n\nInterpretation: The application of fibrin sealant in liver resection does not significantly impact blood loss, transfusion needs, or biliary fistula incidence compared to standard care. The findings suggest that routine use of fibrin sealant is not warranted, and its discontinuation could result in substantial cost savings.\n\nTrial registration: [Trial registration number]\n\nFunding: [Source of funding]",
