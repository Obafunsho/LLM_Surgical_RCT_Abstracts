A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Intrathecal Oxytocin for Postoperative Recovery: A Randomised Controlled Trial\n\nBackground: Oxytocin may expedite recovery from surgery by acting on the spinal cord, particularly in the postpartum period. This trial assessed whether intrathecal oxytocin accelerates recovery from pain and disability following major surgery.\n\nMethods: This randomised controlled trial involved 98 participants undergoing elective total hip arthroplasty, randomised to receive intrathecal oxytocin (100 μg) or saline. The primary outcome was the modelled pain trajectory from hospital discharge over 8 weeks. Secondary outcomes included opioid use, daily steps, and disability. Randomisation was computer-generated with concealed allocation. Blinding was maintained for participants, clinicians, and outcome assessors. The study was conducted at a single tertiary care center.\n\nResults: Ninety patients were analysed (oxytocin: n=44; saline: n=46) using an intention-to-treat approach. The primary outcome showed no significant difference in pain trajectory between groups (intercept: −0.1, 95% CI: −0.8 to 0.6, p=0.746; slope: 0.1, 95% CI: 0 to 0.2, p=0.057). Secondary analyses revealed that the oxytocin group ceased opioid use earlier and walked nearly 1000 more steps daily at 8 weeks (p<0.001), with a clinically meaningful reduction in disability for the first 21 postoperative days (p=0.007). No study drug-related adverse effects were observed.\n\nInterpretation: While intrathecal oxytocin did not significantly impact pain recovery, it may enhance functional recovery post-surgery. These findings suggest further investigation into intrathecal oxytocin for postoperative recovery is warranted.\n\nTrial registration: [Trial registration number]\n\nFunding: The study was terminated early due to lack of funding.",
