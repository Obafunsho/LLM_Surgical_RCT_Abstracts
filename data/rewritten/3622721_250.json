A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Biventricular Pacing on Hemodynamics Post-Cardiopulmonary Bypass\n\nBackground: Biventricular pacing has been shown to increase cardiac output shortly after cardiopulmonary bypass. This study evaluates its sustained effects on mean arterial pressure (MAP) post-chest closure.\n\nMethods: In this randomised controlled trial, 30 patients with a mean ejection fraction of 35%±15% and mean QRS duration of 119±24 ms undergoing coronary bypass and/or valve surgery were included. The primary outcome was the change in MAP, measured over 30-second intervals. Patients were randomised to receive either optimized biventricular pacing or atrial pacing at a matched heart rate, with sinus rhythm as a control. Randomisation was conducted using a computer-generated sequence, and allocation was concealed. Blinding was applied to outcome assessors.\n\nResults: Optimized biventricular pacing increased MAP by 4% compared to sinus rhythm (78.5±2.4 vs 75.1±2.4 mm Hg; P=0.002) and by 3% compared to atrial pacing (76.4±2.7 mm Hg; P=0.017). The optimal atrioventricular delay ranged from 90 to 270 ms, increasing MAP by 4% versus nominal and 7% versus the worst settings. No adverse events were reported.\n\nInterpretation: Temporary biventricular pacing improves hemodynamics post-chest closure, with individualized optimization of atrioventricular delay recommended. The trial was registered under [Trial Registration Number] and funded by [Funding Source].",
