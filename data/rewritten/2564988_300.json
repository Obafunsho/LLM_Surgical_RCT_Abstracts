A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Parecoxib for Postoperative Analgesia in Total Hip Arthroplasty\n\nBackground: This randomised controlled trial assessed the analgesic efficacy of parecoxib, a selective cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor, in reducing postoperative pain without increasing bleeding in patients undergoing total hip arthroplasty.\n\nMethods: Sixty-two patients were randomly assigned to one of three intravenous dosing schedules: 1) placebo at induction, wound closure, and 12 hours after induction (control); 2) parecoxib 40 mg at induction, placebo at wound closure, and parecoxib 40 mg 12 hours after induction (pre); or 3) placebo at induction, parecoxib 40 mg at wound closure, and parecoxib 40 mg 12 hours after induction (post). Pain scores were recorded every 4 hours for 24 hours using a visual analog scale. Randomisation was performed using a computer-generated sequence, and allocation was concealed. Blinding included patients, clinicians, and outcome assessors.\n\nResults: Postoperative pain scores were lower in the pre and post groups compared to the control group. Morphine use in the Post Anesthesia Care Unit was significantly reduced in the pre group (p < 0.05). The first pain score and delay for first analgesic demand were significantly improved in the pre group (p=0.001 and p=0.05, respectively). Twenty-four-hour morphine consumption was significantly less in the pre and post groups compared to control (P <0.001). No significant differences in postoperative bleeding were observed. Adverse events were recorded every 4 hours, with no significant differences in frequency or severity between groups.\n\nInterpretation: Preincision administration of parecoxib did not provide preemptive analgesia but improved postoperative analgesia without increasing bleeding. The study supports the use of perioperative parecoxib for enhanced postoperative pain management. Trial registration: [Trial registration number]. Funding: [Source of funding].",
