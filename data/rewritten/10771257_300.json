A 300-word version\n\nTitle: EAGLE: A Randomised Controlled Trial to Reduce Anastomotic Leaks after Right Colectomy\n\nBackground: Anastomotic leak affects 8% of patients following right colectomy, leading to a 10-fold increase in postoperative mortality. This trial aimed to assess whether a standardized international quality improvement intervention could reduce anastomotic leak rates.\n\nMethods: This international, multicentre, batched, cluster-randomized trial used hospital teams as the unit of randomization. The intervention comprised an online educational module, risk stratification, an intraoperative checklist, and harmonized surgical techniques. Clusters were randomized using a stepped-wedge design. The primary outcome was the anastomotic leak rate within 30 days post-surgery. Patients were blinded to allocation. The study was conducted in 332 hospital teams across 64 countries, with 39.2% from low- and middle-income countries. The sample size was calculated to detect a 30% reduction in leak rates.\n\nResults: A total of 355 hospital teams registered, with 332 included in the final analysis. Of 4411 surgeons, 2143 completed the modules. The primary analysis included 3039 of 3268 patients, with leak rates of 10.1% before and 9.6% after intervention (adjusted OR 0.87, 95% CI 0.59 to 1.30; P = 0.498). High-engagement centres showed a decrease from 12.2% to 5.1% (adjusted OR 0.36, 95% CI 0.20 to 0.64; P < 0.001). No adverse events were reported.\n\nInterpretation: Completion of globally available digital training by engaged teams can significantly reduce anastomotic leak rates. The trial was registered under NCT04270721 and funded with Euros 460,000. The findings suggest that digital training interventions can be effective in improving surgical outcomes, particularly in high-engagement settings.",
