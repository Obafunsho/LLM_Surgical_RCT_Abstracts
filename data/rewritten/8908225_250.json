A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Hyperthermic Intraperitoneal Chemotherapy in Advanced Ovarian Cancer\n\nBackground: Ovarian cancer has the highest mortality rate among gynecologic malignancies. This study evaluates the clinical benefit of hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) following primary or interval cytoreductive surgery in women with stage III or IV ovarian cancer.\n\nMethods: This single-blind randomised controlled trial was conducted at two institutions in South Korea from March 2, 2010, to January 22, 2016. A total of 184 patients with stage III or IV ovarian cancer and residual tumor size less than 1 cm were randomised (1:1) to receive HIPEC (41.5 °C, 75 mg/m² of cisplatin, 90 minutes) or standard care. The primary outcome was progression-free survival, measured from randomisation to disease progression or death. Randomisation was performed intraoperatively, and participants were blinded to group allocation. An intention-to-treat analysis was conducted.\n\nResults: Of the 184 women randomised, 92 were assigned to each group. Median progression-free survival was 19.8 months in the HIPEC group and 18.8 months in the control group (P = .43). Median overall survival was 69.5 months in the HIPEC group and 61.3 months in the control group (P = .52). In the interval cytoreductive surgery subgroup, HIPEC improved progression-free survival (HR, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.37-0.99; P = .04) and overall survival (HR, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.29-0.96; P = .04).\n\nInterpretation: HIPEC did not significantly improve survival outcomes overall but showed benefits in the interval cytoreductive surgery subgroup. Adverse events were more frequent in the HIPEC group. Trial Registration: NCT01091636. Funding: Not specified.",
