  "abstract": "Title: Randomised Controlled Trial of Epidural Dexmedetomidine in Low-Concentration PCEA for Total Knee Arthroplasty\n\n250-word version\n\nBackground: This randomised controlled trial evaluated the impact of adding epidural dexmedetomidine to low-concentration patient-controlled epidural analgesia (PCEA) on pain control and side effects in total knee arthroplasty (TKA).\n\nMethods: Sixty patients with American Society of Anesthesiologists grade I to II undergoing TKA were randomly assigned to receive either 0.125% bupivacaine + fentanyl 4 µg/mL (group R) or 0.1% bupivacaine + fentanyl 2 µg/mL with an epidural injection of dexmedetomidine 1 µg/kg (group D). Randomisation was achieved through concealed envelopes, and the study was double-blind. The primary outcome was postoperative pain control measured by the numeric pain rating scale (NRS) over 48 hours. Secondary outcomes included hemodynamic parameters, motor block assessment, sensory block duration, and analgesia duration.\n\nResults: Fifty-five patients were analysed per protocol (group R: n = 27, group D: n = 28). Both groups achieved similar pain control (NRS scores, p > 0.05). Group D had lower rates of urinary retention (28.6% vs. 59.3%, p = 0.022) and pruritus, while sedation was higher in group D in the recovery room. Group R had higher systolic pressure in the recovery room. No significant differences were found in sensory block duration or analgesia duration.\n\nInterpretation: Low-concentration PCEA with epidural dexmedetomidine provides similar analgesia after TKA as high-concentration PCEA with fewer side effects.
