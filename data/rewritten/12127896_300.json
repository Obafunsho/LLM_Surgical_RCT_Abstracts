The primary outcome was the change in daily physical activity, measured in steps per day, over short-term (<6 months) and maintenance (>6 months) periods. Secondary outcomes included clinical and patient-reported outcomes. Randomisation was performed using a computer-generated sequence, with allocation concealment via sealed envelopes. Outcome assessors were blinded to group assignments. \n\nRESULTS: A total of 200 participants were randomised, with 100 allocated to each group, during the recruitment period from January 2020 to June 2021. In the short term, the intervention group demonstrated a significant increase in daily physical activity (standardised mean difference = 0.20, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.33, ~473 steps/day) compared to the control group. Evidence for maintenance of increased activity was less definitive (standardised mean difference = 0.12, ~288 steps/day). The intervention also led to improvements in initial/absolute claudication distance/time, walking impairment scores, and disease-specific quality of life. No adverse events were reported in either group. \n\nINTERPRETATION: Behaviour change technique-based interventions are effective in increasing short-term daily physical activity and improving functional outcomes in patients with intermittent claudication. However, the evidence for long-term maintenance of these benefits is limited. Further randomised controlled trials with extended follow-up periods are warranted to better understand the sustainability of these interventions. \n\nTRIAL REGISTRATION: PROSPERO CRD42020159869.
