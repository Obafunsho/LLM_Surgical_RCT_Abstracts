A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Systemic Opioid Analgesics in Neonates Post-Surgery\n\nBackground: Effective postoperative pain management is crucial for neonates undergoing surgery for congenital malformations or complications of prematurity. This study assesses the benefits and harms of systemic opioid analgesics compared to placebo, non-pharmacological interventions, different opioids, or other drugs.\n\nMethods: We conducted a randomised controlled trial involving preterm and term infants up to 46 weeks postmenstrual age with postoperative pain. Participants were randomised to receive opioids or comparators. Randomisation was computer-generated, with allocation concealment via sealed envelopes. Blinding included outcome assessors, patients, and clinicians. The primary outcome was pain, assessed using validated methods during initial hospitalisation. Secondary outcomes included all-cause mortality and major neurodevelopmental disability.\n\nResults: Four RCTs with 331 infants were included. Two trials compared opioids with placebo, one compared fentanyl with tramadol, and one compared morphine with paracetamol. No meta-analyses were performed due to limited outcome data. The evidence was very uncertain for all outcomes, including pain and all-cause mortality. For tramadol vs. placebo, RR for mortality was 0.32 (95% CI 0.01 to 7.70). For fentanyl vs. tramadol, RR was 0.99 (95% CI 0.59 to 1.64). For morphine vs. paracetamol, MD in pain scores was 0.10 (95% CI -0.85 to 1.05). No adverse events were reported.\n\nInterpretation: The study provides limited evidence on the efficacy and safety of opioids for neonatal postoperative pain. The findings are inconclusive due to imprecision and study limitations. Further research is needed to determine the optimal pain management strategy in this population.\n\nTrial registration: [Provide registration number]\n\nFunding: [Provide funding source]",
