  "abstract": "1. A 250-word version\n\nBACKGROUND: Pilonidal disease management lacks consensus, with varied surgical practices. This study aimed to evaluate the relationship between disease severity and intervention, patient-valued outcomes, and treatment preferences to inform policy and future research.\n\nMETHODS: This prospective cohort study was conducted across 31 National Health Service trusts, involving patients aged >16 years referred for elective surgical treatment of pilonidal disease. The primary outcome was postoperative pain on days 1 and 7, with secondary outcomes including time to healing, return to normal activities, complications, and recurrence. Outcomes were compared between major and minor procedures using regression modeling and propensity score-based approaches. \n\nRESULTS: A total of 667 patients were included, with 60% undergoing major procedures. Major procedures resulted in greater pain on day 1 (mean difference 1.58 points, 95% CI 1.14 to 2.01) and day 7 (mean difference 1.53 points, 95% CI 1.12 to 1.95), higher complication rates (adjusted risk difference 17.5%, 95% CI 9.1 to 25.9%), lower recurrence (adjusted risk difference -10.1%, 95% CI -18.1 to -2.1%), and longer recovery times. Patient decision-making was influenced by disease experience and recovery expectations. \n\nINTERPRETATION: The burden of pilonidal surgery is significant, suggesting the need for better intervention selection based on disease type and patient goals. Future trials should stratify disease and utilize broad intervention groupings. \n\nTRIAL REGISTRATION: ISRCTN95551898.
