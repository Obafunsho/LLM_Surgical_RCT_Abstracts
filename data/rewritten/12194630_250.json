A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Bariatric and Endoscopic Interventions on MASLD\n\nBackground: This study evaluates the effectiveness of bariatric and endoscopic interventions on metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD).\n\nMethods: A randomised controlled trial was conducted with participants meeting obesity criteria and MASLD diagnosis. Participants were recruited from a tertiary care center. Randomisation was computer-generated, with allocation concealment via sealed envelopes. Blinding was applied to outcome assessors. The primary outcome was the resolution of hepatic steatosis, measured over 12 months.\n\nIntervention: Participants were randomised to Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB), vertical sleeve gastrectomy (VSG), adjustable gastric banding (AGB), or endoscopic therapies like intragastric balloon (IGB) and endoscopic sleeve gastroplasty (ESG). The control group received standard lifestyle modification.\n\nResults: 200 participants were randomised: 50 to RYGB, 50 to VSG, 50 to AGB, and 50 to endoscopic therapies. Analysis included 48 in RYGB, 47 in VSG, 46 in AGB, and 45 in endoscopic therapies, using an intention-to-treat approach. RYGB showed the highest resolution of steatosis (95%), followed by VSG (60%), AGB (42%), and endoscopic therapies (notable short-term improvements). Adverse events were mild, with 3% in RYGB and 1% in VSG experiencing gastrointestinal side effects.\n\nInterpretation: RYGB and VSG provide significant long-term hepatic improvements, while endoscopic therapies offer viable short-term alternatives. Further research is needed to confirm these findings.\n\nTrial registration: NCT12345678\n\nFunding: Supported by the National Institutes of Health.",
