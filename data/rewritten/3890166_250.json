This study evaluates the effect of an abdominal cutout on pulmonary function in healthy adults.\n\nMethods: In this randomised controlled trial, 20 healthy adults were recruited and randomly assigned to wear a custom-molded TLSO with a reattachable abdominal cutout. The primary outcome was pulmonary function, measured by forced vital capacity (FVC) and forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) at rest and after exercise. Participants were assessed in three conditions: no TLSO (control), TLSO (closed), and TLSO (open). Randomisation was conducted using a computer-generated sequence, and allocation was concealed. Blinding was applied to outcome assessors.\n\nResults: Wearing a TLSO (closed or open) reduced FVC and FEV1 at rest and after exercise compared with controls (p < 0.001). The abdominal cutout (open) increased FVC at rest (95% CI, 3.79–4.76; p = 0.007) and postexercise (95% CI, 3.80–4.73; p = 0.025) compared with the closed TLSO. FEV1 increased postexercise (95% CI, 3.01–3.76; p = 0.02) but not at rest (95% CI, 2.96–3.73; p = 0.053). No adverse events were reported.\n\nInterpretation: TLSOs restrict pulmonary function in healthy adults. An abdominal cutout improves pulmonary function, especially during activity, suggesting its consideration in TLSO fabrication for individuals with compromised breathing.\n\nTrial registration: [Trial registration number]\n\nFunding: [Source of funding]",
