A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Autologous Osteoblastic Cell Therapy versus Bone Marrow Aspirate Concentrate in Pre-collapse Osteonecrosis of the Femoral Head\n\nBackground: This randomised, single-blind trial assessed whether autologous osteoblastic cell therapy could reduce progression to subchondral fracture and improve pain compared to bone marrow aspirate concentrate (BMAC) in patients with pre-collapse osteonecrosis of the femoral head (ONFH).\n\nMethods: Conducted from 2004 to 2011, the study involved 67 patients with Stage I or II ONFH, excluding those with traumatic ONFH, hemoglobinopathies, or positive serology for hepatitis B, C, or HIV. Participants were randomly assigned to core decompression with either BMAC (n = 26) or osteoblastic cell therapy (n = 30). The primary outcome was the absence of progression to subchondral fracture (ARCO stage III or higher) and a clinically important pain improvement over 36 months. Randomisation was achieved using a computer-generated sequence, with allocation concealment. Outcome assessors were blinded.\n\nResults: At 36 months, no significant differences were found in progression to fracture (46% BMAC vs. 22% osteoblastic cells; hazard ratio, 0.47 [95% CI 0.17 to 1.31]; p = 0.15) or pain scores. No differences were observed in THA rates (15% osteoblastic cells vs. 35% BMAC; p = 0.09) or adverse events. The analysis was conducted as-treated for efficacy and intention-to-treat for adverse events.\n\nInterpretation: Autologous osteoblastic cell therapy did not show superiority over BMAC in preventing progression or improving pain in pre-collapse ONFH. Adverse events were uncommon and mild. These findings suggest that larger, multicenter trials are necessary to establish efficacy before recommending this treatment in routine practice.\n\nTrial registration: Not provided.
