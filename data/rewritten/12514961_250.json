The primary outcome was opioid consumption within 72 hours postoperatively. Secondary outcomes included pain ratings, rescue analgesia, time to first ambulation and defecation, and adverse events. Randomization was performed using fixed block randomization with allocation concealment via sealed opaque envelopes. Participants, clinicians, and outcome assessors were blinded.\n\nResults: Between November 1, 2024, and March 10, 2025, 102 patients were randomized (LB group, n = 51; RH group, n = 51). One patient was excluded, leaving 101 for analysis. LB significantly reduced 72-hour opioid consumption compared to RH (mean difference = –181.4 mg; 95% CI: –232.8, –130.0 mg; P < 0.001). Fewer patients in the LB group required rescue analgesia (OR: 0.33; 95% CI: 0.13, 0.82; P = 0.015). No significant differences in adverse events were observed between groups.\n\nInterpretation: LB in thoracic paravertebral block reduces opioid consumption and enhances recovery without increasing adverse events.
