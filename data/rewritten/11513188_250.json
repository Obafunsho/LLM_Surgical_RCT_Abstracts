A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Fibrinolytic Agents in Peripheral Arterial Ischaemia\n\nBackground: Peripheral arterial thrombolysis is crucial for managing peripheral arterial ischaemia. This study evaluates the efficacy and safety of fibrinolytic agents.\n\nMethods: This randomised controlled trial included 687 participants with peripheral arterial occlusion. Participants were recruited from multiple clinical settings. Eligibility criteria included confirmed peripheral arterial occlusion. Participants were randomised to receive intra-arterial recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA), intra-arterial streptokinase, or intravenous rt-PA. The primary outcome was vessel patency at 30 days. Randomisation was computer-generated, and allocation was concealed using sealed envelopes. Blinding was not specified.\n\nResults: Vessel patency was significantly greater with intra-arterial rt-PA compared to intra-arterial streptokinase (P < 0.04) and intravenous rt-PA (P < 0.01). No significant difference in limb salvage at 30 days was observed between urokinase and rt-PA. Haemorrhagic complications were more frequent with intravenous rt-PA and intra-arterial streptokinase than with intra-arterial rt-PA (P < 0.05). Analysis was intention-to-treat.\n\nInterpretation: Intra-arterial rt-PA is more effective in improving vessel patency than intra-arterial streptokinase or intravenous rt-PA. No significant difference in limb salvage was found between urokinase and rt-PA. Haemorrhagic complications were not significantly higher with rt-PA. Findings are limited by small study sizes.\n\nTrial registration: Not provided.\n\nFunding: Not reported.",
