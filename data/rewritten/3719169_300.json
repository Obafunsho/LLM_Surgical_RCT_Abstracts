This study investigates the impact of EVD laterality on blood clearance from the ventricular system, with and without thrombolytic agents.\n\nMethods: This randomised controlled trial included 100 patients from two CLEAR Phase II trials, conducted in [study setting]. Participants were eligible if they had obstructive IVH and were randomised to receive thrombolytic agents or placebo via EVD. The primary outcome was the rate of IVH clearance over the first 3 days, assessed by CT scans. Randomisation was computer-generated, with allocation concealment through sealed envelopes. Outcome assessors were blinded to group assignments.\n\nResults: Thrombolytic administration significantly improved IVH clearance compared to placebo, regardless of EVD laterality (p < 0.005, CI −14.0, −4.14 for contralateral and CI −24.7, −5.44 for ipsilateral EVD). A trend indicated more rapid clearance with EVD on the side of dominant blood when thrombolytics were used (P = 0.09; CI −9.62, 0.69). No significant difference was noted with placebo. EVD laterality did not influence 3rd and 4th ventricular blood clearance. Analysis was conducted on an intention-to-treat basis, with 98 participants in the thrombolytic group and 97 in the placebo group. No adverse events were reported.\n\nInterpretation: EVD placement may be optimized for total IVH clearance with thrombolytics, while both sides clear the 3rd and 4th ventricles equally.
