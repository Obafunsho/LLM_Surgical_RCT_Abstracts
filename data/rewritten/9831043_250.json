This study investigates the prognostic value of LN size in EC patients.\n\nMethods: In the UK MRC OE02 trial, 802 patients with locally advanced resectable EC were randomised to surgery alone (S) or neoadjuvant chemotherapy plus surgery (C+S) from 1992 to 1998. The primary outcome was 5-year overall survival (OS). LN size was measured in 367 patients (188 S, 179 C+S) using hematoxylin-eosin stained sections. Randomisation was computer-generated, and allocation was concealed. Blinding was applied to outcome assessors.\n\nResults: Large LN size was associated with lower pN category (P = 0.01) and lower lymphatic invasion (P = 0.02) in S patients. (y)pN0 patients with large LNs had the best OS, while (y)pN1 patients had the poorest OS regardless of LN size (P < 0.001). Large LNs had fewer lymphocytes (P = 0.02) and a higher germinal centers/lymphocyte ratio (P = 0.05).\n\nInterpretation: LN size is a potential prognostic marker for (y)pN0 EC patients, indicating a host antitumor immune response. Further studies are needed to confirm these findings and explore underlying mechanisms.\n\nTrial registration: Not provided.\n\nFunding: Not specified.",
