A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Erythrocyte Transfusion Effects on Pulmonary Gas Exchange in Surgical Patients\n\nBackground: Transfusion-related acute lung injury is a leading cause of posttransfusion mortality. This study investigates the hypothesis that erythrocyte transfusion affects pulmonary gas exchange in surgical patients.\n\nMethods: This randomised controlled trial included 91 patients undergoing elective major spine surgery at a single center, with anticipated erythrocyte transfusion. Participants were randomly allocated to receive their first transfusion as cell salvage (CS), washed stored, or unwashed stored erythrocytes. Randomisation was computer-generated, and allocation was not concealed. Clinicians were not blinded. The primary outcome was the change in PaO2/FIO2 ratio, measured 5 minutes before and 30 minutes after transfusion.\n\nResults: Ninety-one patients were randomised: 30 to CS, 31 to washed, and 30 to unwashed erythrocytes. The change in PaO2/FIO2 was not significant in any group (CS: 9 ± 59; washed: 10 ± 26; unwashed: 15 ± 1) and did not differ among groups (P = 0.92). Pulmonary dead space (VD/VT) decreased with CS transfusion (−0.01 ± 0.04; P = 0.034) but did not change with other erythrocytes. The change from before to after erythrocyte transfusion did not differ among groups (−0.01 to +0.01; P = 0.28). No significant adverse events were reported.\n\nInterpretation: Erythrocyte transfusion did not impair gas exchange as assessed by PaO2/FIO2, regardless of plasma content. This trial does not support the hypothesis of transfusion-induced gas-exchange deficits observed in healthy volunteers.\n\nTrial registration: [Trial registration number]\n\nFunding: [Source of funding]",
