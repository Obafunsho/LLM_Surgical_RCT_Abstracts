A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Invasive Hemodynamic Monitoring in Acute Heart Failure: A Randomised Controlled Trial\n\nBackground: This study evaluates the efficacy of invasive hemodynamic monitoring in managing acute heart failure (AHF) and cardiogenic shock (CS).\n\nMethods: A randomised controlled trial was conducted with participants recruited from cardiac intensive care units. Eligible participants were adults diagnosed with AHF or CS. Participants were randomised using a computer-generated sequence and allocation was concealed using sealed envelopes. The intervention group received complete hemodynamic assessment, while the control group received standard care. Blinding was applied to outcome assessors.\n\nResults: A total of 200 participants were randomised: 100 to the intervention group and 100 to the control group. The primary outcome was the change in hemodynamic stability, measured over a 30-day period. In the intervention group, 98 participants were analysed using an intention-to-treat approach, showing a significant improvement in hemodynamic stability (mean difference = 5.2 mm Hg, 95% CI 3.1 to 7.3; p = 0.01). Adverse events were reported in 3% of the intervention group and 1% of the control group, with mild gastrointestinal side-effects.\n\nInterpretation: Invasive hemodynamic monitoring significantly improves hemodynamic stability in AHF and CS patients. The study supports its use in clinical practice for better management of these conditions.\n\nTrial registration: NCT12345678\n\nFunding: This trial was funded by the National Heart Institute.",
