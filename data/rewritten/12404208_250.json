A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Effects of Dexmedetomidine on Postoperative Recovery in Elderly TKA Patients: A Randomised Controlled Trial\n\nBackground: This study aimed to evaluate the effects of different doses of dexmedetomidine on postoperative quality of recovery (QoR) in elderly patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty (TKA) and to explore the correlation with electroencephalogram (EEG) changes.\n\nMethods: In this single-center, randomised controlled trial, 225 patients aged 60 years or older undergoing elective TKA were enrolled between December 2022 and June 2023. Participants were randomly assigned in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive 0.6 μg/kg/h dexmedetomidine (Group D2), 0.3 μg/kg/h dexmedetomidine (Group D1), or saline (Group N). The primary outcome was the QoR-15 score on postoperative day 1. Randomisation was performed using a computer-generated sequence, and allocation was concealed. Patients, clinicians, and outcome assessors were blinded.\n\nResults: A total of 204 patients were analysed. Group D2 showed a significant improvement in QoR-15 scores on postoperative day 1 compared to Group N (median difference, 6 points; 95% CI, 4 to 8; P < 0.001) and Group D1 (median difference, 4 points; 95% CI, 2 to 5; P = 0.001). No significant differences were observed on postoperative day 3. Adverse events were similar across groups.\n\nInterpretation: A loading dose of dexmedetomidine followed by 0.6 μg/kg/h improved QoR-15 on postoperative day 1, potentially due to increased slow oscillation peak power.
