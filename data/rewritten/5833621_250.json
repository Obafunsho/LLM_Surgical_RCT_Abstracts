A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Adjuvant Radiotherapy Plus Chemotherapy vs Chemotherapy Alone in Locally Advanced Bladder Cancer\n\nBackground: Locoregional failure after radical cystectomy (RC) in locally advanced bladder cancer (LABC) is common despite chemotherapy. This study evaluates if adjuvant radiotherapy (RT) plus chemotherapy improves locoregional recurrence-free survival (LRFS) compared to chemotherapy alone.\n\nMethods: This randomised phase 2 trial enrolled patients from December 2002 to July 2008 at an academic center. Eligible participants were ≤70 years with ≥pT3b, grade 3, or positive nodes, and negative margins post-RC. Randomisation was weighted to speed accrual. Interventions included chemotherapy plus RT (2 cycles of gemcitabine and cisplatin before and after RT) versus chemotherapy alone (4 cycles of gemcitabine and cisplatin). The primary outcome was LRFS over 2 years. Data analysis was intention-to-treat.\n\nResults: 120 patients were randomised: 75 to chemotherapy plus RT and 45 to chemotherapy alone. LRFS was 96% vs 69% (HR, 0.08; 95% CI, 0.02-0.39; P < .01). Disease-free survival was 68% vs 56% (HR, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.27-1.06; P = .07), and overall survival was 71% vs 60% (HR, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.33-1.11; P = .11). RT-associated late grade 3 gastrointestinal adverse effects occurred in 7% of the chemotherapy plus RT group.\n\nInterpretation: Adjuvant chemotherapy plus RT significantly improved LRFS and showed marginal improvements in disease-free survival. Further phase 3 trials are warranted. Trial registration: NCT01734798. Funding: Not specified.",
