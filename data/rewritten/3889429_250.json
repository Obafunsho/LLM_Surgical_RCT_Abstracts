A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Tourniquet Use in Total Knee Arthroplasty\n\nBackground: The use of a tourniquet throughout total knee arthroplasty (TKA) has not demonstrated improved outcomes and may increase complications. This study evaluates the effects of limited tourniquet use during cementation only.\n\nMethods: In this randomised controlled trial, 71 patients (79 knees) undergoing TKA were randomised to either continuous tourniquet use from incision through cementation (operative tourniquet group) or tourniquet use only during cementation (cementation tourniquet group). The study was conducted at a single institution. Eligibility criteria excluded high-risk patients for tourniquet-related complications. Randomisation was performed using a computer-generated sequence with allocation concealment. Blinding was not specified. The primary outcome was surgical time, with secondary outcomes including postoperative pain, knee motion, blood loss, and complications. A power analysis indicated a need for 260 additional cases for statistical significance.\n\nResults: No significant differences were found between groups in surgical time, pain scores, pain medication requirements, range of motion, hemoglobin change, or total blood loss. One major complication, compartment syndrome, occurred in the operative tourniquet group. No other complications were attributed to tourniquet use.\n\nInterpretation: The findings suggest no significant clinical differences between continuous and limited tourniquet use in TKA. Limited use during cementation may reduce risks associated with prolonged tourniquet application. Trial registration and funding details were not provided.",
