A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial on Perioperative Cardiovascular Risk Assessment\n\nBackground: The perioperative period in non-cardiac surgeries presents unique cardiovascular (CV) risks. This study evaluates the effectiveness of a new guideline for perioperative CV risk assessment in reducing complications.\n\nMethods: This randomised controlled trial was conducted in Brazil, with participants recruited from January 2020 to June 2021. Eligible participants were patients undergoing non-cardiac surgeries. The intervention group received the new guideline-based assessment, while the control group received standard care. The primary outcome was the incidence of CV complications within 30 days post-surgery. Randomisation was computer-generated, and allocation was concealed using sealed envelopes. Blinding was applied to outcome assessors, patients, and clinicians.\n\nResults: A total of 200 participants were randomised, with 100 in each group. Analysis was conducted on 98 participants in the intervention group and 97 in the control group using an intention-to-treat approach. The intervention group showed a significant reduction in CV complications (mean difference = 5.2%, 95% CI 3.1 to 7.3; p = 0.01). Adverse events were reported in 3% of the intervention group and 1% of the control group, with mild gastrointestinal side-effects.\n\nInterpretation: The new guideline significantly reduces perioperative CV complications in non-cardiac surgeries, suggesting its potential for broader implementation. The study highlights the importance of structured risk assessment in improving surgical outcomes. Trial registration: NCT12345678. Funding: Supported by the Brazilian Society of Cardiology.",
