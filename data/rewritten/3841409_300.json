A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Oral Choline Supplementation for Pain Management Post-Gynaecological Surgery\n\nBackground: Nicotinic receptor activation with nicotine reduces post-surgical pain. Choline, a selective agonist at α7-type nicotinic receptors, is anti-nociceptive in animal studies without addictive properties. This study evaluates oral choline supplementation with lecithin for pain management after gynaecological surgery.\n\nMethods: In a double-blind, randomised controlled trial, 60 women undergoing open gynaecological surgery were randomly assigned to receive 20 g of lecithin or placebo. The primary outcome was pain report at rest and with movement, measured postoperatively. Secondary outcomes included plasma choline concentration and tumour necrosis factor (TNF) levels. Randomisation was computer-generated, and allocation was concealed. Patients, clinicians, and outcome assessors were blinded.\n\nResults: Sixty participants were randomised: 30 to the intervention and 30 to the control group. A small but statistically significant increase in plasma choline was observed in the intervention group (mean difference = X, 95% CI Y to Z; p = 0.XX). However, there was no significant difference in pain reports between groups (mean difference = A, 95% CI B to C; p = 0.XX). Plasma TNF levels were not reduced. No adverse effects were reported in either group.\n\nInterpretation: Oral lecithin supplementation resulted in slow absorption and a small increase in plasma choline, insufficient to reduce TNF or pain. The absence of an anti-inflammatory effect likely contributed to the lack of efficacy in pain reduction.\n\nTrial registration: [Trial registration number]\n\nFunding: [Source of funding]",
