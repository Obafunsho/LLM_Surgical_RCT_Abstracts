A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of 5-ALA Dosing for Fluorescence-Guided Resection of Malignant Glioma\n\nBackground: This study evaluates the efficacy of different doses of five-aminolevulinic acid (5-ALA) for fluorescence-guided resection of malignant glioma.\n\nMethods: In a double-blind, randomised controlled trial, 21 patients with suspected malignant glioma were enrolled at a single center. Participants aged 18-75 years with a Karnofsky Performance Scale score of ≥70% were randomised to receive 0.2, 2, or 20 mg/kg of 5-ALA. Randomisation was performed using block randomisation with allocation concealment via sealed envelopes. The primary outcome was the surgeon's perception of tumor fluorescence under violet-blue light, measured intraoperatively. Blinding included patients, surgeons, and outcome assessors.\n\nResults: All 21 patients completed the study. The 20 mg/kg group showed the strongest fluorescence in tumor core and margins, correlating with cell density. No fluorescence was observed at 0.2 mg/kg. A 10-fold increase in dose resulted in a 4-fold increase in fluorescence contrast. The positive predictive value of fluorescence was 100%. Adverse events were not reported. \n\nInterpretation: The 20 mg/kg dose of 5-ALA is most effective for fluorescence-guided resection, with no additional benefit from higher doses.
