IOH was defined as at least one fall of mean arterial pressure (MAP) during general anesthesia, categorized into mild (65 to <75 mmHg), moderate (55 to <65 mmHg), severe (45 to <55 mmHg), and very severe (<45 mmHg). Logistic regression analysis was used to identify factors affecting IOH.\n\nResults: Moderate to very severe hypotension occurred in 86.3% of patients for at least 1 to 5 minutes, with 48.5% experiencing severe or very severe hypotension. Significant risk factors for IOH included female gender, vascular surgery, ASA-PS 4 or 5 in emergency surgery, and the combination with epidural block (EDB). The relative risks for IOH in females compared to males were 1.64 for <75 mmHg, 1.50 for <70 mmHg, 1.40 for <65 mmHg, and 1.36 for <60 mmHg. Vascular surgery was a significant factor for hypotension <55 mmHg.\n\nInterpretation: IOH during general anesthesia is frequent in the Japanese population. Female gender, vascular surgery, ASA-PS 4 or 5 in emergency surgery, and the combination with EDB are independent risk factors associated with IOH. The study did not elucidate the association with patient outcomes.\n\nTrial registration: Not applicable.\n\nFunding: Not specified.",
