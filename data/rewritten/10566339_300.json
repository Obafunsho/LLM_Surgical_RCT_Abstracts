This study assesses the effectiveness of ERAS protocols in total joint replacement (TJR) surgery.\n\nMethods: This randomised controlled trial was conducted at a tertiary care hospital. Participants were adults aged 18-75 undergoing TJR, with ASA physical status I-III. The intervention group received ERAS protocols, including nutritional support, pain management, fluid management, and early mobilization, while the control group received standard care. The primary outcome was hospital length of stay (LOS), measured over a 30-day postoperative period. Randomisation was computer-generated, with allocation concealment via sealed envelopes. Blinding was applied to outcome assessors.\n\nResults: A total of 200 participants were randomised: 100 to the ERAS group and 100 to the control group, between January 2020 and June 2021. Analysis included 98 participants in the ERAS group and 97 in the control group, using an intention-to-treat approach. The ERAS group had a significantly reduced LOS (mean difference = 1.5 days, 95% CI 1.0 to 2.0; p < 0.001). Adverse events were reported in 3% of the ERAS group and 1% of the control group, with mild gastrointestinal side-effects.\n\nInterpretation: The implementation of ERAS protocols in TJR surgery significantly reduces hospital LOS without increasing adverse events, highlighting their clinical value in improving patient outcomes.
