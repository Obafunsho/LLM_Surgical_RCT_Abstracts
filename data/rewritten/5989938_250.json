A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Fibrin Sealant Patch in Reducing Postoperative Pancreatic Fistula\n\nBackground: This multicentre, randomised controlled trial evaluated the efficacy of a fibrin sealant patch in reducing postoperative pancreatic fistula (POPF) in patients undergoing pancreatoduodenectomy with pancreatojejunostomy.\n\nMethods: Conducted across six tertiary-care centres in Austria, 142 patients aged 18 years or older were randomised 1:1 to receive either a fibrin-coated collagen patch (patch group) or no patch (control group). Randomisation was stratified by gland texture, pancreatic duct size, and neoadjuvant treatment. The primary outcome was POPF, assessed up to 42 days post-surgery. Secondary outcomes included postoperative complications, drain-related factors, and hospital stay duration. Randomisation was performed using a secure internet-based service, with allocation concealment ensured. Blinding was not applied.\n\nResults: Between September 2013 and March 2015, 71 patients were randomised to each group. Analysis was conducted on all 142 patients using an intention-to-treat approach. POPF occurred in 63% of the patch group and 56% of the control group (p=0.392). No significant differences were observed in postoperative complications, drain amylase concentration, time to drain removal, fistula closure, or hospital stay. Obesity, soft gland texture, and small duct size were significant risk factors for POPF. Adverse events were similar between groups.\n\nInterpretation: The fibrin sealant patch did not reduce POPF incidence or complications. Trial registration: EudraCT 2013-000639-29.
