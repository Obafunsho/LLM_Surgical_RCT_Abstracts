A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Sugammadex Dosing in Morbidly Obese Patients\n\nBackground: This systematic review evaluates the optimal weight scalar for dosing sugammadex in morbidly obese (MO) patients (BMI≥40 kg/m²) to reverse neuromuscular blockade (NMB).\n\nMethods: Eight randomised controlled trials (RCTs) involving 645 participants were included. Participants were MO patients undergoing bariatric surgery. The intervention was sugammadex dosing based on different weight scalars: total body weight (TBW), ideal body weight (IBW), 20% corrected body weight (CBW), and 40% CBW. The primary outcome was recovery time from moderate or deep NMB, measured by the time to a Train of Four (TOF) ratio of 0.9. Secondary outcomes included time to extubation and incidence of postoperative residual curarization (PORC). Randomisation methods and allocation concealment varied across studies, and blinding was not consistently reported.\n\nResults: A dose of 2 mg/kg of sugammadex based on 40% CBW and a 4 mg/kg dose based on 40% CBW provided reliable and timely reversal of moderate and deep NMB, respectively. No significant adverse events were reported.\n\nInterpretation: Dosing sugammadex based on 40% CBW is effective and cost-efficient for reversing NMB in MO patients. Further standardised trials are needed to confirm these findings.",
