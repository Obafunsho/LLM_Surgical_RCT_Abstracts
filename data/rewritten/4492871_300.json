A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of a Frailty Education Module for Surgical Residents\n\nBackground: Frailty is a critical risk factor for adverse surgical outcomes, yet surgical residents often lack the ability to recognize it. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of a frailty education module on residents' risk assessment for lobectomy.\n\nMethods: In this randomised controlled trial, traditional track cardiothoracic surgery residents were randomised to either an online frailty education module (experimental group) or no training (control group). Participants read clinical vignettes, estimated lobectomy risk, and rated clinical factors. They then viewed videos of standardized patients exhibiting either frail or vigorous behavior and provided final risk estimates. The primary outcome was the change in risk estimates, measured immediately after video viewing. Randomisation was computer-generated, and allocation was concealed. Blinding was not applicable. The study was conducted at [study setting], with eligibility criteria including [participant eligibility criteria].\n\nResults: Forty-one residents were randomised (20 experimental, 21 control) between [recruitment period]. Initial risk estimates were similar between groups. The experimental group rated clinical factors as \"very important\" more frequently (47.6% vs 38.5%; p<0.001). Video viewing significantly altered risk estimates (frail: 50±75% increase, p=0.008; vigorous: 14±32% decrease, p=0.043), with a greater change in the experimental group (10.0±8.1 vs 5.1±7.7; p<0.001). The experimental group scored higher on frailty knowledge (93.7% vs 75.2%; p<0.001). No adverse events were reported.\n\nInterpretation: The frailty education module enhanced residents' frailty knowledge and influenced surgical risk assessment. Incorporating frailty training may improve residents' ability to assess surgical risks.\n\nTrial registration: [Trial registration number]\n\nFunding: [Source of funding]",
