Eligibility criteria included patients with suspected lung cancer, confirmed by preoperative CT with 1.25-mm slices. Participants received 0.025 mg/kg of pafolacianine intravenously 1 to 24 hours before surgery. The primary outcome was the identification of occult lesions, measured intraoperatively.\n\nResults: Between November 2019 and the study's conclusion, 100 participants were randomised to the intervention group. IMI identified 29 occult lesions in 23 participants (23%). Of these, 10 lesions (34%) were malignant. No additional morbidity was observed in participants with resected lesions. The positive predictive value for malignancy was 38%. Adverse events were minimal, with no significant perioperative morbidity reported.\n\nInterpretation: IMI with pafolacianine effectively identifies occult malignant lesions during pulmonary resection, providing additional data to enhance surgical decision-making. The trial was registered under NCT04241315 and funded by Medidata Solutions.",
