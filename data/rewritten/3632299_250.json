This study evaluates the response of leg muscle, whole-body muscle, and non-muscle protein to amino acid signaling in pediatric burn patients 6 months post-injury.\n\nMethods: This randomised controlled trial included 10 pediatric burn patients (7.4 ± 3.8 years; 27.4 ± 14.7 kg) and 5 healthy young males (22 ± 3 years; 76 ± 15 kg) as controls. Participants underwent an 8-hour stable isotope infusion study, with a 3-hour amino acid solution infusion (10% Travasol). Femoral arterial and venous blood samples and muscle biopsies were collected. The primary outcome was leg muscle protein synthesis rate, measured during the infusion period. Randomisation and allocation concealment methods were not specified. Blinding details were not provided.\n\nResults: Amino acid infusion significantly increased leg muscle protein synthesis in both groups (P < 0.05). In burn patients, protein breakdown increased nonsignificantly, resulting in a negative net balance. In controls, protein breakdown decreased nonsignificantly, leading to a significant increase in net balance (P < 0.05). Whole-body protein breakdown was significantly higher in burn patients. No adverse events were reported.\n\nInterpretation: Pediatric burn patients exhibit unresponsive leg muscle protein net deposition to amino acid infusion and higher whole-body protein breakdown compared to controls. Further research is needed to optimize nutritional interventions post-burn injury.\n\nTrial registration: Not provided.\n\nFunding: Not specified.",
