A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial on the Impact of Perivascular Adipose Tissue Preservation in Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting\n\nBackground: Coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) is a common procedure for myocardial revascularization in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD). The study investigates the effect of preserving perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) on graft patency and vasospasm.\n\nMethods: This randomised controlled trial was conducted at a tertiary care hospital. Participants were patients undergoing CABG, with eligibility criteria including age 18-75 and diagnosis of CAD. The unit of randomisation was the individual patient. Sample size calculation determined 200 participants were needed. Participants were randomised to either PVAT-preserved (intervention) or PVAT-removed (control) groups. Randomisation was computer-generated, with allocation concealment using sealed envelopes. Blinding was applied to outcome assessors.\n\nIntervention: The intervention group received CABG with PVAT-preserved conduits, while the control group had PVAT removed.\n\nOutcome: The primary outcome was graft patency at 12 months post-surgery.\n\nResults: 200 participants were randomised: 100 to the intervention and 100 to the control group. Analysis was intention-to-treat. The intervention group showed a higher graft patency rate (91% vs. 81%, p = 0.046). Adverse events were mild and occurred in 3% of the intervention group and 1% of the control group.\n\nInterpretation: Preserving PVAT during CABG significantly improves graft patency and reduces vasospasm. Further studies are needed to confirm these findings.\n\nTrial registration: NCT12345678\n\nFunding: This trial was funded by the National Institutes of Health.",
