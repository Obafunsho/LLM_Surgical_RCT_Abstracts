A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Magnetic Seed Localization for Index Node Removal in Stage III Melanoma\n\nBackground: This pilot study evaluated the feasibility of using magnetic seed localization for targeted index lymph node removal as a response indicator after neoadjuvant checkpoint inhibition therapy in patients with stage III melanoma.\n\nMethods: Twelve patients with resectable stage III melanoma and measurable lymph node metastasis were recruited at the Netherlands Cancer Institute. Participants were randomly assigned to one of three ipilimumab plus nivolumab combination schemes. A magnetic seed was placed in the largest lymph node, which was surgically removed after 6 weeks of therapy. The primary outcome was the congruence of therapeutic response between the index node and the total lymph node basin, assessed using the International Neoadjuvant Melanoma Consortium scoring system.\n\nResults: All 12 magnetic seeds were successfully detected and removed. The index node response was congruent with the total basin response in all cases. Seven patients achieved a pathological complete response (pCR), three had a near-pCR, one had a pathological partial response, and one had no response. No adverse events related to the magnetic seed localization were reported.\n\nInterpretation: Magnetic seed localization is a feasible and reliable method for targeted index node removal in stage III melanoma, potentially allowing patients with a (near-)complete response to avoid completion lymph node dissection. Further studies with larger sample sizes are needed to confirm these findings.\n\nTrial registration: NL58293.031.16\n\nFunding: Not specified.",
