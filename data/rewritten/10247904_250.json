A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Tricuspid Annuloplasty During Mitral Valve Surgery\n\nBackground: This study evaluates the impact of tricuspid annuloplasty (TA) during mitral valve surgery (MVS) for degenerative mitral regurgitation (MR) with moderate or less tricuspid regurgitation (TR) on the need for permanent pacemaker (PPM) implantation.\n\nMethods: In a multicenter, randomised controlled trial, 401 patients were randomised to MVS alone (n=203) or MVS with TA (n=198). The primary outcome was the composite rate of death, re-operation for TR, or TR progression at 2 years. Randomisation was computer-generated, and allocation was concealed. Blinding was not specified. Potential risk factors for PPMs were assessed using multivariable time-to-event models.\n\nResults: A PPM was implanted in 36 patients (9.6%; 95% CI 6.8%−13.0%) within 2 years, with 30/187 (16.0%) in the MVS+TA group and 6/188 (3.2%) in the MVS group (RR 5.08; 95% CI 2.16–11.94; p<0.001). Most implants (80.6%) occurred within 30 days postoperatively. Independent risk factors for PPMs were TA (HR 5.94; 95% CI 2.27–15.53; p<0.001), increasing age (HR 1.23; 95% CI 1.01–1.52; p=0.04), and LVEF (HR 0.96; 95% CI 0.92–0.99; p=0.02).\n\nInterpretation: TA during MVS reduces TR progression but increases PPM implantation risk. Further research is needed to mitigate this risk.\n\nTrial registration: [Trial registration number]\n\nFunding: [Source of funding]",
