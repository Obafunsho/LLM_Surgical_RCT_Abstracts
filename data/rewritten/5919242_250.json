A 250-word version\n\nTitle: A Randomised Controlled Trial Comparing Patellofemoral Arthroplasty and Total Knee Arthroplasty for Severe Patellofemoral Osteoarthritis\n\nBackground: This study aimed to compare the outcomes of patellofemoral arthroplasty (PFA) and total knee arthroplasty (TKA) in patients with severe patellofemoral osteoarthritis.\n\nMethods: In this randomised controlled trial, 100 patients with debilitating symptoms and isolated patellofemoral disease were recruited from 2007 to 2014. Participants were randomised to receive either PFA or TKA. Randomisation was blinded for the first year and quasi-blinded to assessors. The primary outcome was the area under the curve (AUC) for SF-36 bodily pain over 2 years. Secondary outcomes included range of movement (ROM), patient-reported outcomes (PROs), and complications. \n\nResults: The AUC for SF-36 bodily pain was significantly better for PFA (9.2 months, SD 4.3) compared to TKA (6.5 months, SD 4.5; p = 0.008). Improvements in SF-36 physical functioning, KOOS symptoms, and OKS also favored PFA. At 2 years, only KOOS function differed significantly between groups. ROM was better in the PFA group at all time points. Two revisions occurred in the PFA group. No significant difference in complications was observed.\n\nInterpretation: PFA provides better knee-specific quality of life and faster recovery compared to TKA in the first 2 years post-operation. PFA patients regained preoperative ROM, while TKA patients lost 10° of ROM. No differences in complications were found.",
