A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial on Cardioprotective Strategies in Cardioplegic Solutions\n\nBackground: Cardioplegic solutions are essential in cardiac surgery to protect the myocardium during ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury. This study evaluates the efficacy of novel cardioprotective strategies as adjuvants to cardioplegic solutions.\n\nMethods: This randomised controlled trial was conducted at a cardiovascular surgery center. Participants were patients undergoing cardiac surgery requiring cardioplegia. Eligibility criteria included adults with cardiovascular pathologies. Participants were randomised into two groups: intervention (cardioplegic solution with adjuvants) and control (standard cardioplegic solution). Randomisation was computer-generated, and allocation was concealed using sealed envelopes. Blinding was applied to outcome assessors.\n\nObjective: To assess the impact of adjuvant-enhanced cardioplegic solutions on myocardial protection.\n\nOutcome: The primary outcome was the extent of myocardial damage, measured by cardiac biomarkers, over a 48-hour postoperative period.\n\nResults: A total of 200 participants were randomised, 100 to each group, between January 2020 and June 2021. Analysis included 98 in the intervention group and 97 in the control group, using an intention-to-treat approach. The intervention group showed a significant reduction in myocardial damage (mean difference = 5.2, 95% CI 3.1 to 7.3; p = 0.01). Adverse events were mild, with 3% in the intervention group and 1% in the control group experiencing side effects.\n\nTrial registration: NCT12345678.\n\nFunding: This trial was funded by the National Institute of Health.",
