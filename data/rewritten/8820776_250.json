A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Physical Activity Intervention in Colorectal Cancer Surgery\n\nBackground: Preoperative exercise interventions are recommended to improve recovery after colorectal cancer surgery. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of a short-term, unsupervised exercise intervention on self-assessed physical recovery.\n\nMethods: This randomised, controlled, open-label, multicenter trial was conducted in six hospitals in Sweden. Participants aged ≥20 years scheduled for elective colorectal cancer surgery were eligible. Exclusion criteria included emergency surgery and inability to perform study-specific procedures. Participants were randomised 1:1 to either a physical activity intervention or usual care. The intervention included aerobic activity and inspiratory muscle training 2 weeks preoperatively and 4 weeks postoperatively. The primary outcome was self-assessed physical recovery 4 weeks postoperatively. Randomisation was computer-generated with allocation concealment. Outcome assessors were blinded.\n\nResults: Between January 22, 2015, and May 28, 2020, 761 participants were randomised (intervention: 379, control: 382). After exclusions, 668 participants (intervention: 317, control: 351) were analysed using intention-to-treat. The intervention showed no effect on the primary outcome (adjusted odds ratio 0.84, 95% CI 0.62–1.15). No adverse events were reported.\n\nInterpretation: The physical activity intervention did not improve short-term self-assessed physical recovery. Current recommendations for preoperative physical activity interventions should be reconsidered.\n\nTrial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02299596.\n\nFunding: Not specified.",
