A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Escalation of Care in Deteriorating Ward Patients: A Randomised Controlled Trial\n\nBackground: Escalation of care for deteriorating patients is crucial in preventing adverse outcomes. This study aimed to develop a theoretical understanding of escalation and identify success factors.\n\nMethods: This randomised controlled trial was conducted in two NHS Trusts. Participants included medical, surgical, and trauma patients. Non-participant observations were used to examine escalation events from February 16, 2021, to March 17, 2022. The primary outcome was the identification of escalation communication phenotypes, measured over 105 hours of observation. Randomisation and allocation concealment methods were not applicable. Blinding was not implemented.\n\nResults: A total of 151 escalation events were captured. Half were not early warning score-initiated, resulting from bleeding, infection, or chest pain. Four communication phenotypes were identified: Outcome Focused, Informative, General Concern, and Spontaneous Interaction Escalations. Outcome Focused Escalation was the most common, while Spontaneous Interaction Escalations were least frequent. No adverse events were reported.\n\nInterpretation: Understanding non-triggering escalations can inform system designs to better support staff. Differing escalation communication phenotypes exist, with Informative Escalations indicating an organizational requirement to report triggering scores. Increasing Spontaneous Escalations through hospital design may be beneficial.\n\nTrial registration: ISRCTN 38850\n\nFunding: Funded by the National Institute for Health and Care Research.",
