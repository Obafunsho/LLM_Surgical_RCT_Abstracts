A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial on Ultrasound-Guided Vascular Access Techniques\n\nBackground: This study investigates the effectiveness of ultrasound-guided vascular access techniques versus traditional landmark-based methods in improving procedural success rates and reducing complications.\n\nMethods: A randomised controlled trial was conducted with healthcare providers as the unit of randomisation. The sample size was calculated to detect a clinically significant difference in success rates. Eligible participants were healthcare providers trained in vascular access, recruited from multiple hospitals. The intervention group employed real-time ultrasound guidance, while the control group used landmark-based techniques. The primary outcome was the success rate of vascular access procedures, assessed immediately post-procedure. Randomisation was computer-generated, and allocation concealment was ensured using sealed envelopes. Outcome assessors were blinded to group allocation.\n\nResults: A total of 200 participants were randomised: 100 to the intervention group and 100 to the control group, recruited between January 2020 and June 2021. Analysis included 98 in the intervention group and 97 in the control group, using an intention-to-treat approach. The intervention group demonstrated a significantly higher success rate (mean difference = 15%, 95% CI 10% to 20%; p < 0.001). Adverse events occurred in 3% of the intervention group and 1% of the control group, with no severe complications reported.\n\nInterpretation: The use of real-time ultrasound guidance significantly enhances the success rate of vascular access procedures and reduces the risk of complications compared to landmark-based techniques. These findings support the adoption of ultrasound guidance as a standard practice for vascular access. The trial was registered under number NCT12345678 and funded by the National Institutes of Health.",
