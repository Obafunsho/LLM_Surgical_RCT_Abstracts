Eligibility criteria included elective laryngeal surgery, excluding those with ASA status >III, planned laser surgery, or COPD >GOLD II. Participants were randomly allocated to either the Tritube-FCV group or the MLT-VCV group. The primary outcome was the concealment of laryngeal structures, measured immediately post-intubation. Randomisation was computer-generated in blocks of 10, with allocation concealed in closed envelopes. Blinding was not possible due to visible differences in tubes.\n\nResults: From October 2017 to May 2018, 20 patients were randomised to each group. Analysis was per-protocol. The Tritube group showed significantly less laryngeal concealment (7% [6 to 9]) compared to the MLT group (22% [18 to 27], p < 0.001). Respiratory system compliance was higher with the Tritube (61 [52 to 71] ml cmH2O−1) than with the MLT (46 [41 to 51] ml cmH2O−1, p < 0.001). Plateau pressure was lower in the Tritube group (14 [13 to 15] cmH2O) compared to the MLT group (17 [16 to 18] cmH2O, p < 0.001). No significant differences in surgical conditions were observed (p = 0.06). No adverse events were reported.\n\nTrial registration: DRKS00013097.\n\nFunding: Not specified.",
