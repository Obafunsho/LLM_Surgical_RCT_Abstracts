Participants were categorized based on adherence to guideline recommendations. The primary outcome was long-term RC-AVF failure, assessed over a mean follow-up of 1.98 years. \n\nResults: Patients with RC-AVF created outside guideline recommendations had smaller arterial (p < 0.001) and venous (p < 0.001) diameters, higher use of central venous catheters (CVC) at creation (p = 0.041), and increased 6-week (p = 0.012) and long-term AVF failure (p = 0.016). ROC analysis identified optimal thresholds of 2.75 mm for radial artery and 2.52 mm for cephalic vein. Adherence to guidelines was associated with lower long-term failure (HR: 0.44, p = 0.012), but significance was lost after adjusting for cardiovascular risk factors and CVC presence (HR: 0.69, p = 0.328). Only cephalic vein diameter remained an independent predictor (HR: 0.68, p = 0.026).\n\nInterpretation: Cephalic vein diameter is crucial for long-term RC-AVF success, independent of demographic and cardiovascular factors. Adherence to ESVS guidelines aids functional RC-AVF creation, but additional factors must be considered for optimal outcomes.",
