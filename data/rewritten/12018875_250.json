Patients aged ≥18 years with confirmed colorectal peritoneal metastases were included. The intervention involved intravenous administration of 10 mg 111 In-labelled DOTA–labetuzumab-IRDye800CW, followed by SPECT/CT and intraoperative radiodetection and NIRF imaging. The primary outcome was the safety and feasibility of the procedure, assessed over a 10-day period post-surgery. No randomisation or blinding was employed.\n\nResults: Seven patients were included. No study-related severe adverse events were reported. Preoperative imaging revealed previously undetected metastases in one patient. The mean SPECT/CT peritoneal cancer index score was 3(2), and the intraoperative score was 14(7) (P = 0.032). A total of 52 lesions were removed, with 37 confirmed malignant. NIRF imaging detected 34 (92%) of 37 malignant lesions, with 4 false-positive results. Mean fluorescence TBR was 3.4(1.8) and mean radiodetection TBR was 4.4(1.4).\n\nInterpretation: The study confirmed the safety and feasibility of using multimodal image-guided surgery in patients with colorectal peritoneal metastases.
