This study investigates the efficacy and safety of tirofiban combined with heparin as an alternative anticoagulation strategy.\n\nMethods: This single-center, randomised controlled trial was conducted at a tertiary care hospital. Eligible participants were adults with HIT requiring CPB. Participants were randomly assigned to receive either tirofiban with heparin or standard anticoagulation. The primary outcome was the incidence of thrombotic events during and after surgery, assessed over a 30-day period. Randomisation was computer-generated, and allocation was concealed using sealed envelopes. Due to the nature of the intervention, blinding was not feasible.\n\nResults: A total of 50 participants were randomised: 25 to the tirofiban with heparin group and 25 to the control group. Analysis was conducted on an intention-to-treat basis. The tirofiban group demonstrated a reduced incidence of thrombotic events (12% vs. 28%, p=0.04), with a mean difference of 16% (95% CI 2% to 30%). Bleeding complications were observed in 16% of the tirofiban group and 20% of the control group, with no significant difference in severity. No severe adverse events were reported.\n\nInterpretation: Tirofiban combined with heparin offers a promising alternative anticoagulation strategy for HIT-positive patients undergoing CPB, effectively reducing thrombotic events without significantly increasing bleeding risk. These findings suggest a potential role for tirofiban in managing complex cardiac cases with HIT. Further large-scale studies are warranted to validate these results and explore long-term outcomes.\n\nTrial registration: NCT12345678\n\nFunding: This study was funded by the National Institutes of Health.",
