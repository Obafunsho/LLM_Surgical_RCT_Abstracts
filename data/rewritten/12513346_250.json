A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial on Robotic Surgical Skill Assessment Methods\n\nBackground: Robot-assisted minimally invasive surgery (RAMIS) offers benefits over traditional surgery, necessitating effective skill assessment methods. Traditional assessments rely on expert observation, which is resource-intensive and biased.\n\nMethods: This randomised controlled trial evaluated new assessment methods for RAMIS using the da Vinci platform. Participants were eligible if they were surgical trainees at a tertiary hospital. The intervention group received automated evaluation systems, while the control group used structured grading rubrics. The primary outcome was the accuracy of skill assessment over a 6-month period. Randomisation was computer-generated, with allocation concealment via sealed envelopes. Blinding was applied to outcome assessors.\n\nResults: A total of 200 participants were randomised: 100 to the intervention and 100 to the control group, between January 2020 and June 2021. Analysis included 98 in the intervention group and 97 in the control group using an intention-to-treat approach. The intervention group showed improved assessment accuracy (mean difference = 5.2, 95% CI 3.1 to 7.3; p = 0.01). No adverse events were reported.\n\nInterpretation: Automated evaluation systems provide a more accurate and objective assessment of robotic surgical skills compared to traditional methods. These findings support the integration of data-driven assessment methods in surgical training programs.\n\nTrial registration: NCT12345678\n\nFunding: This trial was funded by the National Institute of Health.",
