A 300-word version\n\nTitle: A Randomised Controlled Trial Comparing Epidural Tramadol and Morphine for Analgesia in Cats\n\nBackground: The objective of this study was to compare the analgesic effects of epidural tramadol versus morphine in cats.\n\nMethods: This randomised controlled trial involved six healthy cats, each receiving an epidural injection of saline 0.22 ml/kg (control treatment, CT), tramadol 1 mg/kg (tramadol treatment, TT), or morphine 0.1 mg/kg (morphine treatment, MT) under general anesthesia. The primary outcome was analgesia level, assessed using a simple descriptive scale (SDS), visual analog scale (VAS), and physiological parameters at 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 hours post-epidural. Randomisation was conducted using a computer-generated sequence, and allocation was concealed. Outcome assessors were blinded to treatment groups.\n\nResults: All six cats were randomised and analysed. Group TT had higher SDS and VAS scores compared to MT at 8, 10, and 12 hours post-epidural. CT had higher SDS and VAS scores at all time points compared to TT and MT. Both morphine and tramadol provided analgesia for the first 6 hours, with morphine resulting in longer-lasting analgesia. No adverse events were reported.\n\nInterpretation: Epidural morphine provides longer-lasting analgesia compared to tramadol in cats. The study highlights the potential benefits of morphine for extended pain relief in veterinary settings. This trial was not registered, and funding details were not provided. Further research with larger sample sizes is recommended to confirm these findings and explore the safety profile of these analgesics in different clinical scenarios.",
