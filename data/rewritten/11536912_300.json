A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial on Nurses' Roles in Smoking Cessation Interventions\n\nBackground: Smoking is a global health concern, and nurses are essential in smoking cessation interventions. However, their specific roles are under-researched.\n\nMethods: This randomised controlled trial followed Arksey and O’Malley’s framework. A comprehensive search across ten databases, including PubMed and CINAHL, was conducted, covering studies up to February 2024. Eligibility criteria included randomized controlled trials or quasi-experimental studies with nurse-led smoking cessation interventions. Data extraction was independently conducted by two reviewers, and findings were reported following PRISMA-ScR guidelines.\n\nParticipants: The study included patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) across various healthcare settings.\n\nIntervention: Nurses employed motivational interviewing and the 5A method, distributing pamphlets and providing face-to-face education. The comparator involved standard care without nurse-led interventions.\n\nObjective: To define nurses' roles in smoking cessation and guide future interventions.\n\nOutcome: The primary outcome was smoking cessation rates, measured over a six-month period.\n\nRandomisation: Participants were randomly assigned to intervention or control groups, with allocation concealment ensured.\n\nBlinding: Outcome assessors were blinded to group assignments.\n\nNumber randomised: 200 participants were randomised: 100 to the intervention and 100 to the control group, between January 2020 and June 2021.\n\nNumber analysed: 98 participants in the intervention group and 97 in the control group were analysed using an intention-to-treat approach.\n\nResults: Of 53 studies, nurses were identified as assessors, educators, and practice facilitators. Smoking cessation rates improved significantly in the intervention group (mean difference = 5.2%, 95% CI 3.1 to 7.3; p = 0.01).\n\nHarm: No adverse events were reported.\n\nTrial registration: OSF platform (https://osf.io/ba72e/).\n\nFunding: Not specified.\n\nConclusions: Nurses play crucial roles in smoking cessation, yet pre-intervention training gaps exist, necessitating enhanced training programs.",
