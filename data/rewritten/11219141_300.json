A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial Comparing Landmark-Guided and Ultrasound-Guided Intra-Articular Analgesic Injections for Shoulder Dislocation Reduction\n\nBackground: Effective pain control during shoulder dislocation reduction is crucial for patient comfort. This study aims to compare the efficacy of landmark-guided versus ultrasound-guided intra-articular analgesic injections.\n\nMethods: This randomised controlled trial was conducted at a tertiary referral care center from August 2021 to March 2023. Twenty-eight patients with anterior shoulder dislocation were randomly assigned to either the landmark-guided or ultrasound-guided intra-articular lidocaine injection group. Randomisation was performed using a computer-generated sequence, and allocation was concealed using sealed envelopes. The primary outcome was pain reduction, assessed using the Visual Analog Scale (VAS) before and after injection, and before injection and after reduction. Secondary outcomes included length of stay in the emergency department and complications. Patients were followed for 2 weeks. Blinding was not applied to patients or clinicians.\n\nResults: Fourteen patients were randomised to each group. There were no significant differences in pain reduction between preinjection and postinjection (landmark-guided: ΔVAS 2.8 ± 1.1, ultrasound-guided: ΔVAS 2.9 ± 1.0; mean difference -0.14 [95% CI -0.97 to 0.68]; p = 0.72) or between preinjection and postreduction (landmark-guided: ΔVAS 6.6 ± 2.1, ultrasound-guided: ΔVAS 5.8 ± 1.8; mean difference 0.79 [95% CI -0.74 to 2.31]; p = 0.30). Length of stay was similar (landmark-guided: 162 ± 38 minutes, ultrasound-guided: 184 ± 73 minutes; mean difference 22 minutes [95% CI -67 to 24]; p = 0.33). No complications were reported in either group during the 2-week follow-up.\n\nInterpretation: Both techniques were equally effective in pain management and had similar lengths of stay and complication rates. These findings provide valuable guidance for orthopaedic surgeons in selecting the appropriate technique based on available resources and expertise.\n\nTrial registration: [Trial registration number]\n\nFunding: [Source of funding]",
