A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial Comparing McCoy, Macintosh, and Truview Laryngoscopes for Bougie-Aided Nasotracheal Intubation\n\nBackground: This study aims to compare the performance of McCoy, Macintosh, and Truview laryngoscopes during bougie-aided nasotracheal intubation (NTI) in terms of intubation time, success rate, and hemodynamic changes.\n\nMethods: A prospective randomised controlled trial was conducted at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Bhubaneswar. Forty-five ASA I-II adult patients, aged 18-60, requiring NTI for elective oral surgery, were enrolled. Exclusion criteria included ASA III/IV, restricted mouth opening, and BMI >30. Patients were randomly assigned to one of three laryngoscope groups (McCoy, Macintosh, Truview) using a computer-generated sequence with allocation concealment via sequentially numbered, opaque, sealed envelopes. The primary outcome was intubation time, measured from endotracheal tube insertion to capnograph visualization. Secondary outcomes included first attempt success rate, Cormack-Lehane grade, and hemodynamic responses. Blinding was applied to the patient, data collector, and analyst.\n\nResults: Fifteen patients were randomised to each group. Intubation times were 86.87 ± 15.92 s (McCoy), 82.87 ± 16.46 s (Macintosh), and 79.93 ± 14.53 s (Truview), with Truview being the shortest. CL grade 1 was more frequent in the Truview group (53.3%), while CL grade 3 was observed in 20% of McCoy and Macintosh groups. No significant adverse events were reported.\n\nInterpretation: McCoy, Macintosh, and Truview laryngoscopes are comparable in performance during bougie-aided NTI, with Truview offering the shortest intubation time and better visualization. The study supports the use of Truview for efficient NTI.\n\nTrial registration: CTRI/2017/10/010194\n\nFunding: None",
