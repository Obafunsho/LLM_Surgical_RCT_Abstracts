A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Highly Porous Metal Tibia in Total Knee Arthroplasty\n\nBackground: This randomised controlled trial evaluated the effectiveness of a highly porous metal tibia compared to a traditional modular cemented tibia in total knee arthroplasty (TKA) concerning survivorship, Knee Society scores, range of motion (ROM), and complications.\n\nMethods: Between 2003 and 2006, 397 patients (age 67.8 ± 8.7 years; 54% female) were randomised into three groups: (1) traditional modular cemented tibia; (2) cemented highly porous metal tibia; and (3) uncemented highly porous metal tibia. Stratified randomisation was based on surgeon, patient’s age, sex, and body mass index. The primary outcome was 5-year survivorship. Secondary outcomes included Knee Society scores, ROM, and complications. Radiographic assessments evaluated alignment, radiolucency, and implant migration/loosening. Patients were followed until death, revision, or for a minimum of 2 years (mean, 5 years; range, 2–9 years). Four patients were lost to follow-up before 2 years.\n\nResults: At 5 years, survivorship was similar across groups (96.8% [1]; 97.6% [2]; 96.7% [3]; p = 0.59). A per-protocol analysis showed no highly porous metal tibia was revised for aseptic loosening. Knee Society scores, ROM, and complication rates were comparable between groups. Adverse events were not detailed in the manuscript.\n\nInterpretation: At 5 years, highly porous metal tibias demonstrated comparable fixation durability and functional outcomes to traditional cemented tibias in TKA. Trial registration and funding details were not provided. The study supports the use of highly porous metal tibias as a viable option in TKA, offering similar outcomes to traditional methods. Further research is needed to assess long-term outcomes and potential adverse events.",
