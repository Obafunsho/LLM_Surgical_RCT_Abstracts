A 250-word version\n\nTitle: A Randomised Controlled Trial Comparing Anterior Out-of-Plane and In-Plane Techniques for Ultrasound-Guided Subclavian Vein Cannulation\n\nBackground: Subclavian vein cannulation is essential in surgical settings. This study compares the novel anterior out-of-plane technique with the conventional in-plane approach for ultrasound-guided supraclavicular subclavian vein cannulation.\n\nMethods: This single-centre, open-label, randomised controlled trial was conducted at a tertiary care centre from January 2023 to July 2024. A total of 128 patients undergoing elective surgeries requiring central venous access were randomised to either the anterior out-of-plane or in-plane technique. Randomisation was performed using a computer-generated sequence with allocation concealment via sealed envelopes. The primary outcome was the first-pass success rate, measured immediately after the procedure. Secondary outcomes included puncture and cannulation times, needle redirections, additional punctures, and complications. Data were analysed using independent-sample t-tests and Chi-square tests.\n\nResults: Of the 128 patients randomised, 126 were analysed (64 out-of-plane, 62 in-plane). The first-pass success rate was significantly higher in the out-of-plane group (95%) compared to the in-plane group (77%) (p < 0.05). The out-of-plane approach also demonstrated shorter puncture and cannulation times and fewer complications, including arterial punctures (1 vs 5).\n\nInterpretation: The anterior out-of-plane technique for ultrasound-guided supraclavicular subclavian vein cannulation is more successful and efficient than the in-plane approach. \n\nTrial registration: CTRI/2022/09/045231.
