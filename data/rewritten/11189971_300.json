This study aimed to critically appraise and define POCD, synthesizing its attributes, risk factors, and consequences.\n\nMethods: This randomised controlled trial employed Rodgers’ 6-step evolutionary concept analysis. Participants were selected from Medline, CINAHL, and Web of Science databases, focusing on English-language quantitative studies on human subjects using standard cognitive assessments. Two independent reviewers conducted abstract and full-text screening, data extraction, and appraisal. The primary outcome was the definition and characterization of POCD, assessed over several weeks to years.\n\nResults: A total of 86 articles were included. POCD was characterized by subtle-to-extensive cognitive changes affecting single or multiple domains post-surgery, transient and reversible, lasting weeks to years. Consequences included impaired quality of life, increased dependency, cognitive decline, elevated dementia risk, rising healthcare costs, and mortality. The study highlighted the need for a unified definition to aid in diagnosis and treatment.\n\nInterpretation: This trial offers a refined definition and comprehensive analysis of POCD, providing valuable insights for researchers and clinicians. Future research should focus on refining operational definitions to better capture POCD's defining attributes and improve patient outcomes.\n\nTrial registration: Not provided.\n\nFunding: Not specified.",
