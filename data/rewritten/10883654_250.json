A 250-word version\n\nTitle: A Randomised Controlled Trial of Neoadjuvant GAP Therapy in Resectable High-Risk Intrahepatic Cholangiocarcinoma\n\nBackground: Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (IHCC) often recurs post-resection. This study evaluates the feasibility of neoadjuvant gemcitabine, cisplatin, and nab-paclitaxel (GAP) in resectable, high-risk IHCC.\n\nMethods: A multi-institutional, single-arm, phase II trial was conducted. Eligibility included tumor size >5 cm, multiple tumors, major vascular invasion, or lymph node involvement. Patients received preoperative GAP (gemcitabine 800 mg/m², cisplatin 25 mg/m², nab-paclitaxel 100 mg/m² on days 1 and 8 of a 21-day cycle) for 4 cycles before curative-intent resection. The primary endpoint was completion of chemotherapy and surgery. Secondary endpoints included adverse events, radiologic response, recurrence-free survival (RFS), and overall survival (OS).\n\nResults: Thirty patients were enrolled. Median age was 60.5 years. Ten patients (33%) experienced grade ≥3 adverse events, mainly neutropenia and diarrhea; 50% required dose reduction. Disease control rate was 90% (progressive disease: 10%, partial response: 23%, stable disease: 67%). No treatment-related mortality occurred. Twenty-two patients (73%, 90% CI 57–86; p=0.008) completed chemotherapy and surgery. Two patients (9%) had minor postoperative complications. Median hospital stay was 4 days. Median RFS was 7.1 months. Median OS was 24 months, not reached in resected patients.\n\nInterpretation: Neoadjuvant GAP is feasible and safe for IHCC resection without adverse perioperative outcomes.\n\nTrial registration: [Trial registration number]\n\nFunding: [Source of funding]",
