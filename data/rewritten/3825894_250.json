The primary outcome was the incidence of outliers in postoperative hip-knee-ankle angles, measured within 6 weeks post-surgery. Secondary outcomes included femoral component rotation and coronal and sagittal alignments. Randomisation was computer-generated, and allocation was concealed using sealed envelopes. Outcome assessors were blinded to group allocation. The study was conducted at a single orthopedic center, with participants recruited between January 2020 and June 2021. Analysis was performed on an intention-to-treat basis.\n\nResults: Outliers in hip-knee-ankle angles were 12% in the patient-specific group and 10% in the conventional group (p=0.75). No significant differences were found in other alignment parameters. Patient-specific guides were abandoned in 8 cases (16%) due to malrotation and decreased tibial slope. No severe adverse events were reported in either group.\n\nInterpretation: Patient-specific instrumentation did not demonstrate superior accuracy compared to conventional methods and was frequently abandoned, suggesting no added benefit to patients.
