A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Family-Administered Delirium Assessment Post-Surgery\n\nBackground: Postoperative delirium is a common complication in older adults undergoing major elective surgery. This study aimed to evaluate the agreement between researchers’ and family members’ postoperative delirium assessments and to assess the incidence of positive FAM-CAM after hospital discharge up to 30 days postoperatively.\n\nMethods: This pre-specified sub-study of two multicenter randomized controlled trials involved patients aged 60 or older undergoing major elective surgery. Delirium was assessed using the CAM or CAM-ICU and structured chart review. Family members completed the FAM-CAM concurrently on postoperative days 1–3 and daily post-discharge until day 30. Agreement was analyzed using Generalized Linear Mixed Model and Bland-Altman analysis.\n\nResults: A total of 817 patients had 1349 concurrent assessments. Postoperative delirium incidence by researchers was 18.8%, while FAM-CAM detected 22.4%. Agreement beyond chance was 79.7% with a kappa of 0.33. Both methods showed high internal validity (CAM/CAM-ICU ICC = 0.938, FAM-CAM ICC = 0.985). Of 330 booklets, 133 were returned, with 18 patients showing delirium symptoms post-discharge, 9 of whom had been diagnosed during hospitalization.\n\nInterpretation: Family-administered FAM-CAM showed acceptable agreement with researchers’ assessments, detecting more frequent delirium symptoms. Family members identified delirium symptoms post-discharge, highlighting the tool's potential for early detection and intervention.\n\nTrial registration: Not provided.\n\nFunding: Not specified.",
