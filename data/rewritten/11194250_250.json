This study investigates the effect of unregulated distension pressure on LSVG endothelium.\n\nMethods: In this prospective, single-center randomised controlled trial, 21 paired vein samples from CABG patients were randomised into non-distended (group A) and distended (group B) groups. Histological and CD31 immunohistochemical analyses assessed endothelial cell loss. Pressure was recorded using different syringe sizes. Randomisation was computer-generated, and allocation was concealed. Outcome assessors were blinded.\n\nResults: Distended veins showed significantly higher endothelial cell loss (31.95% ± 31.31) compared to non-distended veins (11.67% ± 28.65) (p = 0.034). CD31 immunohistochemistry confirmed greater loss in distended veins (p = 0.001). Pressure with a 20-cc syringe was lower (44.5 mmHg) than with a 10-cc syringe (92.75 mmHg). Pre-existing endothelial injury was noted in 36% of diabetic patients. No adverse events were reported.\n\nInterpretation: Unregulated distension pressure during LSVG preparation is linked to increased endothelial damage. Controlled distension is crucial for preserving graft integrity. Trial registration: [Number]. Funding: [Source].",
