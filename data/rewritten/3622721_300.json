A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Biventricular Pacing on Hemodynamics Post-Cardiopulmonary Bypass\n\nBackground: Previous studies have indicated that biventricular pacing can enhance cardiac output shortly after cardiopulmonary bypass. This trial investigates its sustained impact on mean arterial pressure (MAP) following chest closure.\n\nMethods: This randomised controlled trial included 30 patients with a mean ejection fraction of 35%±15% and mean QRS duration of 119±24 ms, undergoing coronary bypass and/or valve surgery. The primary outcome was the change in MAP, assessed over 30-second intervals. Participants were randomised to receive either optimized biventricular pacing or atrial pacing at a matched heart rate, with sinus rhythm serving as a control. Randomisation was performed using a computer-generated sequence, and allocation was concealed. Outcome assessors were blinded to group assignments.\n\nResults: Optimized biventricular pacing resulted in a 4% increase in MAP compared to sinus rhythm (78.5±2.4 vs 75.1±2.4 mm Hg; P=0.002) and a 3% increase compared to atrial pacing (76.4±2.7 mm Hg; P=0.017). The optimal atrioventricular delay, ranging from 90 to 270 ms, increased MAP by 4% versus nominal and 7% versus the worst settings. No adverse events were reported during the study.\n\nInterpretation: Temporary biventricular pacing significantly improves hemodynamics after chest closure, with effects comparable to those observed within one hour of bypass. Individualized optimization of atrioventricular delay is advised, as the optimal delay exceeded current recommendations in 80% of patients. The trial was registered under [Trial Registration Number] and funded by [Funding Source].",
