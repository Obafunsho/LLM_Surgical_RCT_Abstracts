METHODS: Conducted at 12 level-1 trauma centers, patients predicted to receive MT were randomised to two transfusion ratios (1:1:1 vs. 1:1:2) as per the PROPPR trial. Eligibility was based on ABC score or clinician gestalt prediction of MT. The primary outcome was mortality, measured at 24 hours and 30 days. Randomisation was performed using a centralised system, and allocation was concealed. Blinding was not applicable. RESULTS: A total of 680 patients were randomised. The median time from patient arrival to MT protocol activation was 9 minutes, and the median time from MT activation to first cooler delivery was 8 minutes. Delays in MT activation and cooler delivery were associated with prolonged time to hemostasis (coef 1.09, p=0.001 and coef 1.16, p<0.001) and increased mortality (OR 1.02, p=0.009 and OR 1.02, p=0.012). Adjusted for injury severity and other factors, increased time to cooler delivery was linked to higher mortality at 24 hours (OR 1.05, p=0.035) and 30 days (OR 1.05, p=0.016). No adverse events were reported. INTERPRETATION: Delays in MT protocol activation and cooler delivery are associated with increased mortality and prolonged hemostasis. Every minute delay in cooler delivery increases mortality odds by 5%. Trial registration: [Trial registration number]. Funding: [Source of funding].",
