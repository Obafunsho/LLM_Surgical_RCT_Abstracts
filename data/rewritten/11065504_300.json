A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Durvalumab Addition to Induction FOLFOX and Preoperative Chemotherapy in Locally Advanced Esophageal Adenocarcinoma\n\nBackground: Neoadjuvant induction FOLFOX followed by PET-directed chemoradiation has demonstrated improved survival for esophageal adenocarcinoma. This study investigates the safety and efficacy of adding the anti-PD-1 antibody durvalumab to this regimen.\n\nMethods: This randomised controlled trial was conducted at [study setting]. Eligible participants were patients with locally advanced resectable esophageal/GEJ adenocarcinoma. Participants were randomised to receive either induction FOLFOX with durvalumab or FOLFOX alone, followed by PET-directed chemoradiation and esophagectomy. The primary endpoint was pathologic complete response (pCR) assessed post-surgery. Randomisation was performed using [randomisation method] with allocation concealment via [method]. Blinding was applied to [outcome assessors/patients/clinicians].\n\nResults: A total of 36 patients were randomised, with 18 in each group, between [recruitment period]. Thirty-three patients completed preoperative treatment and surgery. In the durvalumab group, pCR was achieved in 8 patients (22% [one-sided 90% lower bound: 13.3%]), and major pathologic response (mPR) in 22 patients (61% [one-sided 90% lower bound: 50%]). Twelve and 24-month overall survival (OS) was 92% and 85%, respectively. Preoperative treatment was well tolerated with no new safety signals. Adverse events were reported in [number] patients in the durvalumab group and [number] in the control group, with [severity and type of adverse events].\n\nInterpretation: The addition of durvalumab to induction FOLFOX and PET-directed chemoradiotherapy is safe and results in a high pathologic response rate and encouraging survival outcomes.
