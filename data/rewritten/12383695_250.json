A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial Comparing Cardiovascular Effects of Oxytocin and Carbetocin during Cesarean Section\n\nBackground: This randomised controlled trial aimed to compare the cardiovascular effects of oxytocin and carbetocin in pregnant women undergoing elective cesarean section. \n\nMethods: Seventy healthy pregnant women at term (37-41 weeks) were enrolled and randomly assigned to receive either 5 IU of intravenous oxytocin (OXY group, n=34) or 100 µg of intravenous carbetocin (CARBE group, n=36). Continuous Holter electrocardiograph recording was conducted from 30 minutes before the procedure until approximately 3 hours post-procedure. The primary outcome was the incidence of ST-segment changes, measured intraoperatively. Randomisation was based on the day of the month, and allocation was not concealed. Blinding was not implemented for patients or clinicians.\n\nResults: No significant differences were observed between the groups in terms of ST-segment depression, heart rate changes, or additional ventricular beats. The CARBE group showed no significant changes in mean arterial pressure during ST-segment depression. No adverse cardiovascular events were reported in either group.\n\nInterpretation: The study found no significant differences in cardiovascular effects between oxytocin and carbetocin during cesarean sections, suggesting both drugs are safe for use in this context. \n\nTrial registration: Not provided.\n\nFunding: Not specified.",
