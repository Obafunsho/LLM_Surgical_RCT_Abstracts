  "abstract": "300-word version:\n\nBackground: Juxtarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm (JR-AAA) poses a significant therapeutic challenge due to the absence of a proximal landing zone for endovascular repair. Parallel stenting techniques, such as the chimney technique, provide a viable option for maintaining patency of visceral branches while achieving aneurysm exclusion. Methods: This case study details the urgent endovascular treatment of a 62-year-old male with JR-AAA using the chimney technique. The patient, classified as ASA III due to high cardiological risk, underwent the procedure with a C3 31x150 mm Excluder® bifurcated endoprosthesis and Viabahn® self-expanding covered stents for both renal arteries. Results: The procedure was completed without complications, and the patient was discharged on the third day post-admission. Over a 24-month follow-up period, serial angiotomography confirmed complete exclusion of the aneurysm, no signs of leaks or stent migration, and preserved patency of both renal arteries. The aneurysm diameter reduced by approximately 15%. Interpretation: The chimney technique is a feasible and effective option for the urgent treatment of JR-AAA, offering good medium-term outcomes. It provides an immediate solution in high-risk patients where conventional surgery is not viable. Further long-term studies are necessary to determine the true role of parallel stenting techniques in the management of complex aneurysms.",
