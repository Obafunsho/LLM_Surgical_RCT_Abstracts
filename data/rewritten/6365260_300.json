A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial Comparing Partial and Circumferential Stapled Hemorrhoidopexy\n\nBackground: The long-term outcomes of partial stapled hemorrhoidopexy (PSH) versus circumferential stapled hemorrhoidopexy (CSH) for grade III/IV hemorrhoids remain unclear.\n\nMethods: This single-center, parallel-group, randomised, noninferiority trial was conducted at The Sixth Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-Sen University. A total of 300 patients with grade III/IV hemorrhoids were recruited between August 2011 and November 2013. Participants were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either PSH (n = 150) or CSH (n = 150) using blocked randomisation with a fixed block size of 4. Allocation was concealed using sealed envelopes. Patients and outcome assessors were blinded to the intervention. The primary outcome was the rate of recurrent prolapse at a median follow-up of 5 years, with a noninferiority margin of 3.75%. Secondary outcomes included postoperative pain, fecal urgency, anal continence, and complications.\n\nResults: The 5-year cumulative recurrence rate was 9% (95% CI, 4%–13%) for PSH and 12% (95% CI, 7%–17%) for CSH (p = 0.137), within the noninferiority margin. PSH was associated with significantly less postoperative pain (p < 0.001) and urgency (p = 0.001) compared to CSH. Anal continence scores worsened in both groups, but the increase was greater in CSH. Rectal stenosis occurred in 5% of CSH patients and none in PSH (p = 0.004). Adverse events were minimal, with no rectovaginal fistulas reported.\n\nInterpretation: PSH is noninferior to CSH for grade III/IV hemorrhoids, offering advantages in postoperative pain, urgency, and rectal stenosis.
