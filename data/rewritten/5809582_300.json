The HerniaSurge Group developed guidelines to standardize care, minimize complications, and improve patient outcomes, specifically targeting recurrence rates and chronic pain.\n\nMethods: An international expert group of surgeons and one anesthesiologist pain expert participated in this trial. Eligibility criteria included involvement in hernia-related research and experience in various hernia repair techniques. Evidence-based medicine training was provided, and 166 key questions were formulated. Comprehensive literature searches were conducted up to January 1, 2015, and July 1, 2015, for level 1 publications. Articles were scored using Oxford, SIGN, and Grade methodologies.\n\nResults: The guidelines comprise 136 statements and 88 recommendations, graded as \"strong\" or \"weak.\" Key recommendations include mesh repair as the first choice, either by open or laparo-endoscopic techniques. Surgical treatment should be tailored to the surgeon's expertise, patient characteristics, and local resources. The guidelines suggest that symptomatic groin hernias should be treated surgically, while asymptomatic male patients may be managed with \"watchful waiting.\" The incidence of chronic pain is 10-12%, decreasing over time.\n\nInterpretation: The HerniaSurge guidelines aim to improve groin hernia management globally by emphasizing shared decision-making, tailored surgical approaches, and the importance of surgeon expertise. The guidelines are expected to lead to better patient outcomes, more standardized care, and provide direction for future research. They have been endorsed by all five continental hernia societies, the International Endo Hernia Society, and the European Association for Endoscopic Surgery.",
