However, ethical concerns and translational limitations challenge their continued relevance.\n\nMethods: This review critically evaluates the contribution of animal models to complement-targeted therapies. We assess areas where animal studies have been indispensable for elucidating disease mechanisms and conducting preclinical evaluations, alongside instances where findings from animal models failed to translate successfully to human trials.\n\nResults: Animal models have been crucial in understanding disease mechanisms and developing complement therapeutics. However, notable differences in the complement system between animals and humans have led to translational challenges. Innovations in animal research, such as improved study design and method development, aim to enhance translatability to human biology.\n\nInterpretation: While animal models have significantly contributed to complement research, their role is evolving in the face of rising animal-free methods. These alternative tools supplement, rather than replace, animal-based approaches. Ethical concerns and translational limitations must be addressed to justify the continued use of animal models. Ultimately, every experiment must justify its choice of model, as all models are flawed and imperfect. Animal models remain valuable for exploring complement biology and disease mechanisms, but their use must be carefully considered and justified in relation to translation to human biology and disease.",
