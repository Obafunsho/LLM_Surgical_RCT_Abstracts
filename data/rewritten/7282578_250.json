A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Early Psychosocial Intervention in Orthopaedic Trauma Patients\n\nBackground: Orthopaedic trauma patients often face mobility impairment and psychosocial challenges. This study aimed to evaluate whether an early psychosocial intervention improves physical function outcomes compared to usual care.\n\nMethods: This randomised controlled trial was conducted at a single hospital between November 2015 and February 2017. Participants were 112 orthopaedic trauma patients aged 18-85 years, excluding those with traumatic brain injury, communication barriers, or severe psychiatric conditions. Patients were randomised to integrative care (n=56) or usual care (n=56) using a computer-generated sequence with allocation concealment. Integrative care included usual trauma care plus psychosocial and movement strategies. The primary outcome was physical function, measured objectively and subjectively at baseline, 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, and 1 year. Blinding was not applied.\n\nResults: At 6 months, no significant differences were found between groups in handgrip strength or Lower Extremity Gain Scale scores. Elbow flexion was 20° ± 10° greater in the integrative care group (p=0.05). Tampa Scale of Kinesiophobia scores showed no difference. Analysis was per-protocol with 99 participants (integrative care n=50, usual care n=49). No adverse events were reported.\n\nInterpretation: Early psychosocial intervention did not significantly alter physical function recovery trajectories compared to usual care. Further research is needed to enhance early recovery interventions.\n\nTrial registration: [Trial registration number]\n\nFunding: [Source of funding]",
