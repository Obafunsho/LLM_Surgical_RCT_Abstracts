A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of the CASPER Stent in Carotid Artery Stenting\n\nBackground: The dual-layer nitinol CASPER stent was designed to prevent plaque prolapse and reduce periprocedural stroke risk. This study aimed to evaluate its safety and effectiveness in patients at high or normal risk for carotid endarterectomy (CEA).\n\nMethods: This multicenter trial was conducted at 13 Japanese institutions between July 2016 and December 2017. Eligible patients had ≥50% symptomatic or ≥80% asymptomatic stenosis. The primary endpoint was the absence of major adverse events (MAEs) within 30 days and ipsilateral stroke within 1 year. The performance goal was set at 90.5%. Randomisation and blinding details were not applicable as this was a single-arm study.\n\nResults: A total of 140 patients underwent carotid artery stenting with the CASPER stent. The MAE rate was 1.4%, with two strokes reported. The non-MAE rate was 98.6% (95% CI 94.4% to 99.6%), surpassing the performance goal. Deployment success was 99.3%, target lesion revascularization (TLR) was 2.4%, and in-stent restenosis was 8.5%. Cerebrovascular events occurred in 7.2% of cases. The MAE rate was similar between high-risk and normal-risk CEA groups, with no significant difference due to the small number of events.\n\nInterpretation: The CASPER stent demonstrated a low MAE rate and high deployment success, indicating its safety and effectiveness in reducing periprocedural complications. The results suggest that the CASPER stent is a viable option for patients at both high and normal risk for CEA. Further studies are needed to confirm these findings in larger populations and to explore long-term outcomes.\n\nTrial registration: TCD-15152, UMIN000023562.\n\nFunding: Not specified.",
