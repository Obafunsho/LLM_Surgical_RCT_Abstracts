A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Collagenase Clostridium Histolyticum Injection for Adhesive Capsulitis\n\nBackground: Adhesive capsulitis management is often prolonged and painful, with limited evidence from controlled trials. This study investigates the efficacy of collagenase clostridium histolyticum (CCH) injections compared to physical therapy.\n\nMethods: This randomised controlled trial involved 60 patients with adhesive capsulitis, diagnosed by restricted active ROM of at least 60° in the affected shoulder. Participants were randomised to receive a single injection of 0.5 mL placebo or 0.145, 0.29, or 0.58 mg CCH. Randomisation was computer-generated, and allocation was concealed. Outcome assessors were blinded. The primary outcome was improvement in active forward flexion at 30 days. Follow-up extended to 60 months, with additional open-label CCH injections for non-responders.\n\nResults: Initial results showed no significant improvement in active ROM, passive ROM, or pain scores with a single CCH injection compared to placebo. However, in a subsequent study, CCH at 0.58 mg/1 mL and 0.58 mg/2 mL demonstrated superior improvement in active forward flexion compared to exercise alone (mean difference: 26° and 31°, p = 0.03 and p = 0.01, respectively). No adverse events were reported.\n\nInterpretation: Extraarticular CCH injections are well-tolerated and more effective than exercise therapy for adhesive capsulitis. These findings suggest potential benefits of CCH injections, warranting further FDA-regulated trials to confirm efficacy and safety.\n\nTrial registration: Not provided.\n\nFunding: Not disclosed.",
