This study investigates the Disability Rating Scale (DRS) as a predictor of favorable 6-month Glasgow Outcome Scale extended (GOS-E).\n\nMethods: This sub-analysis of the Epo Severe TBI Trial included 200 patients, randomised to receive erythropoietin or placebo. Eligibility criteria encompassed adults with severe TBI, and the study was conducted across multiple trauma centers. DRS was recorded weekly from weeks 1 to 4 post-injury, and GOS-E was evaluated at 6 months. Randomisation was computer-generated, with allocation concealment via sealed envelopes. Blinding was maintained for outcome assessors, patients, and clinicians. An intention-to-treat analysis was performed.\n\nResults: A total of 200 participants were randomised, with 100 assigned to each group. The model using baseline demographic and injury severity variables with week 1 DRS achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.82, which increased to 0.88 when including weekly DRS until week 4. No significant adverse events were reported in either group, with mild side effects occurring in 3% of the intervention group and 1% of the control group.\n\nInterpretation: DRS measured from weeks 1 to 4 post-injury may serve as a reliable predictor of favorable 6-month outcomes in severe TBI patients, supporting its use in clinical prognostication and as a surrogate endpoint in adaptive clinical trials.
