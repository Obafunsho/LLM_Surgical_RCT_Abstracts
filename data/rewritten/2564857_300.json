A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Doxycycline as an Adjunct to Endovascular Aneurysm Repair\n\nBackground: The durability of endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) is compromised by aortic degeneration mediated by matrix metalloproteases (MMP). This study assesses the impact of doxycycline, an MMP inhibitor, on EVAR outcomes.\n\nMethods: This double-blind, placebo-controlled trial randomised patients undergoing EVAR to doxycycline (100 mg twice daily) or placebo for 6 months. Conducted at [study setting], eligibility criteria included [participant eligibility criteria]. Randomisation was achieved using [randomisation method] with allocation concealment via [allocation concealment method]. Blinding encompassed patients, clinicians, and outcome assessors. The primary outcome was plasma MMP-9 levels at 6 months, with secondary outcomes including changes in aortic diameter and neck dilatation. Recruitment spanned from [start date] to [end date].\n\nResults: A total of 44 patients were randomised: 20 to doxycycline and 24 to placebo. Intention-to-treat analysis revealed a significant reduction in plasma MMP-9 in the doxycycline group at 6 months (−16.4±20.7%, P<0.05), contrasting with a non-significant increase in the placebo group (128.1±73.5%). Among patients with endoleaks, plasma MMP-9 increased in 83% of placebo patients compared to 14% of doxycycline patients (P<.03). Doxycycline treatment resulted in greater reductions in aortic diameter (−13.3±3.3% vs. −3.8±3.0%, P<.05) and decreased aortic neck dilatation in Excluder endografts. No adverse events were reported.\n\nInterpretation: Doxycycline effectively inhibits MMP release and enhances aortic stability post-EVAR, indicating its potential as an adjunctive therapy. These findings necessitate validation in larger cohorts. Trial registration: [registration number]. Funding: [source of funding].",
