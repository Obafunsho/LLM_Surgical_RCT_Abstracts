A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of AI-Enhanced VR Training in Vascular Surgery\n\nBackground: The transition from open to endovascular techniques in vascular surgery has reduced trainee exposure to open procedures. This study evaluates AI-enhanced VR training as a solution.\n\nMethods: This randomised controlled trial was conducted at a tertiary vascular surgery training center. Participants were vascular surgery trainees meeting eligibility criteria. The intervention group received AI-enhanced VR training, while the control group underwent traditional training. The primary outcome was technical skill proficiency, measured over a 6-month period. Randomisation was computer-generated, with allocation concealment via sealed envelopes. Outcome assessors were blinded.\n\nResults: A total of 200 participants were randomised: 100 to the intervention and 100 to the control group, between January 2020 and June 2021. Analysis included 98 in the intervention group and 97 in the control group, using an intention-to-treat approach. The intervention group showed a significant improvement in technical skills (mean difference = 5.2, 95% CI 3.1 to 7.3; p = 0.01). Adverse events were mild, with 3% in the intervention group and 1% in the control group experiencing minor side effects.\n\nInterpretation: AI-enhanced VR training significantly improves technical skills in vascular surgery trainees compared to traditional methods. Future curricula should integrate these technologies, focusing on ethical use and validation.\n\nTrial registration: NCT12345678\n\nFunding: Supported by the National Institute of Health.",
