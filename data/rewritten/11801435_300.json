A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Ultrasound-Guided Percutaneous Cryoneurolysis for Traumatic Rib Fractures\n\nBackground: Traumatic rib fractures are associated with significant pain and reduced inspiratory capacity. This study aimed to assess the effectiveness of ultrasound-guided percutaneous cryoneurolysis in enhancing analgesia and inspiratory volume.\n\nMethods: Conducted at the University of California-San Diego, this participant/observer-masked, randomised controlled trial included adults with one to six rib fractures. Participants were randomised to receive either active cryoneurolysis with a sham peripheral nerve block or sham cryoneurolysis with an active peripheral nerve block. Randomisation was stratified by laterality using sealed envelopes. The primary outcome was the maximum inspired volume measured with an incentive spirometer the day after the procedure.\n\nResults: From April 2020 to August 2023, 20 participants were randomised: 11 to the cryoneurolysis group and 9 to the peripheral nerve block group. The adjusted mean difference in maximum inspired volume was 793 ml greater in the cryoneurolysis group (95% CI, 273 to 1,312 ml; p = 0.005). Improvement from baseline was 1,000 ml for cryoneurolysis versus 300 ml for peripheral nerve block (p = 0.002). Average daily pain scores were consistently lower in the cryoneurolysis group throughout the first month. Total cumulative oxycodone consumption was 5 mg for cryoneurolysis compared to 45 mg for peripheral nerve block (p = 0.013). One participant in the cryoneurolysis group developed pneumonia, which was successfully treated with antibiotics.\n\nInterpretation: Cryoneurolysis significantly enhances inspiratory volume and reduces pain and opioid consumption following rib fractures. These preliminary results warrant further investigation in larger trials to confirm efficacy and safety.\n\nTrial registration: NCT04198662\n\nFunding: The trial was funded by Epimed International, which also provided the cryoneurolysis devices.",
