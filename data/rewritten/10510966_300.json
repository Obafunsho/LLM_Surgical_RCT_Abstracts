A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial on the Management of Left Ventricular Pseudoaneurysm\n\nBackground: Left ventricular pseudoaneurysm (LVP) is a rare, life-threatening condition resulting from myocardial rupture, often due to myocardial infarction, cardiac surgery, trauma, or infections. Accurate diagnosis and management are crucial to prevent complications such as rupture.\n\nMethods: This randomised controlled trial aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of advanced multimodality imaging in diagnosing and managing LVP. Conducted at a tertiary care hospital, the study included patients with suspected or diagnosed LVP. Participants were randomly assigned to either the intervention group, which received cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) and cardiac computed tomography (CCT) in addition to echocardiography, or the control group, which received standard echocardiography alone. Randomisation was computer-generated, and allocation was concealed using sealed envelopes. Outcome assessors were blinded to group assignments.\n\nResults: A total of 200 participants were randomised: 100 to the intervention group and 100 to the control group, with recruitment spanning from January 2020 to June 2021. The primary outcome was the accuracy of LVP diagnosis, assessed over a 6-month period. The intervention group demonstrated a significant improvement in diagnostic accuracy compared to the control group (mean difference = 15%, 95% CI 10% to 20%; p < 0.001). Adverse events were minimal, occurring in 3% of the intervention group and 1% of the control group, primarily mild gastrointestinal side-effects.\n\nInterpretation: The integration of CMR and CCT with echocardiography significantly enhances the diagnostic accuracy of LVP, offering a superior approach to traditional echocardiography alone. This strategy may lead to improved patient outcomes by enabling timely and appropriate management of LVP. Trial registration: NCT12345678.
