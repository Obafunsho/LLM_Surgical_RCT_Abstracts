A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Ultrasound-Guided Stellate Ganglion Blockade in Thoracoscopic Pulmonary Lobectomy\n\nBackground: Single-lung ventilation (SLV) in thoracic surgery can lead to hypoxemia due to intrapulmonary shunt and hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction. This study evaluates the efficacy of ultrasound-guided stellate ganglion blockade (SGB) in mitigating these effects.\n\nMethods: This prospective, randomised, double-blind trial was conducted at Quanzhou First Hospital affiliated with Fujian Medical University. Participants were adults aged 18-75 undergoing elective thoracoscopic pulmonary lobectomy. A total of 88 patients were randomised to receive either SGB (n=40) or standard care (n=39). The primary outcome was the change in oxygenation index (OI) and pulmonary shunt fraction (Qs/Qt) during SLV. Randomisation was computer-generated, and allocation was concealed using sealed envelopes. Blinding included patients, clinicians, and outcome assessors.\n\nResults: SGB significantly improved OI and reduced Qs/Qt compared to controls. The SGB group showed increased dynamic lung compliance and decreased mean airway pressure. Inflammatory markers IL-6 and IL-8 were significantly lower in the SGB group. No severe adverse events were reported.\n\nInterpretation: Ultrasound-guided SGB enhances respiratory mechanics and reduces inflammatory responses during SLV, suggesting a protective role in thoracic surgery. Further studies are needed to confirm these findings.\n\nTrial registration: Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (#ChiCTR2200063210).\n\nFunding: Not specified.",
