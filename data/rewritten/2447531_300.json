This study aimed to evaluate amniotic fluid (AF), heparin, and fetal red cell contamination in washed filtered salvaged maternal blood, comparing one versus two suction devices.\n\nMethods: In this exploratory trial, 34 patients undergoing elective Caesarean section at the Royal Cornwall Hospital were alternately assigned to Group 1 (n=17, one suction) or Group 2 (n=17, two suctions) over a 4-month period. The primary outcome was the reduction of AF, heparin, and fetal red cells post-filtration. Randomisation was alternate assignment, and no blinding was implemented.\n\nResults: Post-filtration, alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), squames cells, and heparin were significantly reduced (P<0.001) in both groups. Mean AFP levels were 2.58 IU/ml in Group 1 and 3.53 IU/ml in Group 2. Squames cells were nearly eliminated, with only two cases showing residual cells. Fetal red blood cells persisted, ranging from 0.13% to 4.35%. Group 1 had higher haemoglobin and haematocrit levels than Group 2, with lower white blood cell, AFP, and fetal red cell counts. No adverse events were reported.\n\nInterpretation: The study supports the use of cell salvage with a leucodepletion filter in obstetrics, showing minimal AF contamination. The findings suggest that one suction may be sufficient, and washed filtered blood from partially filled bowls should not be re-transfused. Further research is needed to confirm these findings and potentially revise guidelines for routine use in elective and emergency cases.\n\nFunding: Supported by an educational grant from Pall Medical.
