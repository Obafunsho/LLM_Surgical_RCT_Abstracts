A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Effect of Prophylactic Antibiotics on Intraoperative Cultures in Revision Arthroplasty: A Randomised Controlled Trial\n\nBackground: Preoperative antibiotics are essential for reducing periprosthetic joint infection (PJI) risk in primary total hip and knee arthroplasty (THA and TKA). However, their use in revision surgery is debated due to potential interference with intraoperative cultures.\n\nMethods: This multicenter, prospective randomised controlled trial was conducted at three centers, involving 65 patients with confirmed PJI after 37 TKAs and 28 THAs. Eligibility required a culture-positive aspiration and no antibiotics within two weeks prior. Participants were randomised using a computer-generated sequence, with allocation concealment, to receive prophylactic antibiotics either before skin incision or after obtaining a minimum of three sets of intraoperative cultures. The primary outcome was the concordance of intraoperative and preoperative cultures, assessed immediately post-surgery. Blinding was not applicable due to the nature of the intervention.\n\nResults: Of the 65 randomised, 34 received antibiotics before incision, and 31 after culture collection. Intraoperative cultures matched preoperative cultures in 28/34 (82%) of the pre-incision group and 25/31 (81%) of the post-culture group, demonstrating statistical equivalence (p = 0.0290). No adverse events were reported in either group, indicating the safety of the intervention.\n\nInterpretation: Administering prophylactic antibiotics before skin incision does not affect intraoperative culture results in revision arthroplasty. Given their benefits in preventing PJI, withholding antibiotics for fear of culture interference is unwarranted. This study supports the continued use of prophylactic antibiotics in revision surgeries to prevent PJI without compromising culture accuracy.\n\nTrial registration: [Trial registration number]\n\nFunding: [Source of funding]",
