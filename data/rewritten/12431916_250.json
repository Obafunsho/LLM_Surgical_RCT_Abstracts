A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Surgical Techniques for Choledocholithiasis\n\nBackground: Choledocholithiasis management lacks consensus, with various surgical techniques available. This study evaluates postoperative outcomes of open common bile duct (CBD) exploration, laparoscopic CBD exploration, and a combined endoscopic and surgical approach.\n\nMethods: This non-randomised prospective observational study was conducted in the Department of Surgery over two years, involving 50 patients diagnosed with CBD stones. Participants were selected based on specific eligibility criteria and underwent different interventions: ERCP followed by laparoscopic cholecystectomy, laparoscopic CBD exploration, or open CBD exploration. The primary outcome was stone clearance, assessed intraoperatively and postoperatively over a 12-month follow-up. Randomisation and blinding were not applicable.\n\nResults: The mean age was 53.88 years, with 54% women. Abdominal pain was the primary symptom (98%). Stone clearance rates were similar across methods, with a stricture and stone recurrence rate of 2.94%. The LCBDE group had a longer operative time (328 minutes) compared to ERCP+LC (149 minutes). Postoperative complications included pulmonary issues (22%) and wound infections (20%). No mortality was reported.\n\nInterpretation: Laparoscopic management of CBD stones requires expertise and has a steep learning curve. Open CBD exploration is effective for complex cases, especially after failed ERCP, despite higher short-term morbidity. The study highlights the need for skilled surgical techniques in managing choledocholithiasis.\n\nTrial registration: Not applicable.\n\nFunding: Not specified.",
