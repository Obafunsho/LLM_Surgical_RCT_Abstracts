A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial on the Impact of a Standardized Operating Procedure and Educational Program on Adherence to Intraoperative Lung Protective Ventilation\n\nBackground: Adherence to lung-protective ventilation (LPV) is crucial for reducing perioperative pulmonary complications, yet global adherence remains low. This study assesses the impact of a standardized operating procedure (SOP) enhanced with an educational program on adherence to intraoperative lung protective ventilation (IOLPV).\n\nMethods: Conducted at Masaryk Hospital, Czech Republic, from April 20 to July 18, 2023, this prospective, pre-post interventional study involved 164 patients undergoing general anesthesia. Eligibility criteria included adult patients scheduled for non-thoracic surgery. The intervention comprised an SOP and a mandatory educational program. The primary outcome was adherence to the IOLPV bundle, assessed over one month pre- and post-intervention. Randomization and blinding were not applicable.\n\nResults: A total of 164 patients were analyzed (Group A: 82 pre-intervention, Group B: 82 post-intervention). Adherence to the IOLPV bundle significantly increased in Group B (Group A: 4%, Group B: 24%; p < 0.001). The frequency of recruitment maneuvers was higher in Group B (Group A: 11, Group B: 35; p < 0.001). Mean positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) was significantly greater in Group B (Group A: 6.6 mbar, Group B: 7.8 mbar; p < 0.001), resulting in more cases meeting recommended PEEP levels (Group A: 22, Group B: 49; p < 0.001). No significant differences were observed in plateau pressure, driving pressure, tidal volume, or breathing frequency. No adverse events were reported.\n\nInterpretation: The SOP and educational program effectively increased adherence to IOLPV, suggesting this approach may enhance clinical practice.\n\nTrial registration: NCT05831683.\n\nFunding: Not specified.",
