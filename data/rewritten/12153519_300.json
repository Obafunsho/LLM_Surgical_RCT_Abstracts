A 300-word version\n\nTitle: A Prospective Cohort Study on Walking Performance in Colorectal Cancer Surgery\n\nBackground: Colorectal cancer is a major health concern worldwide, with surgery being the primary curative approach. This study aims to evaluate the impact of preoperative and postoperative walking performance in colorectal cancer patients undergoing surgery.\n\nMethods: Conducted at the Sestre Milosrdnice University Hospital Centre, Zagreb, Croatia, from March 2022 to September 2023, this prospective cohort study included colorectal cancer patients scheduled for elective open or laparoscopic abdominal surgery. Exclusion criteria encompassed severe cardiorespiratory, musculoskeletal, or neurologic conditions. Participants completed the EORTC QLQ-C30 and QoR 15 questionnaires and performed a 6-minute walk test (6MWT) 2 days before and 7 days after surgery.\n\nResults: Out of 84 assessed patients, 72 (mean age 62.48 years) were included in the final analysis. Postoperative walking performance showed a significant increase in average heart rate (65 bpm pre-surgery vs. 99 bpm post-surgery, p = 0.008). Gender differences were observed in walking distance (F = 4.99, p = 0.02), and age influenced the number of steps (F = 2.90, p = 0.02). Body mass index significantly affected average (F = 5.72, p = 0.00) and maximum heart rate (F = 2.52, p = 0.04).\n\nInterpretation: The study demonstrates increased heart rates during the 6MWT post-surgery, especially in overweight and obese patients. These findings underscore the importance of personalized postoperative rehabilitation programs to enhance recovery. The study's limitations include the use of a wearable device with limited validation in surgical patients and a relatively small sample size. Future research should consider more accurate heart rate measurement tools and larger sample sizes to validate these findings.",
