The primary outcome was PNI, defined as >40% elevation in current perception threshold (CPT) from preoperative data. CPT was measured at 6 points on each leg preoperatively and at 1 week, 1 month, and 6 months postoperatively. Randomisation and allocation concealment methods were not applicable as this was not a randomised trial. Blinding was not implemented.\n\nResults: Significant CPT elevation was observed at the knee joint level (P = 0.01) and upper portion of the lower leg (P = 0.008) 1 week postoperatively. CPT decreased after 1 month and returned to baseline after 6 months. PNI occurred in 52% and 36% of patients at the knee joint level and upper portion of the lower leg, respectively. Microphlebectomy was associated with PNI (P <0.01). No major complications such as severe endovenous heat-induced thrombosis or major bleeding were reported. The study was conducted in compliance with institutional policies and the Helsinki Declaration, with approval from the institutional review board (No. 581-2-46).\n\nInterpretation: Although VV surgery using EVLA is less invasive, the occurrence of transient PNI in the early postoperative period should be noted, particularly when microphlebectomy is performed. Further studies are necessary to confirm these findings and explore potential preventive measures.\n\nTrial registration: Not provided.\n\nFunding: None.",
