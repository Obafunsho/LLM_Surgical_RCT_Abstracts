A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of a Simulation-Based Curriculum for Open Vascular Surgical Skills\n\nBackground: The rise of endovascular surgery has reduced opportunities for surgical trainees to practice open vascular techniques. This study evaluates a simulation-based curriculum designed to bridge this gap.\n\nMethods: This randomised controlled trial was conducted at a large academic medical center. Second-year surgery residents were eligible to participate. Participants were randomised into two groups: the intervention group received a six-session open vascular skills curriculum, while the control group received standard training. The primary outcome was the improvement in technical skills, measured using the Objective Structured Assessment of Technical Skills (OSATS) form during the fifth and sixth sessions. Randomisation was computer-generated, and allocation was concealed. Blinding was not feasible due to the nature of the intervention.\n\nResults: A total of 101 residents were randomised, with 50 in the intervention group and 51 in the control group. The intervention group showed a significant improvement in OSATS scores, with a median score of 26.5 (interquartile range: 24–29) compared to the control group. No adverse events were reported. The analysis was conducted on an intention-to-treat basis.\n\nInterpretation: The simulation-based curriculum significantly improved open vascular surgical skills among second-year surgery residents. This curriculum provides a valuable training tool in an increasingly demanding operative setting.\n\nTrial registration: Not applicable.\n\nFunding: The study was supported by institutional resources.",
