A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Tranexamic Acid in Postpartum Haemorrhage\n\nBackground: The optimal dose of tranexamic acid (TXA) to inhibit hyperfibrinolysis in postpartum haemorrhage (PPH) is unclear. This study aimed to determine the dose–effect relationship for two regimens of intravenous TXA versus placebo.\n\nMethods: In this double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomised trial, women experiencing PPH during Caesarean delivery were randomised to receive placebo (n=57), TXA 0.5 g (n=51), or TXA 1 g (n=53) across eight centres in France from March 2016 to December 2019. The primary outcome was the difference in the increase over baseline in plasma D-dimer level 120 min after infusion. Randomisation was computer-generated, and allocation was concealed. Blinding included patients, clinicians, and outcome assessors. The sample size was calculated to detect a 30% difference in D-dimer levels between groups.\n\nResults: In the placebo group, hyperfibrinolysis was evidenced by a mean increase over baseline of 93% for D-dimer level at 120 min. A dose of TXA 1 g was associated with smaller increases over baseline (D-dimers: 38%, p=0.003 vs placebo). The 0.5 g dose was less potent, with non-significant reductions (D-dimers: 58%, p=0.06 vs placebo). Adverse events, such as nausea and vomiting, were more frequent in the 1 g group but not severe. No thrombotic events or seizures were reported.\n\nInterpretation: Fibrinolytic activation was significantly inhibited by a dose of intravenous TXA 1 g but not 0.5 g. These findings suggest that a 1 g dose is necessary for effective inhibition of hyperfibrinolysis in PPH. Pharmacokinetic–pharmacodynamic modelling of these data might identify the best pharmacodynamic monitoring criteria and the optimal TXA dosing regimen for treatment of PPH.\n\nTrial registration: NCT 02797119.\n\nFunding: The study was funded by independent agencies with no influence on the study design or reporting.",
