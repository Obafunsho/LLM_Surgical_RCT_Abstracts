A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial Comparing Sclerotherapy and Intralesional Excision for Aneurysmal Bone Cysts\n\nBackground: This study evaluates the efficacy and safety of percutaneous repetitive sclerotherapy using polidocanol versus intralesional excision (extended curettage with a high-speed burr) and bone grafting in treating aneurysmal bone cysts.\n\nMethods: In this randomised controlled trial, 94 patients with aneurysmal bone cysts were randomly assigned to two groups: Group 1 received sclerotherapy, and Group 2 underwent intralesional excision and bone grafting. The primary outcome was the healing rate, assessed over a minimum follow-up of 3.2 years. Secondary outcomes included pain relief, time to healing and recurrence, hospital stay, and the Enneking functional score. Randomisation was performed using a computer-generated sequence, and allocation was concealed. Outcome assessors were blinded to group assignments.\n\nResults: Ninety-one patients were analysed (45 in Group 1 and 46 in Group 2) using an intention-to-treat approach. Healing was achieved in 93.3% of Group 1 and 84.8% of Group 2. Group 1 experienced minor complications, while Group 2 had three deep infections, five superficial infections, and two growth disturbances. Functional outcomes and hospital burden were worse in Group 2.\n\nInterpretation: Sclerotherapy with polidocanol is a minimally invasive and safer alternative to intralesional excision for aneurysmal bone cysts, with similar healing rates but fewer complications. Larger studies are needed to confirm these findings.\n\nTrial registration: [Trial registration number]\n\nFunding: [Source of funding]",
