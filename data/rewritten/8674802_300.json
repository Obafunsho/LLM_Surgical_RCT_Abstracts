A 300-word version\n\nTitle: A Randomised Controlled Trial of a Multimodal Delirium Prevention Intervention in Older Surgical Patients\n\nBackground: Delirium is a common complication in elderly patients undergoing elective surgery, leading to worsened outcomes. This study investigates the efficacy of a multifaceted intervention in reducing postoperative delirium incidence and duration.\n\nMethods: Conducted as a stepped-wedge cluster randomised trial across five German tertiary medical centers, the study included 1470 patients aged 70 years and older undergoing elective orthopedic, general, or cardiac surgery from November 2017 to April 2019. The intervention comprised structured delirium education for caregivers and daily assessment of patient delirium risk factors, with tailored prevention strategies. Randomisation was computer-generated, and allocation was concealed. Outcome assessors and patients were blinded. The primary outcome was postoperative delirium incidence, assessed daily for seven days post-surgery.\n\nResults: Of 1470 patients, 763 (51.9%) were male, with a median age of 77 years. The intervention group showed a reduction in delirium incidence (odds ratio, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.77-0.98; P = .02) and percentage of days with delirium (5.3% vs 6.9%; P = .03). Significant effects were noted in orthopedic and abdominal surgeries (odds ratio, 0.59; 95% CI, 0.35-0.99; P = .047), but not in cardiac surgeries. No adverse events were reported.\n\nInterpretation: The multifaceted intervention effectively reduced postoperative delirium in older patients undergoing elective non-cardiac surgeries, suggesting its potential to improve surgical outcomes in this population.
