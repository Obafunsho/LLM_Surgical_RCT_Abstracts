A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial on the Effects of Intravenous Anesthetics on Ischemia-Reperfusion Injury\n\nBackground: This study investigates the protective effects of intravenous anesthetics on ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) in both animal and clinical settings.\n\nMethods: A randomised controlled trial was conducted with the unit of randomisation being individual participants. The sample size was calculated based on expected effect sizes from previous studies. Participants were eligible if they were undergoing surgical procedures with potential IRI. The study was conducted in a hospital setting. The intervention involved administering intravenous anesthetics, with a control group receiving standard care. Randomisation was performed using a computer-generated sequence, and allocation was concealed using sealed envelopes. Blinding was applied to outcome assessors, patients, and clinicians.\n\nResults: The primary outcome was the reduction in tissue injury, measured over a 24-hour period post-intervention. A total of 200 participants were randomised: 100 to the intervention group and 100 to the control group. Analysis was conducted on 98 participants in the intervention group and 97 in the control group using an intention-to-treat approach. The intervention group showed a significant reduction in tissue injury (mean difference = 5.2, 95% CI 3.1 to 7.3; p = 0.01). Adverse events were mild and occurred in 3% of the intervention group and 1% of the control group.\n\nTrial registration: [Trial registration number]\n\nFunding: The study was funded by [Funding source].",
