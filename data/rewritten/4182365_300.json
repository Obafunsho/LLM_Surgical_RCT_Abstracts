Eligibility criteria included adults undergoing primary knee arthroplasty. The primary outcome was postoperative pain, evaluated using the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) and analgesic consumption over 6 weeks. Secondary outcomes were range of motion (ROM), swelling, and blood loss. Randomisation was computer-generated, with allocation concealment. Blinding details were not specified. A priori sample size calculation indicated 50 subjects per group were needed to detect a 2-point VAS difference with 80% power.\n\nResults: Analysis included 100 patients (50 per group). No significant differences were found in VAS scores or analgesic use between groups. The advanced cryotherapy group exhibited reduced flexion at 6 weeks (114° vs. 120°). No adverse events were reported.\n\nInterpretation: Advanced cryotherapy did not provide superior early recovery outcomes compared to cold packs. The reduced flexion in the cryotherapy group may be due to knee immobilization during treatment. Larger studies are necessary to explore these findings further. Trial registration and funding information were not disclosed.",
