A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Gastric Partitioning versus Gastrojejunostomy for Malignant Gastric Outlet Obstruction\n\nBackground: This randomised controlled trial compared gastric partitioning with gastrojejunostomy for managing gastric outlet obstruction due to unresectable distal gastric tumours.\n\nMethods: Conducted at a single centre, patients aged 18-85 with obstructive, unresectable distal gastric adenocarcinoma were randomised. The primary outcome was the acceptance of a full diet (GOOS 3) at discharge. Randomisation was computer-generated, with allocation concealed until after consent. The trial was open-label, with no blinding of participants or clinicians.\n\nResults: From August 2013 to April 2020, 90 patients were randomised: 46 to gastrojejunostomy and 44 to gastric partitioning. After exclusions, 25 in the gastrojejunostomy group and 27 in the partitioning group were analysed per-protocol. Acceptance of a normal diet was higher in the partitioning group (96% vs. 72%; p = 0.022). No significant differences were observed in surgery duration, hospital stay, postoperative complications, or mortality rates. The partitioning group had more frequent red blood cell transfusions (81% vs. 52%; p = 0.024). Multivariable analysis showed that inability to eat a full diet (p = 0.035) and absence of palliative chemotherapy (p = 0.001) were associated with worse survival.\n\nInterpretation: Gastric partitioning improved oral diet acceptance compared to gastrojejunostomy, with no difference in postoperative complications or long-term survival.\n\nTrial registration: NCT02065803, clinicaltrials.gov\n\nFunding: Not specified.",
