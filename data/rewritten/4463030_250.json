A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of ABThera vs. Barker's Vacuum Pack in Reducing Systemic Inflammation\n\nBackground: Excessive systemic inflammation after abdominal injury or intra-abdominal sepsis is linked to poor outcomes. This study aimed to determine if the ABThera temporary abdominal closure device reduces systemic inflammation compared to Barker's vacuum pack.\n\nMethods: This single-center, parallel-group randomised controlled trial was conducted at Foothills Medical Centre, Calgary, Canada. Forty-five adults undergoing abbreviated laparotomy were randomised 1:1 to ABThera (n=23) or Barker's vacuum pack (n=22) between September 29, 2011, and December 9, 2012. The primary outcome was the difference in plasma IL-6 concentration at 24 and 48 hours post-application. Randomisation was computer-generated with allocation concealment via a dedicated website. Outcome assessors were blinded.\n\nResults: There was no significant difference in plasma IL-6 concentrations at 24 (p=0.52) or 48 hours (p=0.82) between groups. The 90-day mortality was lower in the ABThera group (HR 0.32, 95% CI 0.11–0.93, p=0.04). No significant differences were observed in adverse events, including enterocutaneous fistula formation and intra-abdominal hypertension.\n\nInterpretation: The ABThera device was associated with improved 90-day survival but did not significantly affect systemic inflammation markers or adverse events compared to Barker's vacuum pack. Further research is needed to confirm these findings.\n\nTrial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01355094.\n\nFunding: The trial was funded by institutional grants.",
