Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to IBBR with or without ADM. The primary outcome was the number of reoperations within 6 months. Secondary outcomes included HRQoL and cosmetic outcomes, evaluated using EORTC-QLQC30, QLQ-BR23, and QLQ-BRR26 questionnaires. Randomisation was computer-generated, and allocation was concealed until baseline questionnaires were completed. The study was open-label.\n\nResults: Between April 2014 and May 2017, 135 women were randomised: 65 to the ADM group and 70 to the control group. Analysis included 64 in the ADM group and 65 in the control group. At 6 months, HRQoL scores were similar between groups. Cosmetic outcomes showed small differences favoring ADM in two subscales: cosmetic outcome (mean difference 8.66, 95% CI 0.46 to 16.86; p = 0.041) and problems finding a well-fitting bra (mean difference -13.21, 95% CI -25.54 to -0.89; p = 0.038). Adverse events requiring reoperation were more frequent in the ADM group.\n\nInterpretation: IBBR with ADM did not significantly improve HRQoL compared to IBBR without ADM. While minor cosmetic benefits were observed with ADM, the majority of cosmetic items showed no significant difference between treatments at 6 months. The trial highlights the need for further research to evaluate the long-term benefits and risks of ADM in IBBR. Trial registration: NCT02061527. Funding: Not specified.",
