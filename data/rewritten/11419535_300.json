A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Personalized Pain Education and Management in Orthopaedic Trauma: A Randomised Controlled Trial\n\nBackground: This randomised controlled trial assessed the impact of personalized pain education and management delivered by paraprofessional coaches on pain-related outcomes, opioid consumption, and patient-reported outcomes in patients with orthopaedic trauma.\n\nMethods: Conducted between February 2021 and September 2022, 212 patients were randomised to either the intervention group (104 patients) or the control group (108 patients). The intervention consisted of personalized pain education and management by coaches, while the control group received standard written discharge instructions. The primary outcome was the mean pain score at 12 weeks, measured using the pain numeric rating scale. Randomisation was performed using a computer-generated sequence, with allocation concealment. Blinding details were not provided. Analysis included 72 intervention and 57 control patients, following a per-protocol approach.\n\nResults: There was no significant difference in mean pain scores at 12 weeks between the intervention and control groups. The odds ratio for achieving the minimum clinically important difference in pain scores was 2.2 (95% CI 0.9 to 5.3; p = 0.08). No differences were observed in opioid consumption or patient-reported outcomes, including PROMIS Physical Function, Sleep Disturbance, and Pain Interference scores. Adverse events were not reported.\n\nInterpretation: The intervention of personalized pain education and management by coaches did not result in significant improvements in pain outcomes, opioid use, or patient-reported outcomes compared to standard care. Further research is warranted to explore the potential benefits of this approach in diverse patient populations at risk for poor postoperative outcomes.\n\nTrial registration: Not provided.\n\nFunding: Not specified.",
