A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Tranexamic Acid Administration Routes in Total Knee Arthroplasty\n\nBackground: This randomised controlled trial aimed to compare the efficacy of tranexamic acid in reducing total blood loss and allogeneic transfusion rates among different administration routes in total knee arthroplasty (TKA).\n\nMethods: A total of 376 patients undergoing TKA between March 2014 and March 2015 were randomised into four groups: IV only, IA only, low-dose combined (IV + IA injection of 1 g), and high-dose combined (IV + IA injection of 2 g). Randomisation was performed using a computer-generated sequence with allocation concealment. The primary outcome was total blood loss, calculated using estimated total body blood volume and hemoglobin loss. Secondary outcomes included allogeneic transfusion rate, symptomatic venous thromboembolism (VTE), and wound complications. Blinding was applied to outcome assessors.\n\nResults: The high- and low-dose combined groups and the IA-only group had significantly lower total blood loss compared to the IV-only group (mean differences = 199 mL [95% CI, 116–283 mL], p < 0.001; 121 mL [95% CI, 38–205 mL], p = 0.001; 131 mL [95% CI, 47–214 mL], p < 0.001). No allogeneic transfusions were required. One patient in the IV-only group developed a symptomatic pulmonary embolism. Wound complications were similar across groups.\n\nInterpretation: IA tranexamic acid administration reduces blood loss more effectively than IV use alone in TKA. Further studies are needed to confirm the safety of this route. Trial registration: [Trial registration number]. Funding: [Source of funding].",
