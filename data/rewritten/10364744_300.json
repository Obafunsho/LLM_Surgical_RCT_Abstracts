A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Prucalopride for Postoperative Ileus in Elective Colorectal Surgery\n\nBackground: Postoperative ileus and prolonged postoperative ileus (PPOI) delay recovery after colorectal surgery. This study assessed the effect of prucalopride, a selective serotonin-4-receptor agonist, on gut motility.\n\nMethods: This multicentre, double-blind, parallel, placebo-controlled randomised trial was conducted at Auckland City Hospital and Dunedin City Hospital, New Zealand, from October 2017 to May 2020. Eligible patients were adults undergoing elective colorectal resection, excluding those with inflammatory bowel disease or planned ileostomy. Participants were randomised 1:1 to receive 2 mg prucalopride or placebo, administered 2 hours before surgery and daily for up to 6 days postoperatively. The primary outcome was time to GI-2, defined as passage of stool and tolerance of diet. Randomisation was computer-generated, with allocation concealment by an external pharmacy. All participants, clinicians, and outcome assessors were blinded.\n\nResults: A total of 148 patients were randomised, 74 per group, and analysed using an intention-to-treat approach. There was no significant difference in median time to GI-2 between prucalopride and placebo groups: 3.5 versus 4 days (P = 0.124). Prucalopride improved median time to stool passage (3 versus 4 days; P = 0.027) but not diet tolerance or hospital stay. In laparoscopic surgery patients, prucalopride reduced median time to GI-2 (3 versus 4 days; P = 0.012). Adverse events were similar between groups, with no significant differences in complications or readmission rates.\n\nInterpretation: Prucalopride did not significantly improve overall recovery of gut function after elective colorectal surgery, although it showed potential benefits in laparoscopic procedures. Further research is needed to explore its role in minimally invasive surgery. Trial registration: NCT02947269. Funding: Not specified.",
