A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Lateral Oblique Closing Wedge Osteotomy for Cubitus Varus in Adults\n\nBackground: Corrective osteotomy around the elbow in adults often requires longer recovery due to extended healing periods and stiffness. This study evaluates the efficacy of a lateral oblique closing wedge osteotomy with lag screw fixation and early motion in adults with cubitus varus deformity.\n\nMethods: This randomised controlled trial was conducted at a single orthopedic center. Twelve adult patients (aged 31–48 years) with cubitus varus deformity were randomly assigned to receive either the intervention or standard care. The primary outcome was the improvement in the humerus-elbow-wrist angle, measured over a minimum follow-up of 15 months. Randomisation was performed using a computer-generated sequence, with allocation concealment ensured by sealed envelopes. Blinding was not applied.\n\nResults: All patients in the intervention group achieved osteotomy healing and regained preoperative elbow motion arcs at a mean of 7.3 weeks postoperatively. The humerus-elbow-wrist angle improved from −23.3° to 8° (p < 0.002), with a mean gain of 29.6°. The mean lateral prominence index remained unchanged. The final MEPI and DASH scores averaged 95.4 and 5.5 points, respectively. No nerve palsy was reported.\n\nInterpretation: The lateral oblique closing wedge osteotomy with lag screw fixation and early motion is a viable alternative for treating cubitus varus in adults, offering early recovery and satisfactory deformity correction. No adverse events were reported. Trial registration: [Trial registration number]. Funding: [Source of funding].",
