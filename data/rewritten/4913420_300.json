A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Human Fibrinogen Concentrate in Aortic Surgery\n\nBackground: This randomised controlled trial assessed the haemostatic benefits of single-dose human fibrinogen concentrate (FCH) in complex cardiovascular surgery, specifically elective aortic surgery requiring cardiopulmonary bypass.\n\nMethods: Patients were randomly assigned to receive FCH or placebo using a computer-generated sequence, with allocation concealed via sealed envelopes. Conducted across 34 centres, the trial included patients with a 5 min bleeding mass of 60–250 g post-bypass and surgical haemostasis. The primary outcome was the number of allogeneic blood product units transfused within 24 hours. Blinding was applied to patients, clinicians, and outcome assessors. Sample size was calculated to detect a clinically significant difference in transfusion requirements.\n\nResults: From January 2010 to December 2012, 519 patients were randomised, 260 to FCH and 259 to placebo. Of these, 152 met the criteria for study medication. Median pretreatment 5 min bleeding mass was 107 g in the FCH group and 91 g in the placebo group. The FCH group received more blood products (median 5.0 units) compared to placebo (median 3.0 units), p = 0.026. Fewer patients in the FCH group avoided transfusion (15.4%) compared to placebo (28.4%), p = 0.047. Adverse events were comparable between groups, with no significant differences in frequency or severity.\n\nInterpretation: Contrary to previous studies, FCH was associated with increased transfusion requirements, suggesting it may not be effective in this setting. Factors such as low bleeding rates, normal-range plasma fibrinogen concentrations before medication, and variability in adherence to the transfusion algorithm may have influenced results.
