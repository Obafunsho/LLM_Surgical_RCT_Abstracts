A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of DACC-Coated vs. Alginate Dressings for Pilonidal Sinus Wound Healing\n\nBackground: Pilonidal sinus disease commonly affects young adults, with surgical excision and secondary intention healing as standard management. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of dialkylcarbamoyl chloride (DACC)-coated dressings compared to alginate dressings in wound healing.\n\nMethods: This multicentre, open-label randomised controlled trial was conducted in four French hospitals from December 2013 to September 2017. A total of 246 patients undergoing pilonidal sinus surgery were randomised to receive either DACC-coated or alginate dressings postoperatively. The primary outcome was the proportion of wounds healed at 75 days. Randomisation was computer-generated, with allocation concealment via telephone. Blinding was not feasible for patients or clinicians.\n\nResults: In per-protocol analysis, 78 of 103 patients (75.7%) in the DACC group and 58 of 97 (60%) in the alginate group had healed wounds at 75 days (odds ratio 2.55, 95% CI 1.12 to 5.92; P = 0.023). Adverse events in the alginate group included severe pain, hyperglycaemia, pregnancy, and hyperalgic inflammatory granulation. No significant differences were observed in patient assessments of dressing comfort or pain.\n\nInterpretation: DACC-coated dressings significantly improved wound healing compared to alginate dressings, although the preplanned 20% improvement was not achieved. The study highlights the potential of DACC-coated dressings in enhancing wound healing for pilonidal sinus surgery. Trial registration: NCT02011802.\n\nFunding: Not specified.",
