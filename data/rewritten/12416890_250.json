This study evaluated whether a higher-than-standard CPB flow improves renal blood flow, oxygen demand–supply relationship, and function, and reduces tubular injury.\n\nMethods: In this nonblinded, parallel-arm trial, 36 adult patients undergoing cardiac surgery at a Swedish hospital were randomised to receive either high flow (2.9 l · min–1 · m–2, n = 19) or standard flow (2.4 l · min–1 · m–2, n = 17) during CPB. The primary outcome was renal blood flow, measured by para-aminohippuric acid clearance, over 60 minutes. Randomisation was stratified by eGFR and left ventricular ejection fraction using an online tool. No blinding was applied.\n\nResults: High flow increased systemic oxygen delivery (100 [95% CI, 60 to 141] vs. 31 [1.9 to 65] ml · min–1 · m–2; P < 0.001) and maintained target mean arterial pressure at a lower norepinephrine dose (0.03 [–0.01 to 0.06] vs. 0.10 [0.02 to 0.19] µg · kg–1 · min–1; P = 0.048). No differences in renal blood flow or oxygen extraction were observed. Glomerular filtration rate increased in the high-flow group (6.4 [1.9 to 10.9] ml · min–1 · 1.73 m–2; P = 0.044). Tubular injury marker release was lower in the high-flow group (P = 0.049). No perfusion-related adverse events occurred.\n\nTrial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT272790.\n\nFunding: Supported by Swedish State, ALF-agreement, Swedish Heart and Lung Foundation, and Gothenburg Society of Medicine.",
