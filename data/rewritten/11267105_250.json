A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial Comparing Dynamic Needle Tip Positioning and Long-Axis In-Plane Techniques for Internal Jugular Vein Cannulation\n\nBackground: Internal jugular vein (IJV) cannulation is a routine procedure in operating rooms and critical care units. This study compares the first-pass success rate of IJV cannulation using the dynamic needle tip positioning (DNTP) technique versus the long-axis in-plane (LAIP) approach.\n\nMethods: This randomised controlled trial was conducted at AIIMS, Raipur, with 100 patients aged 18-70 years undergoing elective surgery requiring IJV cannulation. Participants were randomly assigned to either the DNTP group (n=50) or the LAIP group (n=50) using a computer-generated random number table. The primary outcome was the first-pass success rate, measured immediately after the procedure. Secondary outcomes included cannulation time, number of skin punctures, and complications. Randomisation was concealed using opaque envelopes, and the outcome assessors were blinded.\n\nResults: The first-pass success rate was significantly higher in the DNTP group (96%) compared to the LAIP group (76%), with a relative risk of 1.67 (95% CI, 0.039-0.707; p=0.008). Cannulation time was shorter in the DNTP group (116.98 ± 22.90 seconds) versus the LAIP group (213.04 ± 52.08 seconds; p<0.001). No complications such as pneumothorax or hematoma were observed in either group.\n\nInterpretation: The DNTP technique significantly improves the first-pass success rate and reduces cannulation time compared to the LAIP technique. The trial was registered under CTRI/2022/02/039907 and funded by AIIMS, Raipur.",
