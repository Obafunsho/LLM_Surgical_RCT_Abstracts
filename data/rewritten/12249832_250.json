A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Feasibility of Systemic Lidocaine Infusion in Surgical ICU: A Pilot Study\n\nBackground: Systemic lidocaine infusion may offer an opioid-sparing analgesic strategy for critically ill surgical patients, but data on its feasibility and safety are limited.\n\nMethods: This single-center, prospective, single-arm pilot trial was conducted at the surgical ICU of Houston Methodist Hospital. Twelve adult patients admitted after open abdominal surgery were enrolled. A low-dose lidocaine infusion (10–30 mcg/kg/min) was initiated within 1 hour of ICU admission. The primary outcome was feasibility, assessed through recruitment, retention, and withdrawal rates over a 6-month period. Safety outcomes included adverse events and serum lidocaine levels.\n\nResults: Eighteen participants were screened, with 12 completing the study, resulting in a 66.7% retention rate. No serious adverse events were reported. Dizziness and hypertension were the most common adverse events, affecting 16.7% of patients each. Four patients (33%) had elevated lidocaine levels (>5 mcg/mL) without clinical toxicity. Opioid requirements decreased from 22.6 MMEs on postoperative day 0 to 2.5 on day 3. Pain scores decreased by 1.09 units per day (β = −1.09; 95% CI: −1.82 to −0.36; p = 0.003).\n\nInterpretation: The study demonstrates the feasibility of a larger RCT to evaluate systemic lidocaine infusion in surgical ICUs, with minor adjustments to eligibility criteria and improved multidisciplinary collaboration.
