A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Preoperative Enema in Anal Surgery: A Randomised Controlled Trial\n\nBackground: This randomised controlled trial aimed to evaluate the efficacy of preoperative enemas in anal surgeries, specifically haemorrhoidal and anal fistula procedures.\n\nMethods: Conducted at Taipei Medical University Shuang-Ho Hospital, Taiwan, between November 2022 and August 2023, the study included adults aged 20–85 years with grade III or IV haemorrhoids or anal fistulas. Participants were randomly assigned to receive either a preoperative enema (n=133) or no enema (n=133). Randomisation was computer-generated with allocation concealment via sealed envelopes. Surgeons and data analysts were blinded. The primary outcome was postoperative pain measured by the visual analogue scale (VAS) from day 0 to day 7. Secondary outcomes included postoperative complications such as infection, bleeding, and urinary retention.\n\nResults: Of the 266 patients analysed, no significant differences were found in VAS scores, analgesic consumption, or complications between groups. Subgroup analysis showed no significant differences for stapled haemorrhoidopexy and anal fistula surgeries. However, in Milligan–Morgan haemorrhoidectomy, the control group had significantly higher VAS scores on days 2 to 4 (P < 0.05).\n\nInterpretation: Preoperative enemas did not provide additional benefits or reduce complications in anal surgeries, except for reduced pain in Milligan–Morgan haemorrhoidectomy. The routine use of enemas can be omitted, particularly in stapled haemorrhoidopexy and anal fistula surgeries.\n\nTrial registration: NCT05602987\n\nFunding: Not specified.",
