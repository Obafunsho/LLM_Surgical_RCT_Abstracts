This study aimed to elucidate its mechanism of action to develop targeted therapies for cardiac surgery.\n\nMethods: This randomised controlled trial involved isolated mouse myocytes and hearts. Myocytes were exposed to Tyrode's solution, hyperkalemic cardioplegia (CPG) ± diazoxide, ± VU591 (Kir1.1 inhibitor), and Tyrode's solution again. Isolated hearts from wild-type, SUR1(−/−), and cardiac knockout renal outer medullary potassium (ROMK) mice were subjected to CPG ± diazoxide before global ischemia and reperfusion. Randomisation was performed using a computer-generated sequence, and allocation was concealed. Investigators were blinded to group assignments. Sample size calculations were based on detecting a 5% ± 4% difference with 80% power.\n\nResults: Myocyte contractility was reduced by CPG but preserved by diazoxide. VU591 negated diazoxide's effect in myocytes. In hearts, diazoxide improved left ventricular function post-ischemia in all mouse types. No adverse events were reported. The primary outcome was measured over a 20-minute period for myocytes and a 90-minute ischemia with 30-minute reperfusion for hearts.\n\nInterpretation: The study indicates that SUR1 and ROMK are not involved in diazoxide-mediated cardioprotection, suggesting independent mechanisms in myocytes and hearts. These findings may guide the development of targeted pharmacologic therapies for myocardial protection during cardiac surgery.\n\nTrial registration: Not provided.\n\nFunding: Not specified.",
