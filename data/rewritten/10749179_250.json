A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Intrathecal Morphine Doses in Total Knee Arthroplasty\n\nBackground: Intrathecal morphine (ITM) is used for postoperative analgesia in total knee arthroplasty (TKA) under spinal anesthesia. This study compares two ITM doses to determine optimal analgesic efficacy and side effect profile.\n\nMethods: This retrospective, single-center study at the University of Alabama at Birmingham included 75 patients undergoing primary TKA. Participants were randomized into three groups: a control group receiving continuous adductor canal block (CCACB) and two experimental groups receiving single-dose adductor canal block (SSACB) with either 100 mcg or 150 mcg of ITM. The primary outcome was oral morphine equivalents (OME) consumption within 24 hours post-surgery. Randomization was conducted using a random numbers generator, and outcome assessors were blinded.\n\nResults: Both ITM groups showed significantly lower OME consumption and pain scores in the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) compared to the control group (p<0.001). Cumulative OME at 24 hours was significantly lower in ITM groups (p=0.004). No significant differences in antiemetic use or ambulation distance were observed. No adverse events, including respiratory depression, were reported.\n\nInterpretation: ITM doses of 100 mcg and 150 mcg provide effective analgesia with a similar safety profile in TKA. Further research is needed to explore higher ITM doses and broader patient populations.\n\nTrial registration: Not provided.\n\nFunding: Not specified.",
