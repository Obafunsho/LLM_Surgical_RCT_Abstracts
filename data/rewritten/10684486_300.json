This study evaluates the efficacy and safety of closed versus open lateral internal sphincterotomy (LIS).\n\nMethods: This meta-analysis included eight randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with 1035 participants, predominantly female (54.9%) and with posterior midline fissures (86.1%). Participants were adults with chronic anal fissure. The primary outcome was the postoperative healing rate, assessed over a follow-up period. Randomisation methods varied, with inconsistent reporting on allocation concealment and blinding.\n\nResults: The overall postoperative healing rate was 90.2% (closed LIS: 90.1%, open LIS: 90.3%). Recurrent anal fissure occurred in 3.7% of cases (closed LIS: 2.3%, open LIS: 1.4%). Postoperative incontinence was observed in 8.9% of patients (closed LIS: 6.6%, open LIS: 11.0%). Closed LIS showed higher recurrence rates (RR = 1.73, 95% CI 0.86–3.47) and lower incontinence rates (RR = 0.60, 95% CI 0.37–0.96) compared to open LIS. Adverse events, including postoperative pain and infection, were more frequent in the open LIS group.\n\nInterpretation: Closed LIS is a safe and effective surgical option for chronic anal fissure, offering lower incontinence rates and comparable healing rates to open LIS. The study highlights the need for standardised randomisation and blinding methods in future trials. Trial registration: PROSPERO CRD42023392626. Funding: Not specified.",
