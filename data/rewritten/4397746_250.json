A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Autologous Bone Marrow Aspirate Concentrate and Platelet-Rich Plasma in Tibial Lengthening\n\nBackground: Poor bone regeneration during lower limb lengthening is a significant complication. This study evaluates the efficacy of autologous bone marrow aspirate concentrate (BMAC) combined with platelet-rich plasma (PRP) in enhancing osteogenesis.\n\nMethods: This randomised controlled trial involved 22 patients (44 tibias) undergoing bilateral tibial lengthening for familial short stature using the lengthening over nail technique. Two patients were excluded, leaving 20 patients (40 segments) for analysis. Participants were randomised to receive either BMAC plus PRP injection at the osteotomy site (treatment group, n=10) or no injection (control group, n=10). Randomisation was performed using a computer-generated sequence, and allocation was concealed. The primary outcome was the cortical healing index, assessed over a minimum follow-up of 24 months. The surgeon assessing radiographic healing was blinded to group allocation.\n\nResults: The treatment group showed significantly faster cortical healing indexes (anterior/posterior/medial/lateral: 1.14/0.81/0.96/0.88 months/cm) compared to the control group (1.47/1.26/1.42/1.22 months/cm; all p<0.001). Full weightbearing was achieved earlier in the treatment group (0.99 months/cm) than in the control group (1.38 months/cm, p<0.001). No differences in callus shape and type were observed. No adverse events were reported.\n\nInterpretation: BMAC combined with PRP injection at the osteotomy site enhances bone healing in tibial lengthening, although the effect size is small.
