A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Preoperative Smoking Cessation Interventions\n\nBackground: Smoking is a leading cause of preventable death and increases postoperative complications. This study evaluates the effectiveness of preoperative smoking cessation interventions.\n\nMethods: This systematic review included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and non-RCTs. Participants were smokers aged over 18 scheduled for elective surgery. The intervention group received preoperative smoking cessation support, while the control group received usual care. The primary outcome was smoking cessation at surgery time and at the last follow-up. Randomisation and allocation concealment methods were not specified. Blinding details were not provided.\n\nResults: Sixteen studies (3505 participants) were included, with 14 RCTs (2940 participants) in the meta-analysis. The intervention group had significantly increased odds of quitting smoking at surgery time (RR 1.64, 95% CI 1.30–2.07) and at the longest follow-up (RR 1.38, 95% CI 1.12–1.70). No significant difference in postoperative complications was observed (RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.62–1.06). Adverse events were not reported.\n\nInterpretation: Preoperative smoking cessation interventions significantly increase quit rates at surgery time and at follow-up, with no difference in postoperative complications. Standardised outcome measurements are recommended for future studies.\n\nTrial registration: PROSPERO CRD42023423202.\n\nFunding: Not specified.",
