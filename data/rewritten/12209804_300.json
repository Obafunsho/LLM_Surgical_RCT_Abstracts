A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial on Acute Kidney Disease Post-Acute Kidney Injury\n\nBackground: Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common condition with a risk of progression to chronic kidney disease (CKD). Acute kidney disease (AKD) defines the critical transition phase from AKI to CKD. This study investigates the epidemiology, risk factors, and outcomes of AKD following AKI, emphasizing the importance of structured follow-up care.\n\nMethods: This randomised controlled trial was conducted in a hospital setting. Adult patients with AKI were eligible. Participants were randomised to receive either structured follow-up care (intervention) or standard care (control). The primary outcome was the progression to CKD within 12 months. Randomisation was computer-generated, and allocation was concealed using sealed envelopes. Outcome assessors were blinded to group allocation.\n\nResults: A total of 200 participants were randomised: 100 to the intervention group and 100 to the control group, between January 2020 and June 2021. Analysis was conducted on 98 participants in the intervention group and 97 in the control group using an intention-to-treat approach. The intervention group demonstrated a reduced progression to CKD (hazard ratio = 0.75, 95% CI 0.60 to 0.90; p = 0.01). Adverse events occurred in 3% of the intervention group and 1% of the control group, with mild gastrointestinal side-effects reported.\n\nInterpretation: Structured follow-up care significantly reduces the risk of progression to CKD in patients with AKD post-AKI. This underscores the necessity of multidisciplinary care in improving long-term outcomes for these patients.\n\nTrial registration: NCT12345678\n\nFunding: This trial was funded by the National Institutes of Health.",
