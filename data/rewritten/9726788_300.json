This study investigates the effectiveness of combining fluorescence-guided surgery (FGS) with photoimmunotherapy (PIT) using a fluorescent tumor-specific antibody.\n\nMethods: This randomised controlled trial involved 16 nude mice with surgical orthotopic implantation of the human pancreatic cancer cell line BxPC-3. An anti-CEACAM monoclonal antibody (6G5j) conjugated to the 700-nm dye IR700DyeDX was administered intravenously. Mice were randomised into FGS-only (n=8) and FGS + PIT (n=8) groups using a computer-generated sequence, with allocation concealment. The primary outcome was the rate of metastatic recurrence, assessed four weeks post-surgery. Blinding was not applied to outcome assessors, patients, or clinicians.\n\nResults: The 6G5j-IR700DX dye effectively illuminated orthotopic pancreatic tumors for FGS and PIT. The metastatic recurrence rate was 100% in the FGS-only group and 25% in the FGS + PIT group (p=0.007). The average total recurrent tumor weight was 2370.3 ± 1907.8 mg for FGS-only and 705.5 ± 1200.0 mg for FGS + PIT (p=0.039). No adverse events were reported in either group.\n\nInterpretation: The combination of FGS and PIT significantly reduces the frequency of pancreatic cancer recurrence, suggesting potential clinical benefits in improving surgical outcomes by enhancing tumor margin visualization and reducing recurrence rates.\n\nTrial registration: Not provided.\n\nFunding: Not specified.",
