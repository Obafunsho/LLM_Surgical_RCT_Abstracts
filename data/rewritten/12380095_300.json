A 300-word version\n\nTitle: A Randomised Controlled Trial Comparing Spinal Analgesia–Epidural Analgesia and Combined Spinal–Epidural Analgesia in Reducing Neurological Complications During Labor Analgesia\n\nBackground: Neurological complications during labor analgesia pose significant clinical challenges. This trial aims to compare spinal analgesia–epidural analgesia (SA-EA) and combined spinal–epidural analgesia (CSEA) in mitigating these complications.\n\nMethods: Conducted at [Study Setting], this randomised controlled trial included participants meeting [Eligibility Criteria]. Participants were randomly assigned to SA-EA or CSEA groups using [Randomisation Method] with allocation concealment via [Concealment Method]. Blinding was applied to [Blinded Parties]. The primary outcome was the incidence of neurological complications within [Timeframe]. A total of [Sample Size] participants were recruited between [Recruitment Period].\n\nIntervention: In the SA-EA group, a standard spinal needle was used for dural puncture, followed by intrathecal injection of 2mL of 0.1% ropivacaine + 1µg/mL sufentanil. An epidural catheter was inserted approximately 4cm into the epidural space. In the CSEA group, an epidural needle was used for puncture, followed by a spinal needle for dural puncture and the same intrathecal injection. An epidural catheter was inserted thereafter.\n\nResults: [Number Analysed] participants were analysed using [Analysis Approach]. The incidence of neurological complications was [Effect Size, CI, p-value]. Adverse events were reported in [Frequency and Severity by Group].\n\nInterpretation: This study highlights the comparative safety and efficacy of SA-EA and CSEA techniques, providing valuable insights for clinical practice. The introduction of the concept of neuraxial homeostasis is significant for the field of anesthesia. Trial registration: [Registration Number]. Funding: [Source of Funding].",
