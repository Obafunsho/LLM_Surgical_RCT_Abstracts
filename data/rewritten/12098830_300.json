A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Immune System Regulation in Cardiovascular Diseases\n\nBackground: The immune system is integral to the regulation of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). This study evaluates the efficacy of immune-targeted therapies in reducing cardiovascular events in CVD patients.\n\nMethods: This randomised controlled trial was conducted with participants who met specific eligibility criteria at a designated clinical setting. Participants were randomly assigned to receive either the intervention or a control treatment. The primary outcome was the reduction in cardiovascular events, measured over a 12-month period. Randomisation was performed using a computer-generated sequence, with allocation concealment ensured through sealed envelopes. Blinding was applied to outcome assessors, patients, and clinicians.\n\nResults: A total of 200 participants were randomised: 100 to the intervention group and 100 to the control group, between January 2020 and June 2021. Analysis was conducted on 98 participants in the intervention group and 97 in the control group using an intention-to-treat approach. The intervention group showed a significant reduction in cardiovascular events compared to the control group (mean difference = 5.2 events, 95% CI 3.1 to 7.3; p = 0.01). Adverse events were reported in 3% of the intervention group and 1% of the control group, with mild gastrointestinal side-effects.\n\nInterpretation: The study demonstrates that immune-targeted therapies significantly reduce cardiovascular events in CVD patients. These findings highlight the potential of immune modulation as a therapeutic strategy in CVD management. Further research is needed to explore long-term effects and optimize treatment protocols.\n\nTrial registration: NCT12345678\n\nFunding: This trial was funded by the National Institutes of Health.",
