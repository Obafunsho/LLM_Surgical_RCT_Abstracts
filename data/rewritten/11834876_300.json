The study was conducted at a tertiary hospital from July 2021 to May 2023. The primary outcome was the change in N20 latency of somatosensory-evoked potentials (SEP) measured preoperatively and 30 minutes after anesthetic induction (T1). Randomisation was computer-generated with allocation concealment using opaque envelopes. Patients, surgeons, and outcome assessors were blinded.\n\nResults: 33 patients were randomised to each group, and all were analysed using an intention-to-treat approach. The change in N20 latency at T1 compared to preoperative values was not significantly different between Group R and Group P (mean difference = 0.2 ms, 95% CI -0.3 to 0.7; p = 0.45). Except for the amplitude of the right abductor brevis, there was no significant group-by-time interaction effect for intraoperative MEP amplitudes or SEP latencies and amplitudes. Adverse events were similar between groups, with one case of myodesopsia and one urinary tract infection in Group P, and two wound problems in Group R, all resolved before discharge. Trial registration: NCT04968054.\n\nFunding: The study was funded by the Yonsei University Health System.",
