A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Cost-Effectiveness of UDCA Prophylaxis in Preventing Symptomatic Gallstone Disease: A Randomised Controlled Trial\n\nBackground: This study aimed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness and cost-utility of ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) prophylaxis for preventing symptomatic gallstone disease after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) in patients without preoperative gallstones.\n\nMethods: Conducted as a multicentre, double-blind, randomised placebo-controlled superiority trial, patients scheduled for laparoscopic RYGB or sleeve gastrectomy were randomised to receive 900 mg UDCA or placebo for 6 months. The primary outcome was the incidence of symptomatic gallstone disease within 24 months. Randomisation was performed using a computer-generated sequence with allocation concealment. Patients, clinicians, and outcome assessors were blinded. A total of 985 patients were enrolled between January 2017 and October 2018, with 705 analysed in the modified intention-to-treat analysis.\n\nResults: UDCA prophylaxis significantly reduced the risk of symptomatic gallstone disease (relative risk 1.06, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.11; P = 0.002) and increased QALYs by 0.047 (95% CI 0.007 to 0.088; P = 0.022). Cost differences were –€356 (95% CI –1573 to 761) from a healthcare perspective and –€1392 (95% CI –3807 to 917) from a societal perspective, favouring UDCA. No significant adverse events were reported, with mild gastrointestinal side-effects occurring in 3% of the UDCA group and 1% of the placebo group.\n\nInterpretation: UDCA prophylaxis after RYGB in patients without preoperative gallstones is cost-effective, with a probability of being cost-effective of at least 0.872. The findings support the implementation of UDCA prophylaxis in this patient population. Trial registration: NCTXXXXX. Funding: Supported by [Funding Source].",
