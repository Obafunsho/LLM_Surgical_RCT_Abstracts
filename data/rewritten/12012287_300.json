A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Pulsatile vs Nonpulsatile Cardiopulmonary Bypass in Pediatric Congenital Heart Surgery\n\nBackground: This study aimed to assess the effects of pulsatile versus nonpulsatile cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) on cerebral hemodynamics and clinical outcomes in pediatric patients with congenital heart disease (CHD), stratified by acyanotic and cyanotic conditions.\n\nMethods: In this randomised controlled trial, 159 pediatric patients (<18 years) scheduled for cardiac surgery at Penn State Health Children's Hospital were randomised to pulsatile (n=83) or nonpulsatile (n=76) CPB. Participants were stratified by CHD type. The primary outcome was organ injury, measured by the Pediatric Logistic Organ Dysfunction-2 (PELOD-2) score at 24, 48, and 72 hours postoperatively. Randomisation was computer-generated, and allocation was concealed. Blinding was not applied to outcome assessors, patients, or clinicians.\n\nResults: The pulsatility index was significantly higher in the pulsatile group (p<0.05), but no significant differences were observed in regional cerebral oxygen saturation, mean arterial pressure, or gaseous microemboli counts. PELOD-2 scores decreased similarly across groups. Secondary outcomes, including Pediatric Risk of Mortality-3 score, vasoactive–inotropic score, mechanical ventilation duration, ICU and hospital stay, and 180-day mortality, showed no significant differences between groups. Pulsatile perfusion was associated with higher vasoactive–inotropic scores at 48 hours. Adverse events were not reported.\n\nInterpretation: While pulsatile CPB achieved higher pulsatility indices, it did not lead to improved cerebral hemodynamics or clinical outcomes compared to nonpulsatile CPB in acyanotic or cyanotic CHD patients. The findings suggest that pulsatile perfusion may not confer additional benefits in this population, warranting further investigation into its effects on vascular tone and myocardial recovery.\n\nTrial registration: NCT00862407\n\nFunding: Not specified.",
