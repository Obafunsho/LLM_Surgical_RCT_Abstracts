A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Intravenous Nalbuphine for Attenuation of Pruritus in Postoperative Epidural Morphine Analgesia\n\nBackground: Epidural morphine effectively controls postoperative pain but often induces pruritus. This study evaluates the efficacy and safety of intravenous nalbuphine in reducing pruritus and related side effects in patients receiving epidural morphine for postoperative analgesia.\n\nMethods: Ninety pregnant ASA II females scheduled for elective cesarean delivery were randomly assigned to receive either nalbuphine (5 μg/kg/hour, Group N5; 10 μg/kg/hour, Group N10) or normal saline (control group) in a patient-controlled antipruritus (PCP) regimen. The primary outcome was the incidence of pruritus, measured at multiple postoperative intervals. Randomisation was computer-generated, and allocation was concealed. Blinding was applied to patients, clinicians, and outcome assessors.\n\nResults: Ninety participants were randomised: 30 to Group N5, 30 to Group N10, and 30 to the control group. Analysis was conducted on all participants using an intention-to-treat approach. Group N10 showed reduced pruritus incidence compared to the control (p < 0.05). Group N5 maintained analgesia with lower pruritus incidence. Adverse events were fewer in nalbuphine groups, with mild severity.\n\nInterpretation: Intravenous nalbuphine at 5 μg/kg/hour effectively reduces pruritus without compromising analgesia in patients receiving epidural morphine. The study supports nalbuphine's use for improved postoperative care.\n\nTrial registration: [Trial registration number]\n\nFunding: [Source of funding]",
