A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Dexmedetomidine and Propofol in Hysteroscopic Surgery\n\nBackground: This study aimed to determine the optimal dose of dexmedetomidine combined with propofol for hysteroscopic surgery, focusing on propofol-sparing effects and sedation quality.\n\nMethods: In this randomised controlled trial, 150 patients aged 18-60 years with ASA status I-II undergoing hysteroscopic surgery at the Affiliated Hospital of North Sichuan Medical College were randomly assigned to receive dexmedetomidine at 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, or 1.0 µg/kg, or saline. Propofol was administered via target-controlled infusion. The primary outcome was the EC50 of propofol, measured intraoperatively. Randomisation was performed using SPSS software, and allocation was concealed. Both patients and clinicians were blinded. Recruitment occurred from June to November 2020.\n\nResults: The EC50 of propofol was significantly lower in the Dex 0.6, Dex 0.8, and Dex 1.0 groups compared to the saline group (p < 0.05). Higher dexmedetomidine doses reduced propofol requirements and respiratory depression incidence (p < 0.01) but increased bradycardia incidence (p = 0.02). No significant differences in hypotension were observed. Postoperative comfort scores were higher in the Dex1.0 group.\n\nInterpretation: Dexmedetomidine at 0.8 µg/kg offers an optimal balance between propofol-sparing effects and sedation quality with manageable side effects.
