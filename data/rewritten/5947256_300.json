A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial Comparing Intracutaneous and Transcutaneous Suturing of Ileostomies\n\nBackground: Ileostomy construction is a common procedure associated with significant morbidity. This study aimed to compare the effects of intracutaneous versus transcutaneous suturing of ileostomies on faecal leakage and quality of life.\n\nMethods: This multicentre, parallel-group randomised controlled trial was conducted in 11 hospitals in the Netherlands. Eligible participants were aged 18-80 years, scheduled for ileostomy, and provided informed consent. Patients were randomised 1:1 to receive either intracutaneous (IC) or transcutaneous (TC) suturing. The primary outcome was faecal leakage within 3 months post-surgery. Secondary outcomes included stoma-related quality of life and costs. Randomisation was computerised, with allocation concealed in sealed envelopes. Blinding was not applied to outcome assessors, patients, or clinicians.\n\nResults: Between April 2011 and February 2016, 339 patients were randomised: 170 to the IC group and 169 to the TC group. Leakage rates were higher in the IC group (52.4%) compared to the TC group (41.4%), with a risk difference of 11.0% (95% CI 0.3 to 21.2). Skin irritation rates were high in both groups (78.2% IC vs 72.2% TC), with no significant difference (risk difference 6.1%, 95% CI -3.2 to 15.1). No significant differences were found in quality of life or costs between the groups. Analysis was conducted on an intention-to-treat basis.\n\nInterpretation: Intracutaneous suturing of ileostomies is associated with increased peristomal leakage compared to transcutaneous suturing. Overall stoma-related complications did not differ significantly between the two techniques. Trial registration: NTR2369.\n\nFunding: Not specified.",
