A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Tacrolimus QD vs. BD in Kidney Transplantation\n\nBackground: This study assessed the efficacy of once-daily (QD) tacrolimus compared to twice-daily (BD) tacrolimus in kidney transplant recipients.\n\nMethods: In this open-label, parallel-group trial, 1198 adults with end-stage renal disease undergoing kidney transplantation were randomised to receive tacrolimus BD 0.2 mg/kg/day (Arm 1), QD 0.2 mg/kg/day (Arm 2), QD 0.3 mg/kg/day (Arm 3), or QD 0.2 mg/kg/day with basiliximab (Arm 4). All regimens included mycophenolate mofetil and corticosteroids. The primary outcome was efficacy failure (graft loss, biopsy-confirmed acute rejection, or graft dysfunction) at 24 weeks. Randomisation was centrally coordinated, and the study was conducted at 110 centers in 22 countries.\n\nResults: 976 patients were analysed per protocol: 237 in Arm 1, 263 in Arm 2, 246 in Arm 3, and 230 in Arm 4. Noninferiority was demonstrated for Arm 2 versus Arm 1 (difference, −1.6%; 95% CI, −12.2% to 9.0%). Noninferiority was not confirmed for Arm 3 (difference, −3.5%; 95% CI, −13.6% to 6.6%) or Arm 4 (difference, −7.1%; 95% CI, −16.1% to 1.9%). Graft dysfunction was the main determinant of efficacy failure. Adverse events were similar across groups, with treatment-emergent adverse events ranging from 94% to 96%. The incidence of new-onset diabetes mellitus was comparable between groups.\n\nInterpretation: Tacrolimus QD 0.2 mg/kg/day without induction is noninferior to BD in efficacy for kidney transplantation. The study supports the use of QD tacrolimus as a viable alternative to BD regimens. Trial registration: NCT00717470. Funding: Astellas Pharma Europe Ltd.",
