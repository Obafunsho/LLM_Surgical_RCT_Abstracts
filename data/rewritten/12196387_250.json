A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial on the Cardioprotective Effects of Ginsenosides Against Anthracycline-Induced Cardiotoxicity\n\nBackground: Anthracyclines are essential in cancer treatment but are limited by cardiotoxicity. Current treatments for anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity (AIC) have drawbacks, necessitating novel therapies. Ginsenosides, bioactive constituents of Panax plants, show potential cardioprotective effects.\n\nMethods: This randomised controlled trial was conducted to evaluate the efficacy of ginsenosides in preventing AIC. Participants were eligible if they were undergoing anthracycline treatment and met specific inclusion criteria. The study was conducted in a clinical setting. Participants were randomised to receive either ginsenosides or a placebo. Randomisation was computer-generated, and allocation was concealed using sealed envelopes. Blinding was applied to patients, clinicians, and outcome assessors.\n\nResults: A total of 200 participants were randomised, with 100 in the ginsenoside group and 100 in the placebo group. The primary outcome was the change in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) over six months. Analysis was conducted on 98 participants in the ginsenoside group and 97 in the placebo group using an intention-to-treat approach. The ginsenoside group showed a significant improvement in LVEF compared to placebo (mean difference = 5.2%, 95% CI 3.1 to 7.3; p = 0.01). Adverse events were mild, with 3% in the ginsenoside group and 1% in the placebo group experiencing gastrointestinal side effects.\n\nInterpretation: Ginsenosides significantly improve cardiac function in patients undergoing anthracycline treatment, offering a promising strategy for AIC prevention.\n\nTrial registration: [Trial registration number]\n\nFunding: The trial was funded by [source of funding].",
