A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Goal-Directed Fluid Management in Neurosurgery: A Randomised Controlled Trial\n\nBackground: This randomised controlled trial assessed the impact of goal-directed fluid management on postoperative brain edema in patients undergoing resection of supratentorial malignant gliomas.\n\nMethods: We enrolled 480 adults aged 18–65 years, scheduled for elective glioma resection at a single hospital, and randomly assigned them to goal-directed (n=240) or routine fluid management (n=240) using block randomisation with concealed allocation. The intervention group received 3 ml/kg hydroxyethyl starch when stroke volume variation exceeded 15% for 5 minutes. The primary outcome was cerebral edema volume within 24 hours post-surgery, assessed by CT. Patients, outcome assessors, and follow-up assessors were blinded.\n\nResults: Between November 2018 and September 2022, 480 patients were randomised. Analysis included 239 in the goal-directed group and 240 in the routine group, using an intention-to-treat approach. The goal-directed group received significantly less crystalloid (5.4 vs. 7.0 ml/kg/hour, P<0.001) and colloid (1.1 vs. 1.7 ml/kg/hour, P<0.001). No significant difference in brain edema volume was observed (36.0 vs. 38.9 cm³, mean difference: 0.18 cm³, 95% CI: −5.7 to 5.9, P=0.938). Intraoperative dural tension was lower in the goal-directed group (risk ratio: 0.63, 95% CI: 0.50–0.80, P<0.001). No significant differences were found in Karnofsky Performance Status at 30 days or in adverse events between groups.\n\nInterpretation: Goal-directed fluid management reduced intraoperative fluid volumes and dural tension but did not decrease postoperative brain edema. The trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov (NCT03323580) and funded by the Beijing Municipal Administration of Hospitals Incubating Program.",
