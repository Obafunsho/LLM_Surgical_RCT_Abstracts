A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial on the Cardioprotective Effects of Ginsenosides Against Anthracycline-Induced Cardiotoxicity\n\nBackground: Anthracyclines are pivotal in cancer therapy but are associated with cardiotoxicity, limiting their clinical use. Current treatments for anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity (AIC) have limitations, highlighting the need for novel therapeutic options. Ginsenosides, active compounds from Panax plants, have shown potential cardioprotective properties.\n\nMethods: This randomised controlled trial aimed to assess the efficacy of ginsenosides in preventing AIC. Participants undergoing anthracycline treatment were recruited based on specific eligibility criteria. The study was conducted in a clinical setting. Participants were randomised to receive either ginsenosides or a placebo. Randomisation was performed using a computer-generated sequence, and allocation was concealed with sealed envelopes. Blinding was maintained for patients, clinicians, and outcome assessors.\n\nResults: A total of 200 participants were randomised, with 100 assigned to the ginsenoside group and 100 to the placebo group, during the recruitment period from January 2020 to June 2021. The primary outcome was the change in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) over a six-month period. Analysis included 98 participants in the ginsenoside group and 97 in the placebo group, following an intention-to-treat approach. The ginsenoside group demonstrated a significant improvement in LVEF compared to the placebo group (mean difference = 5.2%, 95% CI 3.1 to 7.3; p = 0.01). Adverse events were mild, with 3% in the ginsenoside group and 1% in the placebo group experiencing gastrointestinal side effects.\n\nInterpretation: Ginsenosides significantly enhance cardiac function in patients receiving anthracycline therapy, providing a promising approach for AIC prevention.\n\nTrial registration: [Trial registration number]\n\nFunding: The trial was funded by [source of funding].",
