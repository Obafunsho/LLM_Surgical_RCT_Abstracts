This study aimed to assess the impact of preoperative midazolam on postoperative sleep in children undergoing ambulatory tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy.\n\nMethods: Conducted at Yale-New Haven Children’s Hospital, this two-group randomised controlled trial included 70 children aged 3 to 12 years. Participants were randomly assigned to receive either preoperative acetaminophen only (control group, n = 32) or both acetaminophen and midazolam (experimental group, n = 38). Randomisation was achieved through a computer-generated sequence, with allocation concealment ensured. Parents completed postoperative behavioral recovery assessments, and a subset of children wore actigraphs for objective sleep measurement. Outcome assessors were blinded to group assignments.\n\nResults: The primary outcome was postoperative sleep, evaluated using actigraphy over a specified timeframe. Children in the midazolam group experienced significantly fewer nighttime awakenings compared to the control group (p = 0.01). Analysis was conducted on all randomised participants using an intention-to-treat approach. No significant adverse events were reported in either group, indicating the safety of midazolam in this context.\n\nInterpretation: The administration of preoperative midazolam was associated with improved postoperative sleep, as indicated by reduced nighttime awakenings. These results suggest that midazolam may enhance postoperative recovery in pediatric patients. Further studies are warranted to investigate the broader behavioral effects of midazolam and its potential benefits in pediatric surgical settings.\n\nTrial registration: [Trial registration number]\n\nFunding: [Source of funding]",
