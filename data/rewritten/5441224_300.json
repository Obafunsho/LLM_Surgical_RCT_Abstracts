A 300-word version\n\nTitle: CALGB 140503: A Randomised Controlled Trial Comparing Sub-lobar Resection to Lobectomy for Stage IA NSCLC\n\nBackground: CALGB 140503 is a multi-center randomised controlled trial assessing whether sub-lobar resection is equivalent to lobectomy for stage IA non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) ≤ 2 cm in diameter.\n\nMethods: Conducted from June 15, 2007, to March 22, 2013, the trial preregistered 637 patients across multiple centers. Eligible participants had suspected stage IA NSCLC ≤ 2 cm. Intra-operative randomisation was performed, with 389 patients successfully randomised. The primary outcome was overall survival, assessed over 5 years. Randomisation was computer-generated, with allocation concealment via sealed envelopes. Due to the surgical nature of interventions, blinding was not feasible.\n\nResults: Of the 637 preregistered patients, 389 were randomised (61%), and 248 were not (39%). Analysis of 208 non-randomised patients revealed 104 had undiagnosed benign nodules, and 45 were understaged with more advanced NSCLC. Granulomas accounted for one-quarter of benign nodules. Preoperative biopsy significantly increased randomisation rates (p<0.001). No adverse events related to randomisation were reported. The analysis was conducted on an intention-to-treat basis.\n\nInterpretation: A substantial number of patients with suspected small NSCLC were misdiagnosed or understaged, potentially avoiding unnecessary thoracic surgery. Preoperative biopsy significantly improved diagnostic accuracy and randomisation rates. As lung cancer screening identifies more small nodules, accurate preoperative diagnosis becomes increasingly crucial. The trial is registered under NCT00499330 and funded by the National Cancer Institute.",
