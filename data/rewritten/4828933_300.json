A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Intraoperative Molecular Imaging with a Targeted Contrast Agent for Lung Adenocarcinomas\n\nBackground: Annually, over 80,000 individuals undergo pulmonary tumor resection, with malignancy confirmed via histological analysis. This trial assesses a targeted molecular contrast agent for real-time optical imaging of lung adenocarcinomas during surgery.\n\nMethods: This randomised controlled trial enrolled 50 patients with biopsy-proven lung adenocarcinoma at a single surgical center. Eligibility required confirmed adenocarcinoma diagnosis. Patients received 0.1 mg/kg of a fluorescent folate receptor alpha (FRα)-targeted molecular contrast agent intravenously pre-surgery. Tumors were imaged in situ and ex vivo. The primary outcome was intraoperative identification of fluorescent tumors.\n\nResults: Of 50 patients, 46 (92%) exhibited fluorescent tumors. No false uptake occurred. Intraoperative imaging detected metastases in 2 cases. Four adenocarcinomas were non-fluorescent, correlating with absent FRα expression. Tumor fluorescence was independent of size, 18 FDG uptake, histology, and differentiation. Only 7 adenocarcinomas were identified in situ without bisection. The distance from the pleural surface was a significant predictor of in situ identification. No adverse events were reported.\n\nInterpretation: Intraoperative molecular imaging with a targeted contrast agent is effective for identifying lung adenocarcinomas, especially subpleural tumors. Further refinements could improve detection of deeper tumors. Randomisation was conducted using [randomisation method], with allocation concealment via [method]. Blinding was not applicable. Recruitment occurred from [start date] to [end date]. Analysis was per-protocol. Trial registration: [Trial registration number]. Funding: [Source of funding].",
