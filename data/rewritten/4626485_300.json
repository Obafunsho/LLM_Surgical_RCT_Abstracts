A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial Comparing Oxidized Zirconium and Stainless Steel Femoral Heads in Total Hip Arthroplasty\n\nBackground: This randomised controlled trial evaluated the wear rates of oxidized zirconium versus stainless steel femoral heads in total hip arthroplasty (THA) using highly crosslinked polyethylene (HXLPE) and ultrahigh-molecular-weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) sockets.\n\nMethods: One hundred patients eligible for cemented THA were randomised to receive either oxidized zirconium or stainless steel femoral heads. UHMWPE was used in the first 50 patients, and HXLPE in the next 50. Randomisation was computer-generated, and allocation was concealed using sealed envelopes. The primary outcome was femoral head penetration, measured over a minimum follow-up of 4 years. Blinding was applied to outcome assessors. Complete follow-up data were available for 86 patients. The analysis was conducted on a per-protocol basis.\n\nResults: In the UHMWPE group, the median steady-state penetration rate was 0.03 mm/year (range, 0.003–0.25 mm/year) for oxidized zirconium versus 0.11 mm/year (range, 0.03–0.29 mm/year) for stainless steel (difference of medians 0.08, p < 0.001). In the HXLPE group, the rates were 0.02 mm/year (range, −0.32 to 0.07 mm/year) for oxidized zirconium versus 0.05 mm/year (range, −0.39 to 0.11 mm/year) for stainless steel (difference of medians 0.03, p < 0.001). Merle d’Aubigné scores showed no significant difference between groups, with a median of 18 in each group. No adverse events were reported.\n\nInterpretation: Oxidized zirconium femoral heads demonstrated reduced wear compared to stainless steel in both UHMWPE and HXLPE sockets. The clinical significance of these findings requires further investigation with longer follow-up. Trial registration: [Trial registration number]. Funding: [Source of funding].",
