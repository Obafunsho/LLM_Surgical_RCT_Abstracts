A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Total Neoadjuvant Therapy with Chemoimmunotherapy in High-Risk pMMR Rectal Cancer\n\nBackground: The efficacy of total neoadjuvant therapy (TNT) combined with immunotherapy for proficient mismatch repair (pMMR) rectal cancer is unclear.\n\nMethods: This single-arm phase 2 trial was conducted at the Gastrointestinal Cancer Center, Peking University Cancer Hospital & Institute, from June 2020 to October 2021. Participants were patients with high-risk pMMR rectal cancer. The intervention included 3 cycles of induction oxaliplatin and capecitabine combined with camrelizumab, followed by radiotherapy (50.6 Gy in 22 fractions) with concurrent capecitabine. Patients without disease progression received 2 cycles of consolidation oxaliplatin/capecitabine. The primary outcome was the pathologic complete response rate, measured at the end of treatment. Randomisation and blinding details were not applicable as this was a single-arm study.\n\nResults: Of 25 patients enrolled (19 men, 6 women; median age 58 years), 22 completed the TNT schedule. The pathologic complete response rate was 33.3% (7/21). Twelve patients achieved clinical complete response, and 4 chose to watch and wait. R0 resection was achieved in all 21 patients, with a major pathologic response rate of 38.1% (8/21). The most common adverse event was nausea (80%); grade 3 toxic effects occurred in 36% of patients. LRP1B mutation was associated with higher tumor mutation burden and response to therapy.\n\nInterpretation: TNT with induction chemoimmunotherapy followed by long-course chemoradiation is safe and effective for high-risk pMMR rectal cancer. Further studies are needed to validate these findings. Trial registration and funding details were not provided.",
