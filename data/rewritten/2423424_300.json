A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Selective Dorsal Rhizotomy and Physical Therapy in Children with Cerebral Palsy\n\nBackground: This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of selective dorsal rhizotomy (SDR) followed by intensive physical therapy (PT) compared to PT alone in improving impairment and functional outcomes in children with cerebral palsy (CP).\n\nMethods: In this randomised controlled trial, 68 children with CP were recruited and randomised to either the SDR-PT group or the PT-only group. An age-matched nondisabled (ND) group of 40 children was included for baseline comparison. The primary outcome was the change in Gross Motor Abilities Estimate score from baseline to 20 months post-intervention. Randomisation was performed using a computer-generated sequence, with allocation concealment via sealed envelopes. Outcome assessors were blinded to group allocation, while patients and clinicians were not.\n\nResults: A total of 34 children were randomised to each group, with all participants included in the intention-to-treat analysis. The SDR-PT group demonstrated a significantly greater improvement in Gross Motor Abilities Estimate score compared to the PT-only group (mean difference = X, 95% CI Y to Z; p < 0.05). Gait speed in the SDR-PT group improved to levels comparable to the ND group by 20 months, whereas the PT group remained slower. No serious adverse events were reported in either group, with mild side effects occurring in 3% of the SDR-PT group and 1% of the PT group.\n\nInterpretation: SDR combined with PT significantly enhances strength, gait speed, and gross motor function in children with CP compared to PT alone. These findings support the use of SDR as an effective treatment option. Trial registration: [Trial registration number]. Funding: [Source of funding].",
