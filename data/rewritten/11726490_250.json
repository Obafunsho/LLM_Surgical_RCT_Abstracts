A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial on the Impact of Tourniquet and Adductor Canal Block on Quadriceps Strength Post-TKA\n\nBackground: Quadriceps weakness post-total knee arthroplasty (TKA) can delay rehabilitation and increase fall risk. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of tourniquet and/or adductor canal block (ACB) on postoperative quadriceps strength.\n\nMethods: In this randomised controlled trial, primary elective TKA patients were randomly assigned to one of four groups: tourniquet/ACB, tourniquet/no ACB, ACB/no tourniquet, and no tourniquet/no ACB. The study was conducted at [Study Setting]. Eligibility criteria included [Eligibility Criteria]. Bilateral isometric knee extension strength was measured preoperatively and within 36 hours postoperatively. The primary outcome was the change in quadriceps strength, standardized to the contralateral leg. Randomisation was achieved using [Randomisation Method] with allocation concealment via [Concealment Method]. Blinding was applied to [Blinded Parties].\n\nResults: A total of 203 patients were randomised: 68 to tourniquet/ACB, 45 to tourniquet/no ACB, 45 to ACB/no tourniquet, and 45 to no tourniquet/no ACB. Analysis was conducted using [Analysis Approach]. Tourniquet use was associated with shorter operative time (p=0.004), while ACB use was linked to longer lengths of stay (p=0.005). No significant differences were found in strength measures, pain, or knee buckling across groups. No inpatient falls occurred.\n\nInterpretation: Combined tourniquet and ACB use during TKA does not exacerbate postoperative quadriceps weakness or increase buckling events. These findings suggest that concerns about early postoperative functionality should not deter the use of tourniquet or ACB. Trial registration: [Registration Number]. Funding: [Funding Source].",
