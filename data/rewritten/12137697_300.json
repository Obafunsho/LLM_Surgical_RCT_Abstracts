A 300-word version\n\nTitle: A Randomised Controlled Trial of Cytoreductive Surgery and Hyperthermic Intrathoracic Chemotherapy for Thymic Epithelial Tumors with Pleural Spread or Recurrence\n\nBackground: Thymic epithelial tumors (TETs) with pleural spread or recurrence are difficult to treat, with no recognized effective therapy. This study assesses the safety and efficacy of cytoreductive surgery followed by hyperthermic intrathoracic chemotherapy (S-HITOC) in this setting.\n\nMethods: Conducted as an open, single-arm, phase II trial at Zhongshan Hospital of Fudan University, 45 adult patients with TETs and pleural dissemination were enrolled from August 1, 2021, to February 29, 2024. The intervention involved S-HITOC with 25 mg/m² doxorubicin and 50 mg/m² cisplatin. The primary outcome was the incidence of treatment-related adverse events of grade ≥3, assessed perioperatively. No randomisation or blinding was applied.\n\nResults: Of the 45 patients, eight (17.8%) experienced grade ≥3 adverse events. The pain Visual Analog Scale (VAS) score was 5.4 ± 1.9 on day 1 post-treatment, returning to baseline by day 7 (p = 0.218). Quality of life scores showed no significant difference from baseline to day 60 (p = 0.676). The estimated 2-year progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) rates were 82.8% and 100.0%, respectively. Subgroup analysis revealed that patients with pleural tumor index (PTI) scores >10 had significantly worse PFS (p < 0.001).\n\nInterpretation: S-HITOC demonstrated a manageable complication rate and promising short-term oncological outcomes for TETs with pleural spread or recurrence. The study highlights the potential of S-HITOC in improving survival and controlling myasthenia gravis in this patient population. Trial registration: NCT05446935. Funding: Not specified.",
