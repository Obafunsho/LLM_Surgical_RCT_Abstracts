This study evaluates whether supplemental fluid administration during and after elective colon resections reduces postoperative wound infections.\n\nMethods: In this randomised controlled trial, patients undergoing open colon resection were randomly assigned to receive either small volume (8 mL·kg⁻¹·h⁻¹, n=124) or large volume (16-18 mL·kg⁻¹·h⁻¹, n=129) fluid management. The primary outcome was the incidence of surgical wound infections, diagnosed by purulent exudate with culture-positive pathogenic bacteria or CDC criteria, assessed by a blinded observer within 15 days post-surgery. Wound healing was evaluated using the ASEPSIS scoring system.\n\nResults: Of the small fluid group, 14 patients developed surgical wound infections, compared to 11 in the large fluid group (P=0.46). ASEPSIS scores were similar: 7±16 (small volume) vs. 8±14 (large volume), P=0.70. No significant adverse events were reported in either group.\n\nInterpretation: Supplemental hydration within the tested range does not significantly impact the rate of wound infections or wound healing scores in elective colon resection patients.\n\nTrial registration: [Trial registration number]\n\nFunding: [Source of funding]",
