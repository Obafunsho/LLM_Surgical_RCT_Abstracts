The primary outcome was the incremental cost-utility ratio (ICUR), expressed as cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained, measured over a 2-year period. Randomisation was conducted using a computer-generated sequence with allocation concealment. Blinding was not applicable due to the nature of the intervention. A total of 200 participants were randomised: 100 to early surgery and 100 to nonoperative care. Analysis was performed on an intention-to-treat basis.\n\nResults: Early surgery resulted in higher costs (CAD 4118) compared to nonoperative care (CAD 2377) but yielded better health outcomes (1.48 QALYs vs. 1.30 QALYs). The ICUR was CAD 5822 per QALY gained. The likelihood of cost-effectiveness at a willingness-to-pay threshold of CAD 50,000 was 0.99. No significant adverse events were reported in either group.\n\nInterpretation: Early surgical intervention for chronic lumbar radiculopathy is cost-effective compared to nonoperative care. Decision-makers should consider funding early surgical access in single-payer systems. Future research should explore the societal costs and clinical effectiveness of treatments for chronic radiculopathy.\n\nTrial registration: [Trial registration number]\n\nFunding: [Source of funding]",
