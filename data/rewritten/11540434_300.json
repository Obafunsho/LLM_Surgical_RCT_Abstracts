A meta-analysis was conducted, including randomised controlled trials and observational studies from three databases (PubMed, Scopus, CENTRAL) up to November 2022. The primary outcome was the rate of bacterial infections, and the secondary outcome was shunt failure. Odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated using a random-effects model. Randomisation and allocation concealment methods were not specified. Blinding details were not provided. The study included patients of all ages and etiologies of shunt implantation, with interventions being AISC and comparators being standard shunts.\n\nResults: A total of 27 articles with 27,266 shunt operations were included. The use of AISC was significantly associated with a reduction in infections (OR = 0.42; 95% CI: 0.33-0.54). There was a tendency towards reduced shunt failure with AISC use (OR = 0.73; 95% CI: 0.51-1.06). Adverse events were not reported. The analysis included both intention-to-treat and per-protocol approaches, but specific numbers for each group were not provided.\n\nInterpretation: The study provides evidence that AISC significantly reduces bacterial ventriculoperitoneal-shunt infections. There is also a tendency for AISC to decrease shunt failure compared to standard shunts. Further research is needed to confirm these findings, particularly in different subgroups such as age and sex. The study highlights the potential of AISC as a cost-effective treatment option.\n\nTrial registration: PROSPERO registration number not provided.\n\nFunding: Funding sources were not reported.",
