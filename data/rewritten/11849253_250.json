A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial on the Impact of Hyperosmolar Prime Solution on Cardiac Surgery Associated Acute Kidney Injury\n\nBackground: This study aimed to evaluate whether a Ringer’s acetate-based priming solution with Mannitol and sodium chloride increases the risk of cardiac surgery associated acute kidney injury (CSA-AKI).\n\nMethods: In this double-blind, prospective randomised controlled trial, 200 patients aged ≥65 years scheduled for routine cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass at a single tertiary teaching hospital in Sweden were randomised (1:1) to receive either a hyperosmolar prime solution (Ringer’s acetate 1000 mL + 400 mL Mannitol + sodium chloride 40 mL + heparin 2 mL, 966 mOsmol) or a control solution (Ringer’s acetate 1400 mL + heparin 2 mL, 388 mOsmol). Randomisation was computer-generated, and allocation was concealed. The primary outcome was CSA-AKI, defined by KDIGO criteria, assessed on day 1 in the ICU and day 3 postoperatively.\n\nResults: Of the 195 patients analysed (98 Mannitol, 97 Ringer), the incidence of CSA-AKI was 2.6% on day 1 and 5.6% on day 3. No significant intergroup differences in serum creatinine levels were observed. Hyperosmolality, patient age, and surgery duration were independent risk factors for CSA-AKI. No adverse events were reported.\n\nInterpretation: The hyperosmolar prime solution did not increase CSA-AKI incidence, but high plasma osmolality increased the risk by 30%. Further investigation into plasma hyperosmolality as a risk factor is warranted. Trial registration: NCT05914896. Funding: Not specified.",
