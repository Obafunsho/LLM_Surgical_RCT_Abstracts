This study evaluates the prognostic significance of LN size in EC patients.\n\nMethods: The UK MRC OE02 trial randomised 802 patients with locally advanced resectable EC to surgery alone (S) or neoadjuvant chemotherapy plus surgery (C+S) between 1992 and 1998. The primary outcome was 5-year overall survival (OS). LN size was assessed in 367 patients (188 S, 179 C+S) using hematoxylin-eosin stained sections. Randomisation was computer-generated, and allocation was concealed. Outcome assessors were blinded to treatment allocation.\n\nResults: Large LN size correlated with lower pN category (P = 0.01) and reduced lymphatic invasion (P = 0.02) in S patients. (y)pN0 patients with large LNs exhibited the best OS, while (y)pN1 patients had the poorest OS irrespective of LN size (P < 0.001). Large LNs contained fewer lymphocytes (P = 0.02) and had a higher germinal centers/lymphocyte ratio (P = 0.05). The study found no significant difference in LN size or its prognostic value between treatment arms.\n\nInterpretation: LN size may serve as a surrogate marker for the host antitumor immune response and a prognostic biomarker for (y)pN0 EC patients. These findings suggest that LN size could help identify patients who might benefit from additional postsurgical therapy. Further research is required to validate these results and investigate the biological mechanisms involved.\n\nTrial registration: Not provided.\n\nFunding: Not specified.",
