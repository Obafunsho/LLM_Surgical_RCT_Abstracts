This study evaluates the impact of CTR on clinical outcomes in patients undergoing left-sided valve procedures.\n\nMethods: A comprehensive literature search was performed using MEDLINE, EMBASE, Scopus, and Web of Science. Studies comparing outcomes of mitral/aortic valve surgery with or without CTR for functional TR were included. The primary outcome was cardiac mortality, while secondary outcomes included overall mortality, stroke, wound infection, reoperation, atrial fibrillation, renal failure, intensive care stay, and permanent pacemaker implantation. A random effects model was applied for statistical analysis.\n\nResults: The meta-analysis included 36 studies with a total of 76,249 patients. CTR was associated with a significant reduction in cardiac mortality (p < 0.0001) despite increased CPB (p < 0.00001) and X-Clamp times (p < 0.00001). There was no significant difference in overall mortality between the groups. Postoperative TR was significantly lower in the CTR group (p < 0.00001). No significant differences were found in postoperative stroke, wound infection, atrial fibrillation, renal failure, or intensive care unit stay duration.\n\nInterpretation: Concomitant tricuspid valve repair for moderate TR during left-sided valve surgery offers a survival advantage by significantly reducing cardiac mortality and late TR without increasing morbidity. The study highlights the potential benefits of CTR as a protective strategy in this patient population. Trial registration and funding information were not disclosed.",
