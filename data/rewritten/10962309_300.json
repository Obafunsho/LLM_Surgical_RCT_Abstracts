  "abstract": "300-word version:\n\nBackground: Cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) is a common technique in cardiac surgery but is associated with acute kidney injury (AKI), which carries considerable morbidity and mortality. This study evaluates the impact of CPB on AKI incidence and explores preventive strategies.\n\nMethods: This randomised controlled trial was conducted at a tertiary care hospital. Participants were adult patients undergoing cardiac surgery with CPB. Eligibility criteria included age 18-75 years and no pre-existing renal disease. Participants were randomised using a computer-generated sequence, with allocation concealed by sealed envelopes. Blinding was applied to outcome assessors. The intervention group received optimized CPB procedures, including adjustments in equipment parameters and surgical techniques, while the control group underwent standard CPB. The primary outcome was the incidence of AKI within 7 days post-surgery.\n\nResults: A total of 200 participants were randomised: 100 to the intervention group and 100 to the control group, between January 2020 and June 2021. Analysis included 98 participants in the intervention group and 97 in the control group, using an intention-to-treat approach. The intervention group showed a reduced AKI incidence (20% vs. 35%, p = 0.02), with a mean difference of 15% (95% CI 5% to 25%). No severe adverse events were reported; mild gastrointestinal side-effects occurred in 3% of the intervention group and 1% of the control group.\n\nInterpretation: Optimized CPB procedures significantly reduce AKI incidence in cardiac surgery patients. These findings suggest that targeted interventions during CPB can mitigate renal impairment. Further research is needed to refine these strategies and confirm their long-term benefits.\n\nTrial registration: NCT12345678.\n\nFunding: This study was funded by the National Institutes of Health.",
