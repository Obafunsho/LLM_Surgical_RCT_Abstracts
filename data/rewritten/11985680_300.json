This study aimed to elucidate the neural mechanisms underlying pain-depression comorbidity in PHN patients.\n\nMethods: Conducted at the Second Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine, this randomised controlled trial included 17 depressed PHN patients, 19 non-depressed PHN patients, and 34 healthy controls (HCs). Participants were right-handed and diagnosed with PHN. Resting-state functional MRI scans assessed fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (fALFF) and regional homogeneity (ReHo) values. The primary outcome was the difference in fALFF values in the right temporal lobe (TL) and its connectivity with the inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) over a 5-minute scan period. Randomisation and allocation concealment methods were not specified. Blinding was not mentioned.\n\nResults: One-way analysis of covariance showed significant differences in fALFF values in the right TL and its connectivity with the IFG among the three groups. The TL-IFG connectivity was positively associated with positive emotional scores and life quality scores in depressed PHN patients. No adverse events were reported.\n\nInterpretation: The study identifies TL dysfunction as a key factor in pain-depression comorbidity among PHN patients, offering potential central therapeutic targets to disrupt the pain-depression cycle. The absence of adverse events suggests the safety of the imaging procedures.\n\nTrial registration: Not provided.\n\nFunding: Not specified.",
