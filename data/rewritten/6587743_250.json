The primary outcome was CRC-specific mortality, with secondary outcomes including incidence, symptoms, tumour location, TNM categories, non-vital outcomes, and survival. Randomisation was stratified by birth year, sex, and residence. Outcome assessors were not blinded.\n\nResults: A total of 321,311 individuals were randomised, with 160,719 in the screening arm and 160,508 in the control arm. Analysis included 743 screening-detected and 617 control CRC cases. CRC was less common in women (0.34% vs. 0.50% in men; RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.74 to 0.91). Women more often had right-sided tumours (32.0% vs. 21.3% in men; RR 1.51, 95% CI 1.26 to 1.80). Among men with left-sided tumours, screening was associated with lower N and M categories and improved survival. No significant adverse events were reported.\n\nInterpretation: Biennial FOBT screening improved several outcomes in men but not in women, potentially due to differences in incidence, symptoms, and tumour location.
