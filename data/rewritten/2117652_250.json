A 250-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial of Deep Brain Stimulation in Treatment-Refractory Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder\n\nBackground: Deep brain stimulation (DBS) targeting the anterior limb of the internal capsule and nucleus accumbens has emerged as a potential treatment for medication-refractory obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). This study aims to explore the acute effects of DBS in this region.\n\nMethods: This randomised controlled trial involved five patients with chronic, severe treatment-refractory OCD. Each patient received DBS leads, with a total of ten leads tested. Participants were randomly assigned to receive either sham stimulation or active DBS, with the alternative condition tested 30 days later. The primary outcome was the acute response to stimulation, measured 30 days post-DBS placement. Randomisation was conducted using a computer-generated sequence, and allocation was concealed. Both patients and outcome assessors were blinded to the intervention.\n\nResults: A total of 845 stimulation trials were recorded, with 16% from sham stimulation and 17% from placebo (0 V stimulation). Non-mood-related responses were significantly associated with ventral lead contacts (p = 0.001). Physiological responses, such as autonomic changes and panic episodes, were also linked to ventral stimulation (p = 0.001). No significant side effects were associated with sham stimulation.\n\nInterpretation: The acute effects of DBS in the anterior limb of the internal capsule and nucleus accumbens provide insights into brain region localization and circuitry. The study highlights the potential of DBS as a reversible and blind intervention for OCD.\n\nTrial registration: [Trial registration number]\n\nFunding: [Source of funding]",
