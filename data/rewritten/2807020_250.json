A 250-word version\n\nTitle: A Randomised Controlled Trial Comparing Hip Resurfacing and Large-Head Total Hip Arthroplasty in Young and Active Patients with Hip Osteoarthritis\n\nBackground: Hip resurfacing (HR) is hypothesized to provide better functional outcomes than conventional total hip arthroplasty (THA) in young, active patients with hip osteoarthritis. This study aimed to compare HR with large-diameter femoral head THA.\n\nMethods: This double-blind, randomised controlled trial was conducted with 48 patients with hip osteoarthritis, eligible based on age and activity level, at a single orthopedic center. Participants were randomised to receive either HR or large-head THA. Randomisation was computer-generated, and allocation was concealed. Blinding included patients, clinicians, and outcome assessors. The primary outcome was gait speed, measured preoperatively and at 3, 6, and 12 months postoperatively. A third group of 14 healthy subjects served as controls.\n\nResults: Forty-eight patients were randomised: 24 to HR and 24 to large-head THA. All participants were analysed using an intention-to-treat approach. Gait speed and postural balance evaluations, functional tests, and clinical scores were similar between HR and large-head THA groups at all follow-up periods. Operated patients reached most control group values by 3 months postoperatively. No significant differences in adverse events were reported between groups.\n\nInterpretation: HR did not demonstrate superior clinical function over large-head THA in young, active patients with hip osteoarthritis.
