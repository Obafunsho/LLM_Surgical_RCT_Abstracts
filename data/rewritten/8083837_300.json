A 300-word version\n\nTitle: A Randomised Controlled Trial Comparing Short- and Standard-Length Stems in Cementless Total Hip Arthroplasty\n\nBackground: Short-length stems in cementless total hip arthroplasty (THA) aim to reduce proximal femur bone loss and decrease thigh pain. This study assesses the effectiveness of short stems compared to standard-length stems.\n\nMethods: This randomised controlled trial involved 100 patients undergoing primary THA, randomised to receive either a short stem (n = 56) or a standard-length stem (n = 44) from March 2013 to January 2014. Eligibility criteria included age ≥20 years, no prior hip surgery, and absence of metabolic bone disease. The primary outcome was the incidence of thigh pain over a 5-year follow-up. Randomisation was computer-generated, and allocation was concealed. Outcome assessors were blinded. Analysis was per-protocol.\n\nResults: Thigh pain was reported in 16% (9/56) of the short-stem group and 14% (6/44) of the standard-stem group (p = 0.79). The mean severity of thigh pain was similar between groups (4.3 ± 0.8 vs. 4.2 ± 0.7; p = 0.78). Modified Harris hip scores were not significantly different (89 ± 13 vs. 95 ± 7; p = 0.06). No implant loosening or revisions occurred. Bone mineral density changes were slightly less in the short-stem group but not clinically significant. No adverse events were reported in either group.\n\nInterpretation: No clinically important differences were found between short and standard-length stems in THA. Standard-length stems are recommended due to their established track record.\n\nTrial registration: [Trial registration number]\n\nFunding: [Source of funding]",
