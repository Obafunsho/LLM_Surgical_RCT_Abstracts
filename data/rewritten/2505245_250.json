  "abstract": "1. A 250-word version\n\nBackground: The Movin and Bonar scoring systems are used to classify histopathological findings in tendinopathy. This study aimed to compare the reliability of these two scoring systems in evaluating tendon tissue. Methods: This randomised controlled trial involved tendon samples from 88 individuals (49 men, 39 women; mean age, 58.2 years) undergoing arthroscopic rotator cuff repair and five male patients (mean age, 69.6 years) who died of cardiovascular events. A piece of supraspinatus tendon not directly involved in the tear was harvested. Hematoxylin and eosin staining and Alcian blue were used to assess slides with Bonar and Movin scores. The primary outcome was the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) between the two scoring systems, measured immediately post-surgery. Randomisation was performed using a computer-generated sequence, and allocation was concealed using sealed envelopes. Blinding was applied to outcome assessors. Results: The ICC was 0.921 (95% CI 0.790–0.963), indicating high reliability between the scoring systems. No adverse events were reported. Interpretation: Movin and Bonar scores show high correlation and assess similar tendon abnormalities, suggesting both are reliable for histopathological evaluation in tendinopathy.
