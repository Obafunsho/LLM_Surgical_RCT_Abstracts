SGM-101 was administered intravenously 4–6 days before surgery. The primary outcome was the change in the peritoneal carcinomatosis index (PCI) due to fluorescence imaging, measured intraoperatively. Randomisation and blinding details were not applicable as this was a pilot study.\n\nResults: A correct change in PCI due to fluorescence imaging was observed in 4 of the 14 patients. The median clinical PCI was 7, and the median fluorescence-based PCI (fPCI) was 6.5. SGM-101 was well tolerated, with no adverse events reported. The sensitivity and specificity of fluorescence imaging were 98.5% and 62.2%, respectively, with an accuracy of 85.4%.\n\nInterpretation: The use of SGM-101 in patients with peritoneally metastasized colorectal carcinoma is feasible and allows for intraoperative detection of tumor deposits, potentially altering the PCI and improving surgical outcomes. No trial registration or funding details were provided.",
