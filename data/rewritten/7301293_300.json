A 300-word version\n\nTitle: Randomised Controlled Trial on the Impact of Obesity and OSAS on Morphine Pharmacokinetics in Children\n\nBackground: Obesity and obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) are known to complicate perioperative pain management by potentially altering morphine pharmacokinetics. This study aims to evaluate the independent effects of obesity, OSAS, and leptin on morphine metabolism in children.\n\nMethods: This randomised controlled trial included children aged 5–12 years scheduled for surgery. Participants were randomised into three groups: nonobese with severe OSAS, obese with severe OSAS, and a control group. Each child received a morphine dose of 0.05 mg/kg. Blood samples were collected at baseline and at preset intervals for pharmacokinetic analysis. The primary outcome was the dose-adjusted mean maximum morphine concentration (C MAX ) over 540 minutes. Randomisation and allocation concealment methods were employed, and outcome assessors were blinded.\n\nResults: Thirty-four patients were randomised: 16 controls, 8 nonobese/OSAS, and 10 obese/OSAS. The obese/OSAS group showed a higher C MAX compared to controls (P < .001) and nonobese/OSAS (P = .014). They also had a lower volume of distribution (P = .007) and higher morphine 3-glucuronide (M3G) concentration (P = .012). Time to maximum morphine 6-glucuronide (M6G) concentration was shorter in both OSAS groups compared to controls (P < .005). Higher levels of CRP, IL-10, and leptin were observed in the obese/OSAS group. No adverse events were reported.\n\nInterpretation: The combination of obesity and OSAS significantly increases morphine metabolism in children, likely due to elevated leptin levels. These findings highlight the importance of considering tailored morphine dosing in this population to ensure effective pain management.\n\nTrial registration: [Trial registration number]\n\nFunding: [Source of funding]",
