Vertical sleeve gastrectomy (VSG) provided comparable hepatic benefits, significantly reducing liver fibrosis and steatosis in approximately 60% of patients. Adjustable gastric banding (AGB) demonstrated meaningful though comparatively modest hepatic improvements, with steatosis resolution in about 42% of patients. More aggressive procedures like biliopancreatic diversion with duodenal switch (BPD-DS) showed profound metabolic effects, though with increased nutritional risk. Endoscopic therapies, including intragastric balloon (IGB) and endoscopic sleeve gastroplasty (ESG), offered notable short- to medium-term hepatic improvements, significantly reducing steatosis and fibrosis markers."
