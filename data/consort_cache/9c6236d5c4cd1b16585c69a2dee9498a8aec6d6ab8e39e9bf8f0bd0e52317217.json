Compared to VCV, PCV-VG improved oxygenation (higher PaO2, PaO2/FiO2), reduced airway pressure (25 cmH2O to 20 cmH2O at T2, p<0.0001), and lowered PPCs incidence (38.5% to 7.3%, OR 0.13, 95% CI: 0.03\u20130.50, p=0.001). The duration of postoperative mechanical ventilation was shorter in the PCV-VG group (120 min to 110 min, difference 20, 95% CI 0 to 40, p=0.036)"
