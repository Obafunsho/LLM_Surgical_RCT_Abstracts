Upon distension, ventricular volumes increased by 852.4\u00b1639.8% after LV thinning, with an 89.5\u00b133.9% increase in sphericity index. Mitral valve systolic tenting height increased from 7.92\u00b12.06 mm to 15.02\u00b13.89 mm, systolic tethering area increased from 130.7\u00b138.2 mm 2 to 409.9\u00b1124.6 mm 2 and an average mitral regurgitation fraction of 24.4\u00b116.6% was measured."
