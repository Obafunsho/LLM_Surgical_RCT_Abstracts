        "evidence": "The primary outcome was the change in cardiovascular ANS functions, assessed by blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR) during rest and orthostatic conditions, heart rate variability (HRV), and breathing-induced cutaneous sympathetic vasoconstriction (CVC)."

        "evidence": "STN stimulation did not significantly alter cardiovascular ANS functions but significantly increased CVC. Conversely, levodopa significantly reduced BP and HR at rest and exacerbated orthostatic hypotension."
