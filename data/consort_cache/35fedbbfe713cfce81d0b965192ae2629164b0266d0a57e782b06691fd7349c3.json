        "score": 2,
        "evidence": "In the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU), patients in both ITM groups experienced significantly lower opioid consumption and pain scores compared to the control group (p<.001). Furthermore, cumulative OME at 24 hours was significantly less in the ITM groups compared to the control, but there was no difference between ITM doses (p=0.004; mean cumulative OME for control was 77.2 OME vs 43.4 OME for 100 mcg ITM vs 42.6 OME for 150 mcg ITM)."

      "Harms": {
        "score": 1,
        "evidence": "In addition, the safety and side effect profile for ITM is similar for both doses as there was no incidence of respiratory depression and antiemetic usage did not differ between all study arms."
