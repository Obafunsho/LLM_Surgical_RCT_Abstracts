Increased time to MT activation and time to arrival of first cooler were associated with increased mortality (OR 1.02, p=0.009 and OR 1.02, p = 0.012, respectively). Controlling for injury severity, physiology, resuscitation intensity, and treatment arm (1:1:1 vs. 1:1:2), increased time to arrival of first cooler was associated with an increased mortality at 24-hours (OR 1.05, p = 0.035) and 30-days (OR 1.05, p = 0.016)."
