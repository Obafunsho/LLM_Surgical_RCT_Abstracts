        "score": 3,
        "evidence": "Patients whose RC-AVF was created outside guideline recommendations demonstrated smaller arterial ( p < 0.001) and venous ( p < 0.001) diameters. Additionally, a higher percentage of these patients were on hemodialysis via CVC at the time of RC-AVF creation ( p = 0.041), as well as a higher incidence of 6-week AVF maturation failure ( p = 0.012) and long-term AVF failure ( p = 0.016). In ROC Curve analysis, a threshold of 2.75 mm was established for the RA (AUC: 0.647, p = 0.005) and 2.52 mm for the CV (AUC: 0.677, p = 0.001). Additionally, patients whose RC-AVF procedures adhered to guideline recommendations had a significantly lower risk of long-term RC-AVF failure (HR: 0.44, p = 0.012). This association lost significance after adjusting for cardiovascular risk factors and the presence of CVC at admission (HR: 0.69, p = 0.328). After full adjustment, only the CV remained an independent predictor of long-term successful RC-AVF (HR: 0.68, p = 0.026). In contrast, RA lost significance after adjusting for cardiovascular risk factors and the presence of CVC at admission (HR: 0.71, p = 0.086)."
