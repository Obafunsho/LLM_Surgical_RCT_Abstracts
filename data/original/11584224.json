However, there is a concern that peripheral nerve block may cause high intraoperative stress and anxiety to the patient because the surgery is performed under conscious conditions.\n\nDexmedetomidine is an α2 adrenergic receptor agonist. Unlike with other sedatives, patients who receive dexmedetomidine are easily aroused by stimulation, can communicate even while appropriately sedated, and have less respiratory depression. 5 , 6 Therefore, appropriate sedation with dexmedetomidine may reduce patient stress and anxiety. From a global perspective, it is not uncommon for plastic surgeons to perform surgery under self-administered anesthesia, depending on the surgical field and regional characteristics. 7 , 8 However, there are few reports on the use of dexmedetomidine in patient populations with DFU and CLTI. The authors perform surgery using peripheral nerve block under dexmedetomidine sedation for patients with DFU and CLTI. In this study, the authors investigated intraoperative stress and memory in these patients using a postoperative questionnaire and examined the safety of this procedure. Given the high risk of complications in patients with DFU and CLTI undergoing surgery, exploring alternative sedation methods that minimize respiratory and circulatory risks is crucial. Thus, the authors’ research provides valuable insights into a potentially safer and more effective sedation method for these high-risk patients. This study is targeted toward global health physicians who often work in environments where anesthesia providers are not readily available due to shortages of anesthesiologists, among other factors. It seeks to offer viable solutions for safe and effective sedation in such contexts.\n\nMETHODS\n\nThis study is a single-center, retrospective observational study. The subjects were 18 patients in whom dexmedetomidine was used during peripheral nerve block surgery for DFU and CLTI. The peripheral nerve block administration, sedation with dexmedetomidine, and patient monitoring were performed by the plastic surgeon. Peripheral nerve block was performed using an echo-guided nerve block needle. The tip of the needle and the nerve fiber were identified by echo imaging, and anesthetic was injected circumferentially around the nerve. The anesthetic comprised 15–20 mL of an equal dilution of 0.75% ropivacaine hydrochloride (Anapain) and 1% lidocaine hydrochloride (Xylocaine) for femoral nerve block and sciatic nerve block.\n\nDexmedetomidine was administered at an initial loading dose of 6 μg/kg/h for 10 minutes, followed by a maintenance dose of 0.2–0.4 μg/kg/h. Sedation levels were assessed every 10 minutes using the observer’s assessment of alertness/sedation (OAA/S) score on a 5-point scale from 5 (awake) to 1 (deeply sedated) (Table 1 ). 9 An OAA/S score of 3–4 represents a moderate level of sedation-analgesia and a score of 1–2 represents unconsciousness.\n\nPostoperatively, a questionnaire was used to evaluate intraoperative stress and memory. Intraoperative stress was assessed on a 6-point face scale (0: not at all, 1: a little, 2: a little more, 3: much more, 4: very high, and 5: unbearably high). Intraoperative memory was rated on a 5-point numeric scale (1: not at all, 2: almost none, 3: a little, 4: partial, and 5: all). Postoperative symptoms (eg, discomfort, nausea/vomiting, palpitations, and dizziness) were also surveyed.\n\nStatistical analysis was performed to identify patient factors associated with postoperative complications using EZR (Saitama Medical Center, Jichi Medical University, Saitama, Japan). EZR is a graphical user interface for R (The R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria, v. 4.1.2) that is a modified version of R commander (v. 2.7-1) with added functions frequently used in biostatistics. 10 Categorical variables were analyzed by the Fisher exact test, and continuous variables were evaluated by Mann-Whitney U test. All P values were 2-sided, and a P value of less than 0.05 was considered to be significant.\n\nThe study was performed in compliance with the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the research ethics committee of National Hospital Organization Takasaki General Medical Center (No. TGMC2024-028). Written informed consent was obtained from all subjects or their legal guardians.\n\nRESULTS\n\nThe patients (15 men and 3 women) had a mean age of 66.1 years (range: 41–81 y) (Table 2 ). There were 6 cases with DFU alone, 3 with CLTI alone, and 9 with both conditions. Anesthesia methods included sciatic nerve block in 14 cases, combined sciatic and femoral nerve block in 2 cases, and combined sciatic nerve block and local anesthesia in 2 cases. Five patients underwent toe amputation; 8 received foot amputation; 2 had below-knee amputation; and there was 1 case each of split-thickness skin graft, full-thickness skin graft, and debridement. The mean operative time was 78.9 minutes (range: 26–164 minutes).\n\nSedation levels ranged from OAA/S scores of 3 to 5, and no cases were oversedated. Intraoperative stress was 0: not at all (n = 10), 1: a little (n = 4), 2: a little more (n = 3), and 3: much more (n = 1). No cases had high intraoperative stress (4: very high or 5: unbearably high) (Fig. 1 ). Intraoperative memory was 1: not at all (n = 3), 2: almost none (n = 5), 3: a little (n = 9), and 4: partial (n = 1) (Fig. 2 ).\n\nOne patient complained of nausea as a postoperative symptom, but this improved with follow-up. Heart rate less than 50 bpm was considered to be bradycardia, and saturation of percutaneous oxygen less than 90% was defined as hypoxemia. Bradycardia occurred in 1 case but improved after adjusting the dexmedetomidine dosage. Hypoxemia occurred in 9 patients. Oxygenation was improved by adjusting the dexmedetomidine dose and encouraging deep breathing on call. In the statistical analysis, no correlations were found between specific comorbidities, types of surgery, or duration of surgery and adverse events. Only high body mass index (BMI) was significantly associated with hypoxemia ( P = 0.02) (Table 3 ).\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nSurgery under general anesthesia for patients with DFU and CLTI, who often have various complications, is risky due to possible effects on the circulatory and respiratory systems. 3 , 4 Epidural or spinal anesthesia may also cause circulatory instability from effects on the sympathetic nervous system, and many of the patients are receiving antithrombotic therapy due to complications of the coronary artery and cerebrovascular disease, and are at risk for hematoma formation. 11 In contrast, peripheral nerve block does not involve the sympathetic nervous system and has less effect on the cardiovascular system. Chelly and Schilling 12 retrospectively evaluated a total of 6935 peripheral nerve blocks in 3588 patients who underwent hip or knee arthroplasty. The procedures included lumbar plexus, femoral, and sciatic nerve block, and none resulted in postoperative hematoma formation. 12 Echo-guided sciatic and femoral nerve blocks are relatively shallow nerve blocks that have a low risk of hematoma formation and are relatively easy to apply in patients with coagulation dysfunction or difficulty with antithrombotic drug withdrawal.\n\nDexmedetomidine is an α2 adrenergic receptor agonist. In the central nervous system, binding of an α2 agonist to α2 receptors on the presynaptic membrane of noradrenergic neurons inhibits release of noradrenaline from nerve terminals by negative feedback, thereby suppressing sympathetic nerve activity. At the same time, binding of the agonist to α2 receptors in the postsynaptic membrane suppresses excitation of the postsynaptic membrane, which is also thought to suppress sympathetic activity. 13 Compared with other sedatives, patients treated with dexmedetomidine are easily aroused by stimulation, can communicate while appropriately sedated, and have less respiratory depression. 5 , 6 Dexmedetomidine has also been reported to potentiate the effects and prolong the duration of action of local and peripheral nerve anesthesia. 14 – 16 Thus, analgesia with peripheral nerve block and sedation with dexmedetomidine may reduce the burden and stress on patients and contribute to safer surgery, and there have been several reports showing the usefulness of this combination. 7 , 8 , 17 Dexmedetomidine is used in many hospitals and medical facilities in both developed and developing countries. Although dexmedetomidine is generally more expensive than propofol and midazolam, studies have shown that its overall cost can be lower when considering factors such as reduced mechanical ventilation time and lower incidence of delirium. 18 Additionally, in cardiac surgery, high-dose dexmedetomidine has been associated with reduced costs primarily through decreased postoperative respiratory failure and shorter hospital stays. 19 Furthermore, in thoracoscopic surgery, dexmedetomidine as an adjuvant to ropivacaine provided better pain control and shorter hospital stays compared with dexamethasone. 20 These studies suggest that dexmedetomidine can be a cost-effective option in various perioperative scenarios.\n\nIn this study, the degree of sedation was assessed using the OAA/S, in which sedation levels are rated on a 5-point scale from 5 (awake) to 1 (deeply sedated). An OAA/S score of 3 to 4 indicates that the patient is not uncomfortable or distressed and is able to communicate adequately. 7 Dexmedetomidine was administered as an initial loading dose at 6 μg/kg/h for 10 minutes, followed by maintenance dosing at 0.2–0.4 μg/kg/h, which resulted in appropriate sedation levels with OAA/S scores of 3 to 5. The mean intraoperative stress score was 0.72 (0: not at all, 1: a little) (range: 0–3), and the mean intraoperative memory score was 2.44 (2: almost none, 3: a little) (range: 1–4). These results suggest that peripheral nerve block of the lower extremities under dexmedetomidine sedation reduces patient burden and alleviates stress and anxiety during surgery.\n\nCommon complications of dexmedetomidine include bradycardia, hypotension, hypertension, and (less frequently than other sedatives) respiratory depression. 21 When these side effects occur, dexmedetomidine should be reduced or discontinued, and the patient should be stimulated or administered an appropriate drug or oxygen. In this study, 1 patient showed bradycardia and 9 had hypoxemia. Dexmedetomidine causes less respiratory depression than other sedatives, but airway obstruction and apnea have been noted in some studies. 22 , 23 Lodenius et al 24 found that dexmedetomidine was not superior to propofol for upper airway obstruction. In the current study, high BMI was significantly associated with hypoxemia ( P = 0.02) (Table 3 ). It is widely known that patients with a higher BMI have a higher risk of obstructive sleep apnea, 25 and those with a tendency for upper airway obstruction during sleep are also vulnerable during anesthesia and sedation. 26 Hypoxemia poses a risk of serious complications, making intraoperative monitoring extremely important. When a decrease in saturation of percutaneous oxygen is observed, the initial steps include awakening the patient through verbal stimulation and encouraging deep breathing. If necessary, oxygen administration via nasal cannula or mask should be considered. Additionally, reducing or discontinuing the dexmedetomidine dosage may be necessary. If upper airway obstruction due to tongue displacement is suspected, insertion of an oral or nasal airway should be considered. In addition to hypoxemia in patients with high BMI, older patients; those with cardiovascular disorders; and patients with reduced cardiac function, severe renal impairment, or hepatic dysfunction are also at higher risk of experiencing side effects. Therefore, it is necessary to consider measures such as reducing the initial loading dose and starting the maintenance dose at a lower level. Intraoperative monitoring should be conducted, and adjustments should be made as needed according to the patient’s condition.\n\nThe limitations of this study include the single-center design and small number of subjects. Although our findings provide preliminary insights into the use of dexmedetomidine in patients with DFU and CLTI, we recognize that further research with larger sample sizes is needed to validate these results and strengthen the conclusions. A large-scale, multicenter study is needed to validate the safety and examine complications of the surgical procedure.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nAppropriate sedation levels were obtained by controlling the dexmedetomidine dose in 18 patients with DFU and CLTI who underwent surgery using peripheral nerve block of the lower extremities under sedation with dexmedetomidine. Complications included bradycardia in one case and hypoxemia in 9 cases, all of which were mild and easily resolved. These results suggest that dexmedetomidine sedation and peripheral nerve block can reduce patient burden and alleviate stress and anxiety during surgery. However, dexmedetomidine may cause upper airway obstruction, especially in patients with a high BMI, and awareness of and countermeasures against hypoxemia are particularly important in these patients.\n\nDISCLOSURE\n\nThe authors have no financial interest to declare in relation to the content of this article.\n\nPATIENT CONSENT\n\nWritten informed consent was obtained from all subjects or their legal guardians.
