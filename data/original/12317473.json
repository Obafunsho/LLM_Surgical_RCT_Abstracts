  "full_text": "Introduction\n\nAcute kidney injury (AKI) is a serious complication after abdominal surgery, which has a rate of around 3–35% [ 1 ]. Postoperative AKI can lead to serious consequences, including the intensive care unit (ICU) admission, elevated risk of chronic kidney disease (CKD), and higher postoperative mortality rates [ 2 – 7 ]. Susantitang et al. [ 8 ] reported that the mortality rate among patients with postoperative AKI was 2.7 fold higher than in those without AKI over a six-month follow-up period. In addition, Bucaloiu et al. [ 9 ] demonstrated that patients with normal baseline renal function who developed reversible postoperative AKI had an increased risk of CKD during long-term follow-up, with a hazard ratio of 1.9. Thus, reducing the incidence of postoperative AKI is critical to prevent CKD and lower postoperative mortality rate. In clinical practice, up to 30% of hospital-acquired AKI cases can be prevented with prompt interventions and effective treatment strategies. However, the early diagnosis of AKI remains a challenge, limiting timely interventions [ 10 ]. Therefore, early identification of the risk factors for AKI may help clinicians implement preventive strategies and reduce the incidence and complications of postoperative AKI.\n\nPlatelets are small cytoplasmic fragments derived from mature megakaryocytes in the bone marrow. They participate in many biological processes, such as inflammation, immune defense, and tumor growth and metastasis [ 11 ]. Platelets also affect the endothelial vascular wall, for exxample, by altering vascular permeability and regulating hemodynamics [ 12 ]. A previous study demonstrated that a low platelet count measured two days before hemorrhagic shock was significantly correlated with AKI and 28-day all-cause mortality [ 13 ]. Similarly, another study found that a preoperative low platelet count was benefit for early detection of AKI in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting [ 14 ]. However, it remains unclear whether low preoperative platelet count is also a risk factor for postoperative AKI after abdominal surgery. Therefore, we explore the association between preoperative platelet count and postoperative AKI in patients who received abdominal surgery with general anesthesia at Seoul National University Hospital from January 2011 to December 2020.\n\nMethods and materials\n\nStudy population\n\nThe INformative Surgical Patient dataset for Innovative Research Environment database (INSPIRE) is a publicly available dataset for perioperative medical research. The INSPIRE dataset includes about 130,000 patients who accepted surgical anesthesia at Seoul National University Hospital between 2011 and 2020 [ 15 , 16 ]. The INSPIRE dataset received approval from the Institutional Review Board (IRB) of Seoul National University Hospital (SNUH, IRB No. H-2210-078-1368), in accordance with the 1964 Declaration of Helsinki and its later amendments. Due to the retrospective design of the study, the IRB waived the requirement for informed consent. All data in the INSPIRE dataset are freely available to the public, therefore, no additional ethical approval was required from a medical ethics committee. We obtained permission to access INSPIRE and extract relevant data. This study was performed according to the STROCCS statement (Strengthening the reporting of cohort studies in surgery) [ 17 ].\n\nThis was a single center, retrospective cohort study. In this study, diagnoses of coronary artery disease, heart failure, hypertension, diabetes, kidney failure, or CKD were indentified using International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10-CM) codes. The time of diagnosis relative to surgery and the first three digits of the ICD-10-CM code were recorded (all ICD-10-CM codes are provided in Supplementary Table S1). Through manual mapping, operation names were converted to the first four codes of ICD-10-PCS (on behalf of section, body system, root operation, and body part) to avoid re-identification (all disease ICD-10-PCS codes are provided in Supplementary Table S2). Patients were included if they had laboratory results of preoperative and postoperative serum creatinine (SCr) measurements and had undergone abdominal surgery For patients with multiple operations, only the first operation was included. The exclusion criteria were as follows: (1) Patients lacking height, weight, and ASA classification; (2) Those who did not undergo general anesthesia; (3) Patients with preoperative kidney failure or CKD; (4) Patientd with preoperative SCr ≥ 4 mg/dL; (5) Patients without preoperative platelet count measurements.\n\nData extractions\n\nData extraction was performed using Postgres SQL (version 15.0.3) and Navicat Premium (version 15.0.12). The following Patient variables were included: (1) Baseline demographics: age, sex, body mass index (BMI), ASA classification; (2) Comorbidities: preoperative diagnoses of hypertension, diabetes, coronary heart disease (CHD), heart failure; (3) Preoperative medications: usage of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), or β-blockers (yes/no); (4) Laboratory parameters: white blood cell count (WBC), lymphocyte count, hemoglobin, platelet count, SCr, albumin, total protein, potassium, calcium, phosphorus, chloride, sodium of the last measurement before surgery; (5) Intraoperative indicators: emergency surgery, surgical site, duration of surgery, pre-anesthesia blood pressure (systolic, mean, diastolic), intraoperative urine output, intraoperative blood loss, and the transfusions (red blood cells, platelets, plasma). Cases with missing values for these variables (except serum parameters) were excluded. The maximum percentage of missing data for all extracted variables did not exceed 20%, and multiple imputation methods were used to deal with missing data [ 18 ].\n\nAKI was identified based on changes in serum creatinine levels. The preoperative laboratory test result was defined as the latest measurement before surgery. The maximum measurements were recorded within 48 h and 7 days postoperatively. AKI was defined depending on the KDIGO criteria: an increment of creatinine ≥ 0.3 mg/dL within 48 h postoperatively or an increment of > 50% within 7 days postoperatively. Due to poor specificity and incomplete measurements in most cases, urine output was not used as a diagnostic criterion for AKI [ 19 ].\n\nStatistical analysis\n\nCategorical variables were presented as percentages, and analyzed using the chi-square test. Continuous variables were reported as mean ± standard deviation (SD), or median (interquartile range), and comparisons were made using student t-test or Mann-Whitney U tests, respectively.\n\nThe population of this study was classified into four groups according to preoperative platelet count quartiles. Logistic regression analysis was performed to evaluate the association between preoperative platelet count and postoperative AKI following abdominal surgery. We used the Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) to assess multicollinearity. We excluded covariates with VIF values exceeding 10 to address serious collinearity issues. A linear trend test was conducted using the median value of each quartile. The results of unadjusted (crude model), partial adjusted (model I), and fully adjusted (model II) analyses were also presented. The odds ratios (ORs) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated. Crude model was unadjusted; Model I was adjusted for age, sex, BMI, and ASA; Model II was fully adjusted for age, sex, BMI, ASA, emergency surgery, surgical site, operation time, coronary heart disease, hypertension, diabetes, heart failure, ACEI/ARBs usage, β-blocker use, RBC transfusion, platelet transfusion, plasma transfusion, albumin, total protein, blood urea nitrogen, calcium, chloride, creatinine, hemoglobin, lymphocyte count, white blood cell count, phosphorus, potassium, sodium, urine output, estimated blood loss, preoperative blood pressure.\n\nWe performed restricted cubic spline (RCS) analysis weighted at the 5th, 27.5th, 50th, 72.5th, and 95th percentiles to visualize the relationship between preoperative platelet count and postoperative AKI. The likelihood ratio test was adopted to evaluate nonlinearity. To investigate potential interactions between covariates and preoperative platelet count, we coonducted subgroup analyses. We calculated the interaction p-values between preoperative platelet count and stratifying factors to identify variables that might impact the relationship between preoperative platelet count and AKI. All statistical analyses for this study were performed using SPSS (version 21.0.0.0) and Stata/MP (version 18.0). P -value < 0.05 was regarded as statistically significant.\n\nResults\n\nBaseline characteristics\n\nA total of 8,144 patients who underwent abdominal surgery and had available preoperative and postoperative SCr measurements were initially enrolled in this study. For patients who underwent multiple surgeries, only data from the first surgical procedure were included. We excluded 380 patients with incomplete baseline information, 10 patients who did not receive general anesthesia, 182 patients with preoperative renal injury. 441 patients lacking preoperative platelet count measurements. After these exclusion, the final study cohort comprised 7,131 patients who underwent abdominal surgery under general anesthesia at Seoul National University Hospital were included (Fig. 1 ).\n\nThe cohort had a mean age of 59.56 ± 13.86 years and included 4,386 (61.5%) males. The median preoperative platelet count was 220 × 10 9 /L (weighted IQR, 177–271). 854 patients developed AKI within seven days postoperatively (supplementary file Table S3). Patients were classified into four quartiles according to preoperative platelet count (Table 1 ): Q1 ( n = 1902, Platelet ≤ 176), Q2 ( n = 1760, 176 < Platelet ≤ 220), Q3 ( n = 1804, 220 < Platelet ≤ 271), and Q4 ( n = 1665, Platelet > 271).\n\nOur analysis revealed that male patients exhibited a higher prevalence of preoperative low platelet count. Patients in the lowest platelet count quartile had the highest incidence of ASA class ≥ 3, emergency surgery, hypertension, diabetes, ACEI/ARBs use, β-blocker use, liver surgery, and intraoperative transfusions (including red blood cells, platelets, and plasma). Additionally, patients in this group had the highest level of preoperative serum BUN, SCr, intraoperative urine output and blood loss, and the lowest level of preoperative WBC count, serum albumin, total protein, calcium, phosphorus, and sodium concentration among four quartiles.\n\nLogistic regression analysis of AKI risk\n\nWe further analyzed the association between preoperative platelet count and postoperative AKI using three weighted logistic regression models (Table 2 ). In unadjusted model (crude model), the risk of postoperative AKI decreased significantly with the increasing platelet count ( P < 0.001). Patients in the highest platelet count quartile had a 50% lower AKI risk compared to the lowest quartile [OR = 0.50, 95% CI: 0.41–0.61]. In the partial adjusted model, relative odds ratios were [quartile 2, 0.71 (0.58–0.86)], [quartile 3, 0.67 (0.55–0.82)], and [quartile 4, 0.61 (0.49–0.75)] compared to the lowest quartile ( P for trend < 0.001). After fully adjusting for various factors during surgery (Model II), the relative odds ratios were [quartile 2, 0.89 (0.72–1.10)], [quartile 3, 0.83 (0.66–1.04)], and [quartile 4, 0.67 (0.52–0.86)] compared to the lowest quartile ( P for trend = 0.002).\n\nMultivariable adjusted restricted cubic spline analysis revealed a significant linear inverse relationship between preoperative platelet count and postoperative AKI risk (Fig. 2 ). The analysis indicated that the odds ratio for postoperative AKI increased significantly as preoperative platelet count decreased. A platelet count below 220 × 10⁹/L was associated with higher odds of AKI occurrence than non-occurrence.\n\nThe results of subgroup analyses\n\nTo identify variables that may affect the association between preoperative platelet count and postoperative AKI, we further perform stratified logistic regression analyses with interaction testing (Table 3 ). ASA grades IV and V were combined with grade III (categorized as ≥ 3) due to small sample sizes. Coronary heart disease (CHD) and heart failure comorbidities were merged into a single “heart disease” category. Surgical sites (spleen, appendix, abdominal wall hernia, and omentum) were grouped as “other” procedures.\n\nThe results of subgroup analysis showed that no statistically significant interaction effects were obseved across any subgroup (all P for interaction > 0.05). A stronger association between preoperative platelet count and the risk of postoperative AKI was found in specific high-risk populations, including patients over 60 years of age, male individuals, those with BMI > 18 or ASA class ≥ 3, and those undergoing elective hepatic or gastric procedures. This association was further accentuated in patients devoid of common comorbidities (hypertension, diabetes, or cardiovascular disease) and those not receiving preoperative β-blockers/ACEI/ARB therapy or intraoperative plasma transfusions.\n\nDiscussion\n\nOur study found that the incidence of postoperative AKI progressivvely increased with decreasing preoperative platelet counts across four quartile groups. Logistic regression analysis revealed a consistent inverse association between preoperative platelet count and the incidence of postoperative AKI, both in unadjusted and covariate-adjusted models. A trend that persisted after comprehensive covariate adjustment across three distinct statistical models. This indicated that our model was very stable and low preoperative platelet count was a risk factor for postoperative acute kidney injury. In addition, restrict cubic plane analysis further confirmed this negative correlation. Notably, when preoperative platelet counts fell below 220 × 10 9 /L, the risk of postoperative AKI increased significantly.\n\nThe development of AKI initiates a cascade of pathophysiological events, beginning with disruption of renal microcirculation that precipitates a sharp decline in glomerular filtration rate. Subsequent restoration of microcirculatory flow paradoxically induces ischemia-reperfusion injury, triggering a systemic inflammatory response that exacerbates renal dysfunction [ 20 , 21 ]. As the most abundant anucleate blood components, platelets serve dual roles in both hemostasis and immune modulation. Clinical evidence has established associations between thrombocytopenia and various inflammatory conditions, including sepsis, rheumatoid arthritis, and systemic lupus erythematosus [ 22 – 24 ]. Beyond their classical coagulation functions, platelets actively maintain endothelial integrity while participating in immune surveillance. Following endothelial injury, activated platelets release numerous cytokines that mediate complex interactions with leukocytes and vascular endothelial cells, thereby promoting microthrombus formation [ 25 ]. Furthermore, platelets can initiate complement activation and enhance leukocyte-mediated inflammatory responses, creating a pro-inflammatory milieu that accelerates AKI progressionI [ 26 ]. In the perioperative context, observed reductions in platelet counts may reflect either pre-existing inflammatory states or subclinical microthrombotic processes in high-risk patients [ 27 ].\n\nEmerging evidence suggests that thrombocytopenia may serve as an early marker of progressive inflammatory responses and is significantly associated with major adverse kidney events [ 28 ]. This association has been consistently demonstrated across multiple clinical contexts. Yihan Zhang et al. [ 26 ] utilized machine learning analysis of 780 liver transplantation cases to establish low preoperative platelet count as a critical risk factor for post-transplant AKI. Similarly, in a study of 123 consecutive pulmonary endarterectomy patients, Congya Zhang et al. [ 27 ] confirmed platelet count as an independent predictor of postoperative AKI. Further supporting these findings, Wu et al. [ 13 ] identified that thrombocytopenia occurring two days prior to hemorrhagic shock could predict both AKI development and 28-day all-cause mortality. The underlying pathophysiology likely involves systemic inflammation and microthrombus formation, which deplete circulating platelets and subsequently impair renal microvascular function, thereby increasing susceptibility to AKI. These collective findings underscore the importance of clinical vigilance in patients presenting with preoperative thrombocytopenia, as it may signify heightened risk for postoperative renal complications.\n\nWhile numerous studies have established the association between preoperative platelet count and postoperative AKI risk across various surgical procedures [ 14 , 27 ], the specific relationship in abdominal surgeries remains unexplored. As we know, this is the first study to explore the risk of AKI associated with preoperative platelet count following abdominal operations. When preoperative platelet counts below 220 × 10 9 /L, the risk of developing postoperative AKI significantly increases. This threshold differs from the 121 × 10⁹/L nadir platelet count identified by Miklos D. Kertai [ 14 ] for coronary artery bypass grafting, where each 30 × 10⁹/L platelet decrease corresponded to a 14% AKI risk increment. These variations likely reflect differences in surgical type, timing, and laboratory assessment methods. To identify variables that might affect the association between preoperative platelet count and postoperative AKI, we conducted subgroup analyses, which showed that none of the stratified variables affected this association. In our study, the risk of postoperative AKI demonstrated a significant negative association with changes in preoperative platelet count among patients undergoing liver or stomach surgery. This finding indicates that greater attention should be paid to patients undergoing liver or stomach surgery who have low preoperative platelet counts, as they are at higher risk for postoperative AKI. Previous studies have identified factors such as hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, use of ACEI/ARB or β-blockers, and intraoperative blood transfusions as associated with a higher incidence of AKI [ 3 , 29 – 33 ]. Thus, Therefore, physicians should be vigilant in preventing postoperative AKI in patients with these risk factors who also have low preoperative platelet counts.\n\nOur study has several strengths. Firstly, we employed RCS curve analysis to identify the threshold for preoperative platelet count in predicting postoperative AKI, providing valuable guidance for clinical practice. Secondly, we strictly adjusted for potential confounders, which enhanced the reliability of our findings. Lastly, we converted platelet count into a categorical variable and conducted sensitivity analyses to ensure the stability of the results. However, there are several limitations to consider. We were unable to obtain urine output data; thus, AKI was determined solely based on changes in SCr. The absence of urine output criteria may have led to an underestimation of the postoperative AKI incidence.Furthermore,, despite adjusting for covariates, the influence of unidentified or unmeasured confounding factors cannot be excluded. Finally, as this was a single-center study, the results need to be validated through a multi-center study.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn conclusion, a low preoperative platelet count is associated with an increased risk of AKI following abdominal surgery. Our findings indicate a significant negative correlation between preoperative platelet count and the risk of developing postoperative AKI, with the probability of postoperative AKI significantly increasing when preoperative platelet count falls below 220 × 10 9 /L. These results suggest that preoperative platelet count may serve as a biomarker for predicting postoperative AKI in patients undergoing abdominal surgeries.\n\nSupplementary Information\n\nSupplementary Material 1.\n\nSupplementary Material 2.\n\nSupplementary Material 3.
