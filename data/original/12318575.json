  "title": "Efficacy of enhanced preoxygenation protocols in mitigating hypoxemia during propofol sedation for gastrointestinal endoscopic procedures: a prospective, randomized, controlled study",
  "abstract": "Hypoxemia during propofol sedation for gastrointestinal endoscopic procedures is a significant risk and is often exacerbated by inadequate preoxygenation. Effective preoxygenation strategies are essential for reducing the incidence of hypoxemia, especially in high-risk patients. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of an enhanced preoxygenation protocol for mitigating hypoxemia during propofol sedation during gastroscopy. In a prospective, randomized, controlled design, patients undergoing gastroscopy were assigned to either an intervention group (enhanced preoxygenation) or a nonintervention group (standard care). The intervention protocol involved the administration of eight tidal volume breaths over 1 minute at an oxygen flow rate of 10 L/min via a tight-fitting face mask, with clinical supervision by an endoscopy nurse. The primary outcome was the incidence of hypoxemia, defined as a peripheral oxygen saturation level of less than 90% at any point during the gastroscopy procedure. Compared with the nonintervention group, the intervention group had a significantly lower incidence of hypoxemia. This effect was particularly pronounced in high-risk patients, including elderly individuals and those with elevated body mass indices. No significant adverse events were observed during the procedure. These results suggest that enhanced preoxygenation may effectively alleviate the occurrence of hypoxemia during propofol sedation in gastrointestinal endoscopic procedures. Further research is needed to assess the broader applicability of this approach and explore additional strategies for optimizing preoxygenation in endoscopic procedures.",

  "full_text": "Introduction\n\nHypoxemia during sedation remains a persistent and significant challenge in the dynamic clinical environment of endoscopy centers. This complication is particularly pronounced in high-risk patient populations, such as elderly individuals and those with obesity, who frequently exhibit diminished physiological reserves. 1 2 3 The susceptibility to oxygen desaturation is heightened in these patients, which is attributable to reduced functional residual capacity, compromised gas exchange mechanisms, and heightened oxygen demand. 4 5 6 Hypoxemia during sedation is not only prevalent but also potentially severe, with reported incidence rates ranging from 15% to 54%. This variation underscores the influence of diverse patient characteristics, procedural complexities, and inconsistencies in sedation protocols across healthcare settings. 2 7 8 9\n\nVarious interventions have been proposed to mitigate the risk of hypoxemia, including the utilization of nasopharyngeal airways to alleviate upper airway obstruction and the implementation of high-flow nasal oxygen therapy for continuous oxygen supplementation. 10 11 While effective in certain scenarios, these approaches often require additional expertise, resources, or specialized equipment.\n\nPreoxygenation, defined as the deliberate administration of supplemental oxygen prior to sedation, is a simple, cost-effective, and widely applicable method for addressing the risk of hypoxemia. By enhancing oxygen reserves, preoxygenation delays the onset of desaturation during apnea or airway obstruction, thereby mitigating the risk of hypoxemia. 12 13 Research has consistently highlighted the benefits of preoxygenation, particularly in high-risk populations. In obese patients, whose baseline risk of desaturation is significantly elevated owing to reduced lung compliance and increased oxygen demand, preoxygenation has been shown to substantially extend the safe apnea period by over 200 seconds. 13 14 Similarly, in elderly patients or those with respiratory comorbidities, effective preoxygenation reduces the incidence of critical hypoxemia during sedation, thereby improving overall procedural safety. 15 16 17 18\n\nAmong the various techniques, the use of a nonrebreather face mask (FM) has demonstrated superior efficacy by delivering a high fraction of inspired oxygen levels, optimizing oxygenation prior to sedation. 7 These findings have been integrated into sedation-related clinical guidelines, which emphasize preoxygenation as a foundational step in ensuring patient safety. 19 20 21 22\n\nDespite the robust evidence supporting preoxygenation, its implementation in clinical practice remains inconsistent, particularly in high-volume endoscopy centers. 23 24 A study indicated that approximately 56% of anesthesia inductions are characterized by inadequate preoxygenation, resulting in suboptimal outcomes. 25 Time constraints in busy endoscopy units frequently impede the execution of thorough preoxygenation protocols. Moreover, the absence of standardized, practical guidelines tailored for endoscopic procedures and the lack of reliable and readily accessible metrics to assess preoxygenation adequacy exacerbate variability in practice.\n\nIn light of these circumstances, our study sought to address these challenges by evaluating the efficacy of the supervised, protocol-driven enhanced preoxygenation strategy specifically designed for sedated gastroscopy. This approach uses a nonrebreather FM with an oxygen flow rate of 10 L/min and incorporates eight tidal volume breaths under the supervision of trained endoscopy nurses. By combining standardization with clinical oversight, the protocol aims to increase patient safety and procedural efficiency while overcoming the limitations of current practices.\n\nMethods\n\nThis single-center, nonblinded, randomized controlled trial was conducted at Shanghai Changhai Hospital, a tertiary care institution, between November and December 2024. The study adhered to the ethical principles outlined in the Declaration of Helsinki and was registered in the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (No. ChiCTR2400091389). Ethical approval was obtained from the Shanghai Changhai Hospital Medical Ethics Committee (approval No. CHEC2024–343) on October 9, 2024. The trial followed the CONsolidated Standards Of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) guidelines to ensure methodological rigor and transparency ( Additional file 1 ). 26\n\nSubjects\n\nEligible participants were adults scheduled for elective, diagnostic, and sedated gastroscopy at the Changhai Digestive Endoscopy Center. The inclusion criteria included adults aged 18–75 years, with an American Society of Anesthesiologists Physical Status (ASA-PS) classification of I to III, and a body mass index (BMI) greater than 18.5 kg/m².\n\nThe exclusion criteria were as follows: active upper respiratory infections, chronic pulmonary diseases (e.g., asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), a history of alcohol or substance abuse, known or suspected airway obstruction, or any condition that could impair the ability to maintain a proper mask seal (e.g., facial hair or edentulism). Pregnant women were excluded from this study.\n\nDemographic and baseline characteristics, including age, sex, BMI, and ASA-PS classification, were recorded for all participants. Additionally, stop-bang score and modified Mallampati score were used to assess potential airway difficulties and obstructive sleep apnea risk. The stop-bang score is a screening tool for obstructive sleep apnea that assesses risk based on factors such as snoring, tiredness, observed apneas, high blood pressure, BMI, age, neck circumference, and male sex. A score ≥ 3 indicates high risk. The modified Mallampati score is used to predict the difficulty of intubation by evaluating the visibility of oropharyngeal structures. It ranges from Class 1 (full visibility) to Class 4 (only the hard palate is visible). These scores were recorded as part of the baseline characteristics to assess potential airway difficulties and obstructive sleep apnea risk in our study population.\n\nInformed consent was obtained from all participants or their legally authorized representatives prior to enrollment. Additionally, patients were excluded if they were unable to comply with or tolerate the preoxygenation protocol or if the gastroscopic procedure was anticipated to exceed 10 minutes in duration.\n\nRandomization and blinding\n\nParticipants were randomly assigned to either the intervention or nonintervention group at a 1:1 ratio. Randomization was performed by an independent statistician using a computer-generated random number sequence. To ensure allocation concealment, group assignments were placed in sealed, opaque envelopes, which were opened sequentially by an independent staff member.\n\nThis study was not blinded due to the nature of the intervention, as the preoxygenation method was immediately apparent to clinicians. However, to minimize potential bias, anesthesiologists, endoscopists, and nursing staff in the nonintervention group were blinded to the study objectives. Independent researchers, who were unaware of group allocation, performed the data collection and outcome assessments.\n\nSample size calculation\n\nThe sample size was calculated based on the expected difference in hypoxemia rates between the intervention and nonintervention groups. A previous pilot study indicated that hypoxemia occurred in 25% of patients in the nonintervention group compared with 11% in the intervention group. Assuming a statistical power of 90% (power = 0.90), a significance level of 0.05 ( α = 0.05), and an anticipated dropout rate of 5%, the sample size was determined using PASS 21.0.3 software (NCSS, LLC, Kaysville, UT, USA). Based on these parameters, the required sample size was calculated to be 163 patients per group, yielding a total of 326 participants.\n\nSedation protocol\n\nPrior to the procedure, all the participants fasted for no less than eight hours. They were placed in the left lateral decubitus position, and intravenous access was established. Monitoring included noninvasive blood pressure, electrocardiography, and peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO 2 ).\n\nIn the intervention group, preoxygenation was performed by anesthesiologists and supervised by an endoscopy nurse, following the enhanced preoxygenation protocol. This protocol was developed in consultation with endoscopists and nurse practitioners to meet the needs of fast-paced endoscopy units. Eight vital capacity breaths (VCBs) were administered for 1 minute at an oxygen flow rate of 10 L/min through a tight-fitting FM connected to an anesthesia machine via a breathing circuit ( Figure 1 ). This method was selected for its efficiency in achieving high oxygen concentrations, thereby optimizing oxygen reserves prior to sedation.\n\nIn the nonintervention group, preoxygenation was performed by anesthesiologists according to their standard practices without any supervision. Anesthesiologists were blinded to the study objectives, and a researcher who was not involved in the preoxygenation process documented the data. The personnel in the intervention group received offline training covering the theoretical and practical aspects of preoxygenation, including oxygenation strategies, assessment methodologies, and relevant clinical guidelines. The nonintervention group did not receive any such training.\n\nAfter preoxygenation, supplemental oxygen was administered to all participants at 4 L/min via a nasal cannula (NC) until full recovery. Sedation was administered by anesthesiologists via a single-agent protocol with propofol (1.5–2.5 mg/kg), targeting a Modified Observer’s Assessment of Alertness/Sedation score of less than 2 for deep sedation. 27 28 If sedation was deemed inadequate, as indicated by patient movements, an additional bolus of 30 mg propofol was administered to maintain the target sedation depth.\n\nAirway intervention protocol\n\nAirway interventions were systematically implemented upon the emergence of hypoxemia following a structured escalation protocol.\n\n1. SpO 2 < 90% for up to 10 seconds: Propofol was temporarily suspended, the oxygen flow was increased, and the jaw was manipulated to ensure airway patency.\n\n2. SpO 2 < 90% for over 10 seconds: If desaturation persisted beyond 10 seconds, chest compressions were applied to facilitate respiration. 29\n\n3. SpO 2 < 75%: The endoscopic procedure was immediately halted, and the endoscope was withdrawn to enable oxygen delivery via an FM with positive pressure.\n\n4. Persistent hypoxemia unresponsive to the above interventions: If hypoxemia remained unresolved after the above measures, advanced airway management was initiated, which may include the placement of a laryngeal mask airway or endotracheal intubation as clinically indicated.\n\nThis stepwise approach ensured that airway interventions were progressively escalated according to the severity of desaturation, thereby prioritizing patient safety and minimizing hypoxemia-related complications during the procedure.\n\nOutcome measures\n\nThe primary outcome of this study was the incidence of hypoxemia, which was operationally defined as an SpO 2 level < 90% at any point during the gastroscopy procedure. The secondary outcomes included the latency to the initial episode of hypoxemia, nadir SpO 2 value recorded, and frequency of airway interventions needed.\n\nThe latency to the first hypoxemic event was assessed to evaluate the efficacy of preoxygenation in maintaining optimal oxygen saturation levels throughout the endoscopic procedure. The nadir SpO 2 value served as an indicator of the severity of the hypoxemic episodes. The frequency of airway interventions was used as a measure of the prevalence of severe hypoxemia and potential associated complications during the procedure.\n\nAdditionally, patient demographics, baseline vital signs, and comorbidities were meticulously documented to facilitate subgroup analyses. These analyses focused on high-risk patient populations, such as those with advanced age or elevated BMI, to elucidate the variations in preoxygenation efficacy across diverse patient profiles, particularly those predisposed to respiratory compromise.\n\nStatistical analysis\n\nAll the statistical analyses were conducted using R software (version 4.2.2; https://www.r-project.org ) and MSTATA software (version 0.93; www.mstata.com ). Two-tailed tests were applied, with statistical significance defined at α = 0.05 and a 95% confidence interval ( CI ). Descriptive statistics were calculated for baseline characteristics, with continuous variables presented as mean ± standard deviation for normally distributed data or as medians with interquartile ranges (IQRs) for nonnormally distributed data. Categorical variables were expressed as frequencies (percentages). Missing data were handled using multiple imputation techniques.\n\nFor group comparisons of continuous variables, Student’s t test was used for normally distributed data, whereas the Mann–Whitney U test was used for nonnormally distributed data. Categorical variables were compared via the chi-square test or Fisher’s exact test, depending on the expected frequency within each category.\n\nTo mitigate the impact of confounding variables, such as age and BMI, on the incidence of hypoxemia, subgroup analyses were performed using propensity score matching with standardized mean differences (SMDs). Propensity scores were calculated using logistic regression for 1:1 nearest-neighbor matching, with a caliper width set at 0.2. An SMD threshold of less than 0.1 was employed to indicate a well-balanced match post-adjustment. Additionally, post-hoc subgroup analyses utilizing multivariate logistic regression were conducted to examine the relationships between various factors and the incidence of hypoxemia.\n\nResults\n\nDemographic and clinical characteristics\n\nDuring the enrollment period from November 1 to November 23, 2024, a cohort of 344 consecutive participants who were scheduled for sedated gastroscopy were evaluated for eligibility. Following a rigorous screening process, 18 patients were excluded, leading to a total of 326 patients who were randomly allocated to either the intervention group ( n = 163) or the nonintervention group ( n = 163).\n\nIn the intervention group, one patient was excluded for mask ventilation intolerance, another for residual food in the stomach, and six for procedures over 10 minutes, resulting in 155 for the final analysis. In the nonintervention group, one patient experienced a delay attributed to hypertension, another was canceled for residual food in the stomach, and eight exceeded 10 minutes, resulting in 153 for final analysis. Overall, 308 patients were included in the final analysis, as shown in Figure 2 , and their demographic and clinical characteristics are presented in Table 1 .\n\nDetails of the procedures\n\nIn the nonintervention group, preoxygenation was facilitated through the NC at various oxygen flow rates, ranging from 2 to 10 L/min, resulting in a fraction of inspired oxygen between 29% and 61%. Among the 152 patients in this group, the majority utilized tidal volume breaths, whereas one patient received VCB. In contrast, the intervention group underwent preoxygenation under the supervision of an endoscopy nurse, following a standardized protocol of eight VCBs over 1 minute at an oxygen flow rate of 10 L/min through a tight-fitting FM.\n\nThe median duration of preoxygenation was similar between the two groups, with a duration of 1.00 (1.00, 1.00) minutes for the intervention group and 1.00 (0.80, 1.70) minutes for the nonintervention group, with no statistically significant difference ( P = 0.485). The median duration of the gastroscopy procedure was uniformly 4.5 minutes across both groups, with no significant intergroup variation detected ( P = 0.843). However, a higher median dose of propofol was administered in the intervention group, with a median of 200 (200, 250) mg, than in the nonintervention group, with a median of 200 (175, 230) mg, which was statistically significant ( P < 0.001). Further procedural details are delineated in Table 2 .\n\nHypoxemia\n\nIn the present study, hypoxemia was observed in 10 out of 155 patients (6.5%) in the intervention group and 34 out of 153 patients (22.0%) in the nonintervention group. The disparity in hypoxemia rates between the two cohorts was statistically significant ( P < 0.001), indicating that the intervention was associated with a markedly reduced risk of hypoxemia.\n\nThe temporal onset of hypoxemia was also delayed in the intervention group. The mean time to hypoxemia onset was 207.3 ± 46.65 seconds in the intervention group, whereas it was 124.3 ± 62.79 seconds in the nonintervention group ( P < 0.001). This finding suggests that the intervention effectively postponed the onset of hypoxemia, providing a more extended timeframe for the implementation of corrective measures and potentially enhancing patient outcomes.\n\nThe nadir SpO 2 values were significantly higher in the intervention group, with a median SpO 2 of 98% (96%, 99%) compared with 95% (90%, 98%) in the nonintervention group ( P < 0.001). These results imply that the intervention may be instrumental in sustaining higher oxygen saturation levels throughout the procedure, thereby reducing the likelihood of severe hypoxemic episodes and minimizing the need for invasive airway interventions.\n\nAdditionally, the frequency of airway interventions was significantly lower in the intervention group, with only 5.8% of patients requiring airway management compared with 21.0% in the nonintervention group (P < 0.001). This indicates that fewer patients in the intervention group required invasive procedures, such as intubation or other airway interventions, further substantiating the efficacy of the intervention in mitigating respiratory complications.\n\nAfter adjusting for age and BMI using propensity score matching, the incidence of hypoxemia was significantly lower in the intervention group (6.0%) than in the nonintervention group (24.1%) ( P < 0.001), suggesting a potential beneficial effect of the intervention on hypoxemic outcomes. This finding indicates that the intervention is highly effective in reducing the incidence of hypoxemia, regardless of age or BMI disparities between the groups. Table 3 presents the SMD for age and BMI between the intervention and nonintervention groups before and after matching, demonstrating a reduction in covariate imbalance post-matching, although the SMD for BMI remains marginally above the recommended threshold of 0.1.\n\nSubgroup analyses\n\nSubgroup analyses revealed that the preoxygenation optimization strategy conferred protective effects across various ages and BMI categories, with significant reductions in hypoxemia observed in several subgroups.\n\nAge\n\nNonelderly group (aged < 60 years): The intervention reduced the incidence of hypoxemia, yielding an odds ratio ( OR ) of 0.22 (95% CI : 0.07–0.68; P = 0.008), indicating a significant protective effect against hypoxemia in younger patients.\n\nElderly group (aged ≥ 60 years): The intervention manifested pronounced efficacy in elderly individuals, with an OR of 0.13 (95% CI : 0.04–0.45; P = 0.001), suggesting a robust reduction in hypoxemia risk among older patients. The P value for the interaction between age subgroups was 0.538, indicating that there was no statistically significant difference in the intervention effect between the nonelderly and elderly groups.\n\nBMI\n\nNormal weight (BMI < 25 kg/m²): The intervention significantly reduced hypoxemia, with an OR of 0.21 (95% CI : 0.07–0.64) ( P = 0.006).\n\nOverweight (25 ≤ BMI < 28 kg/m²): The intervention had a protective effect, with an OR of 0.11 (95% CI : 0.01–1.01) ( P = 0.051), which was close to statistical significance.\n\nObesity (BMI ≥ 28 kg/m²): The intervention tended to reduce hypoxemia, with an OR of 0.20 (95% CI : 0.04–1.07) ( P = 0.06), although this result did not reach statistical significance. The P value for the interaction between BMI subgroups was 0.883, indicating that the intervention had a similar effect across all BMI categories.\n\nForest plot analysis\n\nThe results of the subgroup analyses, as depicted in the forest plots, visually confirmed the protective effect of the intervention across both age and BMI categories. The forest plot clearly demonstrated that the intervention consistently reduced the risk of hypoxemia in all subgroups, with the effect being most pronounced in nonelderly individuals and those with a normal weight. The overall consistency of these findings across the subgroups highlights the robustness of the intervention’s efficacy. Further details can be seen in the forest diagram presented in Figure 3 .\n\nDiscussion\n\nOur study provides robust evidence that the enhanced preoxygenation protocol significantly mitigates both the incidence and severity of hypoxemia during propofol sedation for gastroscopy. This improvement is particularly notable in high-risk subgroups, such as elderly individuals and individuals with elevated BMIs. Unlike prior studies reporting higher rates of hypoxemia, our findings highlight the effectiveness of enhanced preoxygenation practices. These findings underscore the broad applicability of the intervention and its potential to improve patient safety during procedural sedation.\n\nThe practices observed in the nonintervention group closely mirrored typical clinical routines. Anesthesiologists often favor the use of NC for preoxygenation, as this is the standard mode of oxygen delivery during gastroscopy. However, the variability in the oxygen flow rates associated with NC leads to significant inconsistencies in the delivered oxygen concentrations during preoxygenation. The variability in oxygen flow rates in the control group, ranging from 2 to 10 L/min, reflects real-world clinical practice, where anesthesiologists responsible for sedation have different preferences, making it challenging to standardize oxygen flow rates. This approach was intentionally chosen to simulate diverse clinical settings and practices, ensuring that our study results are more representative of actual clinical scenarios. While this variability may introduce some inconsistency in preoxygenation effects, it provides a more accurate reflection of the challenges faced in routine clinical practice. These inconsistencies, combined with the inherent limitations of NC, contribute to suboptimal oxygenation and a markedly higher incidence of hypoxemia in the nonintervention group. This observation highlights a critical gap in current practice, where the convenience of using NC during procedures may inadvertently compromise the adequacy of preoxygenation. This observation calls for a re-evaluation of routine preoxygenation practices, emphasizing the need for implementing standardized, effective protocols to reduce the risk of hypoxemia, particularly in high-risk patient populations.\n\nA key advancement in this study is the marked reduction in the incidence of hypoxemia to 6.5%, emphasizing that standardized and properly implemented preoxygenation protocols can substantially increase patient safety during endoscopic procedures. Hypoxemia remains a common and potentially severe complication of procedural sedation, and this protocol offers a practical and effective solution. Additionally, our study highlights the often overlooked but critical role of clinical supervision during preoxygenation. In many fast-paced clinical settings, a lack of consistent oversight can lead to variable application of preoxygenation techniques, ultimately diminishing the effectiveness of the intervention. By incorporating consistent supervision into our protocol, we ensure both adherence to best practices and the optimization of patient outcomes, highlighting the importance of oversight in improving procedural safety and consistency.\n\nOur findings also underscore the critical importance of preoxygenation assessment in preventing hypoxemia during sedation, particularly in nonoperating room settings such as endoscopy centers, where advanced monitoring tools such as end-tidal oxygen concentration measurements are often unavailable. Effective preoxygenation is a fundamental step in minimizing the risk of hypoxemia, especially for patients undergoing procedures requiring sedation. The end-tidal oxygen concentration is a reliable marker for evaluating preoxygenation adequacy, 12 yet its routine application remains infrequent, leading to variable and often suboptimal outcomes. A promising alternative is the oxygen reserve index (ORi), a noninvasive parameter with significant potential for improving preoxygenation monitoring. 30 31 Unlike traditional pulse oximetry, which detects hypoxemia only after it occurs, ORi provides an early warning of desaturation, enabling timely and proactive interventions. Randomized controlled trials have demonstrated that high-flow nasal oxygenation results in higher ORi values than FM ventilation, confirming the reliability of ORi in assessing oxygenation status during anesthesia induction. 32 Integrating monitoring tools such as ORi into clinical practice could significantly enhance preoxygenation strategies, particularly in high-risk patients. Its ability to detect impending desaturation at an early stage represents a major advancement in patient safety, providing a more proactive and effective approach to managing oxygenation during sedation-based procedures. Moreover, ORi monitoring enhances the early detection of desaturation, improving patient management in critical scenarios. 33 34 Although our current protocol does not incorporate advanced monitoring technologies such as ORi, we acknowledge their potential to enhance preoxygenation strategies. Future studies should explore the integration of such tools to optimize preoxygenation and improve patient outcomes.\n\nWhile a variety of preoxygenation methods exist, identifying universally optimal practices remains challenging. 13 24 35 36 37 38 Our protocol, which is specifically tailored to the resources and patient demographics of our institution, represents a balanced and effective approach. However, we acknowledge that this protocol may not universally achieve adequate preoxygenation across all clinical settings. The deliberate design of our preoxygenation protocol integrates evidence-based practices to maximize the efficiency and safety of oxygenation. The use of a tightly fitted FM ensures the delivery of high-concentration oxygen, effectively avoiding dilution with ambient air and maintaining an elevated fraction of inspired oxygen levels. This method supports rapid nitrogen washout and effective lung oxygenation, which is especially critical in scenarios requiring prompt airway management. 39 Achieving positive end-expiratory pressure during preoxygenation is critical for effective ventilation and oxygenation. This is accomplished by closing the adjustable pressure-limiting valve on the ventilation device and ensuring a tight seal of the mask to prevent air leakage. Such leaks can significantly reduce the efficacy of preoxygenation. 40 41 High-flow oxygen plays a pivotal role in creating a mild positive pressure environment, reducing nasopharyngeal airway resistance, and enhancing alveolar recruitment. 42 43 44 This approach is particularly advantageous for patients with impaired respiratory function, optimizing oxygen delivery and improving clinical outcomes.\n\nTo enhance efficiency, we replaced the traditional 3-minute tidal volume breath with eight VCBs performed within 1 minute. This modification achieves comparable results in terms of nitrogen washout and oxygen loading while significantly reducing the time required for preoxygenation. 45 46 47 The shortened duration improves workflow and patient compliance, which is especially beneficial in time-sensitive clinical settings. This adaptation ensures that clinical effectiveness is maintained while meeting the demands of high-throughput environments.\n\nSupervision by an endoscopy nurse is a critical element of our protocol, ensuring rigorous adherence to guidelines, consistency across diverse patient populations, and real-time monitoring to address complications promptly. 48 49 The enhanced preoxygenation protocol in our study requires supervision by an endoscopy nurse, which may not be feasible in all clinical settings. While advanced techniques such as high-flow nasal oxygen therapy and ORi offer potential benefits, their high costs, complexity, and need for further validation limit their widespread adoption. 50 51 By prioritizing a balance between simplicity and effectiveness, our protocol is optimized for use in resource-limited settings and high-volume clinical environments, ensuring broad applicability without compromising quality.\n\nIn the subgroup analysis, the intervention exhibited more pronounced efficacy in mitigating hypoxemia within the elderly subgroup (age ≥ 60 years; OR = 0.13, 95% CI : 0.04–0.45, P = 0.001) and moderate efficacy in the obese subgroup (BMI ≥ 28 kg/m²; OR = 0.20, 95% CI : 0.04–1.07, P = 0.06). These findings suggest that the intervention is highly effective in reducing hypoxemia risk in elderly patients, despite their physiological decline characterized by reduced lung capacity and impaired oxygen uptake. For obese patients, the intervention also notably reduced hypoxemia risk, although the effect was less pronounced than that in the elderly group. These findings highlight the importance of considering tailored strategies for high-risk populations, potentially incorporating advanced monitoring technologies such as ORi to further enhance the intervention’s efficacy.\n\nOur study is not without limitations. While the nonblinded nature of our study was necessary due to the visible differences in preoxygenation methods, it is acknowledged that this could introduce observer bias. Future studies should consider implementing single-blinding or double-blinding where feasible or employing independent observers to minimize such biases. The single-center design of our study may limit the generalizability of our findings. This design, while allowing for detailed control and standardization within our specific setting, may not fully capture the variability in patient populations, clinical practices, and resource availability across different healthcare environments. To increase the external validity and broader clinical applicability of our results, we recommend that future studies adopt a multicenter approach. Such an approach would help to validate the effectiveness of the enhanced preoxygenation protocol across diverse settings and patient demographics, ensuring that the intervention is robust and applicable in various real-world scenarios. Additionally, the focus on gastrointestinal endoscopy patients may limit its applicability to other procedural contexts. Furthermore, variations in sedation depth, anesthesiologists’ techniques, and procedural durations were not fully accounted for, potentially influencing the occurrence of hypoxemia. 52 The absence of hemodynamic monitoring also represents a limitation, as it could have provided valuable insights into patient responses. 53 Future research should explore these gaps and assess the protocol’s effectiveness in longer and more complex procedures while considering advanced monitoring technologies such as high-flow nasal oxygen and ORi.\n\nIn conclusion, our findings demonstrate the importance of enhanced preoxygenation protocols in reducing hypoxemia during propofol sedation for gastrointestinal endoscopy, particularly in high-risk populations such as elderly individuals and individuals with elevated BMIs. The protocol’s simplicity, cost-effectiveness, and clinical efficiency make it a practical solution for a wide range of settings. Clinical supervision during preoxygenation remains a critical factor for ensuring adherence to the protocol and maintaining high-quality standards. While future advancements may refine these practices further, adopting accessible strategies such as ours is essential for improving patient safety and procedural outcomes in endoscopy.\n\nAdditional file:\n\nAdditional file 1 : CONSORT 2010 checklist .",
