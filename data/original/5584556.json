  "abstract": "Background: Mutations in KRAS and TP53 are common in colorectal carcinogenesis and are associated with resistance to therapy. Rectal cancers carrying both mutations are less likely to respond to neoadjuvant chemoradiation therapy (CRT) compared to wildtype tumors. Codon-specific KRAS mutations are associated with variable resistance to targeted therapies, but their association with rectal cancer response to CRT remains unclear. Our objective was to establish a correlation between specific KRAS mutations and rectal cancer response to CRT, and investigate if the correlation was related to a different association between KRAS and TP53 mutations.\n\nMethods: One hundred forty-eight stage II–III rectal cancer patients underwent pre-operative CRT followed by surgery. DNA was extracted from pretreatment tumor biopsies and paired normal surgical tissues and KRAS and TP53 genotyping was performed. Specific KRAS mutations were then correlated with tumor response, and with concurrent TP53 mutation.\n\nResults: Sixty patients had KRAS mutation; 12 in codon 13, and 48 in other locations. Eighty patients had TP53 mutation; 27 had concurrent KRAS / TP53 mutations. Tumors with any KRAS mutation were less likely to have a pCR compared to wildtype KRAS (p=0.006). Specifically, no tumors with KRAS codon 13 mutations had a pCR (p=0.03). Tumors with KRAS codon 13 mutations also had a higher incidence of concurrent TP53 mutation compared to tumors with other KRAS mutations (p=0.02).\n\nConclusions: Mutations in different KRAS codons may have different effects on rectal cancer resistance to CRT. This variable resistance may be related to a different frequency of TP53 mutations in KRAS mutant tumors.",
