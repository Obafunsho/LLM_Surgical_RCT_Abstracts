  "title": "Local-regional recurrence following neoadjuvant endocrine therapy: Data from ACOSOG Z1031 (Alliance), a randomized phase II neoadjuvant comparison between letrozole, anastrozole, and exemestane for postmenopausal women with estrogen receptor–positive clinical stage 2 to 3 breast cancer",
  "abstract": "Background:: ACOSOG Z1031 addressed the ability of three neoadjuvant aromatase inhibitors (NAIs) to reduce residual disease (Cohort A) and to assess whether switching to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NCT) after 4 weeks on NAI with Ki67 > 10% increases pathologic complete response (pCR) in postmenopausal women with estrogen receptor-enriched (Allred score 6–8) breast cancer (BC).\n\nMethods:: 622 women with clinical stage 2–3 estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) BC were enrolled, (Cohort A: 377, Cohort B: 245). The analysis cohort consisted of 509 patients after excluding patients who did not meet trial eligibility criteria, switched to NCT or surgery due to 4-week Ki67 > 10%, or withdrew prior to surgery. Distribution of time to local-regional recurrence (LRR) was estimated using competing risk approach where distant recurrence and second primaries were considered competing risk events. Patients who died without LRR, distant recurrence or second primary were censored at last evaluation.\n\nResults:: 342 (67.2%) patients had breast conserving surgery (BCS). Of 221 patients thought to require mastectomy at presentation, 50% were able to have BCS. Five (1.0%) patients had no residual disease in the breast or nodes at surgery. Among 382 women still alive, 90% have been followed >5 years. Five-year cumulative incidence rate for LRR is estimated to be 1.53% (95% CI: 0.7 to 3.0%).\n\nConclusions:: NAI rarely results in pCR in stage 2–3 ER+ BC, however a significant proportion will have downstaging to allow for BCS. LRR after surgery is uncommon (1.5% at 5 years) and support the use of BCS after NAI.",
