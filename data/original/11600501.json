  "title": "Prophylactic use of inotropic agents for the prevention of low cardiac output syndrome and mortality in adults undergoing cardiac surgery",
  "abstract": "Background: As the burden of cardiovascular disease grows, so does the number of cardiac surgeries. Surgery is increasingly performed on older people with comorbidities who are at higher risk of developing perioperative complications such as low cardiac output state (LCOS). Surgery‐associated LCOS represents a serious pathology responsible for substantial morbidity and mortality. Prevention of LCOS is a critical and worthwhile aim to further improve the outcome and effectiveness of cardiac surgery. However, guidelines consistently report a lack of evidence for pharmacological LCOS prophylaxis.\n\nObjectives: To assess the benefits and harms of the prophylactic use of any inotropic agent to prevent low cardiac output and associated morbidity and mortality in adults undergoing cardiac surgery.\n\nSearch methods: We identified trials (without language restrictions) via systematic searches of CENTRAL , MEDLINE, Embase, and CPCI‐S Web of Science in October 2022. We checked reference lists from primary studies and review articles for additional references. We also searched two registers of ongoing trials.\n\nSelection criteria: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) enrolling adults who underwent cardiac surgery and were prophylactically treated with one or multiple inotropic agent(s) in comparison to any type of control (i.e. standard cardiac care, placebo, other inotropic agents).\n\nData collection and analysis: We used established methodological procedures according to Cochrane standards. Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias according to a pre‐defined protocol. On request, we obtained a reply and additional information from only one of the included study authors. We used the five GRADE considerations (study limitations, consistency of effect, imprecision, indirectness, and publication bias) to assess the certainty of evidence from the studies that contributed data to the meta‐analyses for the pre‐specified outcomes. Based on the identified studies, there were seven comparison groups: amrinone versus placebo, dopamine versus placebo, milrinone versus placebo, levosimendan versus dobutamine, levosimendan versus milrinone, levosimendan versus standard cardiac care, and levosimendan versus placebo.\n\nMain results: We identified 29 eligible studies, including 3307 individuals, and four ongoing studies. In general, confidence in the results of the analysed studies was reduced due to relevant study limitations, imprecision, or inconsistency. Domains of concern encompassed inadequate methods of sequence generation and lack of blinding. The majority of trials were small, with only a few included participants, and investigated the prophylactic use of levosimendan. Our meta‐analyses showed that levosimendan as compared to placebo may reduce the risk of LCOS (risk ratio (RR) 0.43, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.25 to 0.74; I 2 = 66%; 1724 participants, 6 studies; GRADE: low) and probably reduces all‐cause mortality (RR 0.65, 95% CI 0.43 to 0.97; I 2 = 11%; 2347 participants, 14 studies; GRADE: moderate). This translates into a number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) of 8 to prevent one event of LCOS post surgery and of 44 to prevent one death at 30 days. Subgroup analyses revealed that the beneficial effects of levosimendan were predominantly observed in preoperative drug administration. Our meta‐analyses further indicated that levosimendan as compared to placebo may shorten the length of intensive care unit (ICU) stay (mean difference ‐1.00 days, 95% CI ‐1.63 to ‐0.37; 572 participants, 7 studies; GRADE: very low) and the duration of mechanical ventilation (mean difference ‐8.03 hours, 95% CI ‐13.17 to ‐2.90; 572 participants, 7 studies; GRADE: very low) but the evidence is very uncertain. The risk of adverse events did not clearly differ between levosimendan and placebo groups (cardiogenic shock: RR 0.65, 95% CI 0.40 to 1.05; I 2 = 0%; 1212 participants, 3 studies; GRADE: high; atrial fibrillation: RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.27; I 2 = 60%; 1934 participants, 11 studies; GRADE: very low; perioperative myocardial infarction: RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.61 to 1.31; I 2 = 13%; 1838 participants, 8 studies; GRADE: moderate; non‐embolic stroke or transient ischaemic attack: RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.58 to 1.38; I 2 = 0%; 1786 participants, 8 studies; GRADE: moderate). However, levosimendan as compared to placebo might reduce the number of participants requiring mechanical circulatory support (RR 0.47, 95% CI 0.24 to 0.91; I 2 = 74%; 1881 participants, 10 studies; GRADE: low). There was no conclusive evidence on the effect of levosimendan compared to standard cardiac care on LCOS (RR 0.49, 95% CI 0.14 to 1.73; I 2 = 59%; 208 participants, 3 studies; GRADE: very low), all‐cause mortality (RR 0.37, 95% CI 0.13 to 1.04; I 2 = 0%; 208 participants, 3 studies; GRADE: low), adverse events (cardiogenic shock: RR 0.62, 95% CI 0.22 to 1.81; 128 participants, 1 study; GRADE: very low; atrial fibrillation: RR 0.40, 95% CI 0.11 to 1.41; I 2 = 60%; 188 participants, 2 studies; GRADE: very low; perioperative myocardial infarction: RR 0.62, 95% CI 0.22 to 1.81; 128 participants, 1 study; GRADE: very low; non‐embolic stroke or transient ischaemic attack: RR 0.56, 95% CI 0.27 to 1.18; 128 participants, 1 study; GRADE: very low), length of ICU stay (mean difference 0.33 days, 95% CI ‐1.16 to 1.83; 80 participants, 2 studies; GRADE: very low), the duration of mechanical ventilation (mean difference ‐3.40 hours, 95% CI ‐11.50 to 4.70; 128 participants, 1 study; GRADE: very low), and the number of participants requiring mechanical circulatory support (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.50 to 1.55; I 2 = 0%; 208 participants, 3 studies; GRADE: low).\n\nAuthors' conclusions: Prophylactic treatment with levosimendan may reduce the incidence of LCOS and probably reduces associated mortality in adult patients undergoing cardiac surgery when compared to placebo only. Conclusions on the benefits and harms of other inotropic agents cannot be drawn due to limited study data. Given the limited evidence available, there is an unmet need for large‐scale, well‐designed randomised trials. Future studies of levosimendan ought to be designed to derive potential benefit in specific patient groups and surgery types, and the optimal administration protocol.",

  "full_text": "Summary of findings\n\nBackground\n\nDescription of the condition\n\nThe worldwide increasing number of individuals with cardiovascular disease results in a steadily rising number of patients undergoing heart surgery. Globally, more than 1.5 million individuals undergo heart surgery in about 4000 centres annually; the vast majority of surgeries are performed in high‐income countries ( Vervoort 2020 ).\n\nThe state of low cardiac output (LCOS) represents a potential complication of heart surgery, and is associated with a marked increase in morbidity and mortality. It is characterised mainly by a spontaneous drop of systolic cardiac function and a reduction of circulatory capacity, resulting in cardio‐circulatory insufficiency; perfusion of the microcirculation and oxygen supply of end organ tissue cannot be maintained. However, there is no standardised definition of LCOS. For the purpose of this review, we will consider the most widely used definition of cardio‐circulatory insufficiency (cardiac index (CI) < 2.2 L/min/m²; mean arterial pressure (MAP) < 60 mmHg; mixed venous oxygen saturation (SvO2) < 60 %) despite optimal therapy including euvolaemia within two hours after completion of the index procedure ( Pérez 2012 ). This haemodynamic state must be associated with clinical signs and symptoms of malperfusion, or end‐organ hypoperfusion (e.g. cumulating lactate levels > 2.0 mmol/L; cool extremities, oliguria or anuria, with a diuresis < 0.5 mL/kg/h; Pérez 2012 ). The state of LCOS can further destabilise into cardiogenic shock (CS), when systolic blood pressure (SBP) falls below 90 mmHg, or catecholamines are required for a duration of at least 15 minutes, or both ( Pérez 2012 ; van Diepen 2017 ). Following the adverse spiral of shock, subsequent peripheral malperfusion can culminate in multi‐organ dysfunction ( van Diepen 2017 ). LCOS related to cardiac surgery can have a variety of causes. Both worsening of pre‐existing heart disease and the adverse impact of cardiac surgery may contribute to the development of LCOS ( Carl 2010 ; Habicher 2018 ).\n\nDescription of the intervention\n\nTo maintain a physiological haemodynamic state during cardiac surgery can be challenging, and frequently requires pharmacological interventions or mechanical circulatory support. This might be even more challenging in light of the growing population of the elderly and people with multiple comorbidities who are currently undergoing heart surgery. The drugs predominantly used for haemodynamic stabilisation in LCOS are inotropes. Inotropes restore adequate perfusion by increasing systolic cardiac function.\n\nMore traditional inotropes, such as catecholamines (e.g. dopamine, epinephrine, norepinephrine, dobutamine, dopexamine) and phosphodiesterase (PDE)‐III‐inhibitors (e.g. milrinone, enoximone, amrinone), act by increasing the calcium influx of cardiomyocytes in different ways, thereby enhancing contractility ( Habicher 2018 ). To some degree, this comes with a risk of arrhythmias ( Carl 2010 ; Habicher 2018 ).\n\nAs an established alternative, myocardial contractility can also be increased by triggering myocardial coupling to a given calcium concentration. This can be addressed pharmacologically with calcium sensitisers ( Carl 2010 ; Habicher 2018 ). Out of the drug class of calcium sensitisers, the broadest body of evidence exists for levosimendan. Levosimendan acts by enhancing the responsiveness of myofilaments to calcium and, thereby, increasing cardiac output without elevating myocardial oxygen consumption ( Habicher 2018 ; Pathak 2013 ). Therefore, it is considered to be fairly safe and effective in the prevention or treatment of surgery‐related LCOS ( Carl 2010 ; Habicher 2018 ). Similarly to other inotropes, levosimendan is administered intravenously, with an option to start with a bolus prior to continuous infusion. For prophylactic use, levosimendan is applied before, during, or after the person is weaned from cardiopulmonary bypass. Since its active metabolite, OR‐1896, has a half‐life of 70 to 80 hours, it is thought that levosimendan provides prolonged haemodynamic benefit ( Pathak 2013 ). Levosimendan is a widely studied calcium sensitiser. In addition to many small‐scale studies, several randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and meta‐analyses generating heterogenous data have recently been published ( Chen 2017 ; Chen 2018 ; Cholley 2017 ; Conte 2019 ; Desai 2018 ; Elbadawi 2018 ; Landoni 2017 ; Lee 2017 ; Mehta 2017 ; Ng 2019 ; Putzu 2018 ; Qiang 2018 ; Sanfilippo 2017 ; Schumann 2018 ; Tena 2018 ; van Diepen 2020 ; Wang 2018 ; Wang 2019 ; Wang 2019a ; Weber 2020 ; Yan 2020 ; Zhou 2018 ; Zhu 2019 ).\n\nHow the intervention might work\n\nThe outcome of people undergoing cardiac surgery is critically dependent on minimising or avoiding functional or morphological cell damage of the myocardium which, in turn, would alter contractility. People are even more at risk for a negative haemodynamic cascade if left ventricular function was impaired beforehand ( Carl 2010 ; Habicher 2018 ). The main treatment strategies in LCOS aim to prevent or to improve impaired macro‐ and microcirculatory perfusion, in order to maintain oxygen supply at the cellular level and to modulate local and systemic inflammatory responses ( van Diepen 2017 ). These mechanistic leverages are intended to prevent or minimise secondary multi‐organ dysfunction, or failure.\n\nClassic inotropic agents (catecholamines, PDE‐III‐inhibitors) increase cardiac contractility and reduce systemic vascular resistance (SVR), thereby attenuating left ventricular afterload via activation of the cAMP pathway ( Habicher 2018 ). The resulting increase in myocardial performance and haemodynamic improvement is accompanied by intensified myocardial oxygen consumption, a relevant consequence of inotropic support ( Carl 2010 ; Habicher 2018 ). Therefore, if clinically required, the use of inotropes should be restricted to a limited duration.\n\nCalcium sensitisers have been extensively studied in an attempt to prevent LCOS. The effect of calcium sensitisers, such as levosimendan, is based on a dual mechanism. First, the pharmacological agent binds to troponin C, increasing the stability of the tropomyosin molecule ( Habicher 2018 ; Pathak 2013 ). This results in enhanced myocardial contractility. The presence of calcium is a prerequisite for the binding of levosimendan to troponin C. As levosimendan does not negatively affect unbound intracellular calcium levels, it does not influence the relaxation of the myocardium ( Habicher 2018 ; Pathak 2013 ). Second, levosimendan causes relaxation of smooth muscles by opening ATP‐sensitive potassium channels in the vasculature ( Habicher 2018 ; Pathak 2013 ). This facilitates coronary blood flow and myocardial perfusion. Similarly, levosimendan elicits vasodilatation of peripheral arteries which, in turn, reduces left ventricular afterload ( Habicher 2018 ; Pathak 2013 ). So, levosimendan exerts both inotropic and vasodilatory effects.\n\nThis review will focus on all inotropic agents that are being used to prophylactically minimise the incidence of LCOS in adults undergoing cardiac surgery.\n\nWhy it is important to do this review\n\nAs the burden of cardiovascular disease grows in western society, so does the number of cardiac surgeries. Due to medical progress and refinements of care at all healthcare levels, i.e. perioperative myocardial protection, specialised cardio‐anaesthesia, haemodynamic monitoring, surgical techniques, intraoperative perfusion, and postoperative management, the morbidity and mortality of people undergoing cardiovascular surgery have decreased overall. Against this background, surgical procedures are performed in increasingly elderly and comorbid people, who are already at a higher risk of developing perioperative complications, such as LCOS. LCOS represents a serious pathology that accounts for substantial morbidity and mortality following cardiac surgery. Beyond its prognostic impact, LCOS can increase the length of stay in the intensive care unit (ICU) and in the hospital overall. As a result of a complicated postoperative course, LCOS increases the use of medical resources (e.g. ventilators, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) circuits, dialysis) and ultimately increases medical costs. Hence, the prevention of LCOS is a critical and worthwhile aim to further improve the outcome and effectiveness of cardiac surgery.\n\nNotwithstanding the relevance described above, research on the prophylactic use of inotropic agents in cardiac surgery has not resulted in high‐quality evidence in support of the concept ( Elbadawi 2018 ; Ng 2019 ; Wang 2019a ). Based on heterogenous original data, national and international guidelines consistently state a lack of evidence for pharmacological treatment of LCOS, and do not recommend it ( Cholley 2017 ; Desai 2018 ; Mehta 2017 ; Wang 2019 ). This is especially true for its prophylactic use ( Carl 2010 ; Habicher 2018 ; Ponikowski 2016 ; Pérez 2012 ; van Diepen 2017 ). It remains uncertain whether people with specific disorders do better, or if certain surgical methods, drugs or administration protocols provide better outcomes.\n\nIn light of the growing number of people undergoing heart surgery, and the critical impact on clinical practice, this review will assess the efficacy and safety of a precautionary administration of inotropes, by analysing available randomised controlled trials. This review aims to generate a basis for evidence‐based decision‐making in future clinical practice, improving perioperative morbidity and mortality. The evaluation of current evidence and the identification of persistent knowledge gaps may contribute to the conception and design of future clinical trials.\n\nObjectives\n\nTo assess the benefits and harms of the prophylactic use of any inotropic agent to prevent low cardiac output and associated morbidity and mortality in adults undergoing cardiac surgery.\n\nMethods\n\nCriteria for considering studies for this review\n\nTypes of studies\n\nWe included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of parallel or multi‐arm design with randomisation at the level of the participant, regardless of the study publication status. We excluded studies that aimed to evaluate interventions but did not use randomisation for participant allocation to different study arms (quasi‐randomised trials), due to concerns regarding internal validity, as well as cross‐over trials, due to the investigation of all‐cause mortality as the primary outcome. We excluded RCTs whose unit of allocation was not the individual participant (cluster‐RCTs), due to our interest in the individual effect of an intervention.\n\nTypes of participants\n\nWe included RCTs that investigated the prophylactic administration of inotropic agents, enrolling adults (≥ 18 years of age) undergoing cardiac surgery, without signs of low cardiac output (LCOS) at the time of inclusion, with a follow‐up period spanning at least the hospitalisation phase. We considered any type of cardiac surgery, with the exception of complex heart defects, which require several operations in succession. We considered procedures with and without cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). Participants were included regardless of clinical heart failure state or pre‐existing left ventricular (LV) dysfunction. We assessed the aspects of 'type of cardiac surgery' and 'pre‐existing LV dysfunction' by subgroup analyses. Studies including only a subset of relevant participants were also considered.\n\nTypes of interventions\n\nWe included trials investigating the use of inotropic agents (i.e. dopamine, epinephrine, norepinephrine, dobutamine, dopexamine, milrinone, enoximone, amrinone, levosimendan), either alone or in combination, started for preventive reasons before, during, or after the surgical intervention. There were no restrictions in terms of delivery or dosage. We considered the comparison of (i) inotropic agent(s) to treatments without specific experimental single drugs (standard cardiac care), or (ii) inotropic agent(s) to placebo or (iii) inotropic agents(s) to other inotropic agent(s).\n\nTypes of outcome measures\n\nReporting in the trial of one or more of the outcomes listed here was not an inclusion criterion for the review. When a published report did not appear to report one of these outcomes, we accessed the trial protocol and contacted the trial authors to ascertain whether the outcomes were measured but not reported. We used quantitative data provided by the study authors. We included relevant trials, which measured these outcomes but did not report the data at all or not in a usable format, as part of the narrative in the review.\n\nGiven the clinical relevance of LCOS during the acute perioperative and immediate postoperative period, we focused on the short‐term course (intensive care unit (ICU) and hospital stay). We also examined data at the longest follow‐up given in each study.\n\nPrimary outcomes\n\nAll‐cause mortality (within 30 days) Incidence of LCOS, as defined in the background section (perioperatively until 48 hours after the completion of the procedure) Adverse events (number or proportion of participants) Cardiogenic shock (mean arterial pressure (MAP) < 60 mmHg or requirement of catecholamines for more than 15 minutes; cardiac index (CI) < 2.2 L/min/m²; pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) > 18 mmHg; lactate level > 2.0 mmol/L; venous oxygen saturation (SvO2) < 60%; clinical signs of malperfusion) Arrhythmia (atrial fibrillation, supraventricular tachycardia, ventricular arrhythmia of new onset) Perioperative myocardial infarction (increasing troponin and creatine kinase‐MB (CK‐MB) levels of more than 50% relative to baseline; electrocardiogram (ECG) changes, or regional wall motion abnormalities, or angiographic changes, or a combination) Non‐embolic stroke or transient ischaemic attack\n\nSecondary outcomes\n\nLength of hospital stay (days) Length of intensive care unit (ICU) stay (days) CI (L/min/m²) in ICU MAP pressure (mmHg) in ICU PCWP (mmHg) in ICU Duration of mechanical ventilation (hours) Proportion of weaning failure within 48 hours of extubation (objective (e.g. tachypnoea, hypertension, hypoxaemia, acidosis) or subjective (e.g. agitation, distress, diaphoresis, increased respiratory efforts), or both), signs of respiratory insufficiency; unsuccessful permanent discontinuation of mechanical ventilation Number of participants requiring mechanical circulatory support Number of participants requiring additional inotropic drugs Number of participants requiring cardiac transplantation or ventricular assist device implantation of any bridging strategy Number of participants requiring cardiopulmonary resuscitation Proportion of renal failure (increase of serum creatinine of at least 0.3 mg/dL, oliguria or anuria with diuresis < 0.5 mL/kg/h for at least six hours, or requirement of renal replacement therapy, or a combination)\n\nWe included any data on participants' quality of life or medical cost in the analysed studies as part of the narrative in the review.\n\nSearch methods for identification of studies\n\nElectronic searches\n\nWe identified trials through systematic searches of the following bibliographic databases on 17 October 2022:\n\nCochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2022, Issue 10) in the Cochrane Library; MEDLINE All (Ovid, 1946 to 14 October 2022); Embase (Ovid, 1980 to 2022 week 41); Conference Proceedings Citation Index ‐ Science (CPCI‐S) on the Web of Science (Clarivate Analytics, 1990 to 17 October 2022).\n\nWe adapted the search strategy for MEDLINE Ovid for use in the other databases ( Appendix 1 ). We applied the Cochrane sensitivity and precision‐maximising RCT filter to MEDLINE Ovid, and adapted it to the other databases, except CENTRAL ( Lefebvre 2019 ).\n\nWe also conducted a search of ClinicalTrials.gov ( www.ClinicalTrials.gov ) and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) Search Portal ( apps.who.int/trialsearch/ ) for ongoing or unpublished trials on 17 October 2022.\n\nWe searched all databases from their inception to the present, with no restriction on language or status of publication.\n\nSearching other resources\n\nWe checked the reference lists of all included studies and relevant systematic reviews identified for additional references of interest. We also examined any relevant retraction statements and errata for included studies.\n\nData collection and analysis\n\nSelection of studies\n\nTwo review authors (DG and JS) independently screened titles and abstracts of all the potential studies we identified in our search, and coded them as 'retrieve' (eligible, potentially eligible, or unclear) or 'do not retrieve'. Disagreements were resolved by consensus. We retrieved the full‐text study reports or publication, and two review authors (DG and JS) independently screened the full text, identified studies for inclusion, and identified and recorded reasons for excluding the ineligible studies. Any disagreement was resolved by discussion. We identified and excluded duplicates and collated multiple reports of the same study, so that each study was the unit of interest in the review process. We recorded the selection process in sufficient detail to complete a PRISMA flow diagram ( Figure 1 ) and 'Characteristics of excluded studies' table ( Liberati 2009 ).\n\nData extraction and management\n\nWe used a data collection form for study characteristics and outcome data, which had been piloted on at least one study in the review process. Two review authors (DG and JS) extracted study characteristics from the included studies. We extracted the following study characteristics.\n\nMethods: study design, total duration of enrolment and follow‐up, number and location of study centres, study setting, and period of study. Participants: N randomised, N lost to follow‐up or withdrawn, N analysed, mean age, age range, gender, participant with or without pre‐existing LV dysfunction, type of cardiac surgery, inclusion criteria, and exclusion criteria. Interventions: intervention, comparison, concomitant medications, excluded medications, timing of the administration, and in the case of levosimendan, the administration protocol (with or without bolus). Outcomes: primary and secondary outcomes specified and collected, and time points reported. Notes: funding for the trial and notable conflicts of interest of trial authors.\n\nTwo review authors (DG and JS) independently extracted outcome data from the included studies. Disagreements were resolved by consensus. One review author (JS) transferred data into the Review Manager 5 file ( Review Manager 2020 ). We double‐checked whether data were entered correctly by comparing the data presented in the review with the data extraction form. A second review author (DG) spot‐checked study characteristics for accuracy in comparison to the trial reports.\n\nNo transformations of reported data were made before presentation in the review article and no numerical data were extracted from graphs.\n\nAssessment of risk of bias in included studies\n\nTwo review authors (DG and JS) independently assessed risk of bias for each study using Cochrane RoB 1, as outlined in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions ( Higgins 2011 ). Disagreements were resolved by consensus. We assessed the risk of bias in trial results according to the following domains:\n\nrandom sequence generation; allocation concealment; blinding of participants, personnel, and outcome assessment; incomplete outcome data; selective reporting; other sources of bias (cross‐over design, baseline differences, conduct of the study affected by interim results, deviation from the study protocol not reflecting clinical practice, inappropriate administration of an intervention, contra‐active or similar pre‐randomisation intervention).\n\nWe assessed the risk of bias for the outcomes of the included studies that are included in our summary of findings tables. The effect of interest was that of assignment to intervention, and assessment for risk of bias was the result corresponding to a full intention‐to‐treat (ITT) analysis.\n\nWe rated each domain as low, unclear, or high risk of bias. We summarised the risk of bias judgements across different studies for each of the domains listed, and for each outcome. The overall risk of bias is the least favourable assessment across the domains of bias.\n\nWhen considering treatment effects, we took the risk of bias for the contributing outcome data into account.\n\nMeasures of treatment effect\n\nWe analysed dichotomous data as risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI), and continuous data as mean difference (MD) with 95% CIs. We entered data presented as a scale with a consistent direction of effect.\n\nWe narratively described skewed data reported as medians and interquartile ranges.\n\nUnit of analysis issues\n\nWe included RCTs with a parallel design, as well as multi‐arm studies. For outcomes measured at multiple time points, we performed separate analyses, with time frames that reflected short‐term and longest follow‐up. In the case where a study contributed multiple, correlated comparisons, we combined groups to create a single pair‐wise comparison as outlined in the Cochrane Handbook ( Higgins 2019 ). We analysed groups in an appropriate way, which avoided arbitrary omission or double counting of participants.\n\nDealing with missing data\n\nWe contacted investigators or study sponsors to verify key study characteristics, and obtain missing numerical outcome data, when possible (e.g. when a study was identified as an abstract only). Wherever possible, we used the Review Manager 5 calculator to calculate missing standard deviations (SD), using other data from the trial, such as confidence intervals, based on methods outlined in the Cochrane Handbook ( Higgins 2019 ) . Whenever this was not possible, and we thought missing data may introduce serious bias, we explored the impact of including such studies in the overall assessment of results with a sensitivity analysis.\n\nAssessment of heterogeneity\n\nWe inspected forest plots visually to consider the direction and magnitude of effects and the degree of overlap between confidence intervals. We used the I² statistic to measure heterogeneity among the trials in each analysis, but acknowledge that there is substantial uncertainty in the value of I² if there are only a small number of studies available. We also considered the P value from the Chi² test. If we identified substantial heterogeneity (I² ≥ 50%), or we suspected heterogeneity from the confidence intervals in the forest plots, we reported it, and explored possible causes by prespecified subgroup analyses.\n\nAssessment of reporting biases\n\nIf we were able to pool more than 10 trials, we created and examined a funnel plot, to explore possible small study biases for the primary outcomes ( Sterne 2011 ). To assess asymmetry, we performed the Habord test, as implemented in the statistical software Stata 15 ( Stata ).\n\nData synthesis\n\nWe performed a meta‐analysis only where it was meaningful, i.e. if treatments, participants, and the underlying clinical question were similar enough for pooling to make sense.\n\nIn the primary analysis, we included all studies. We assessed the potential effects of studies at high risk, or unclear risk of bias in sensitivity analyses.\n\nWe used a random‐effects model, because we expected clinical heterogeneity to arise from differences in study characteristics, and the associated assumption that the effects being estimated in the different studies are not identical, but follow a similar distribution.\n\nSubgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity\n\nWe carried out the following subgroup analyses for any outcomes with substantial heterogeneity.\n\nRegimen of the control group (placebo‐controlled versus active control). Timing of the administration (preoperative versus perioperative versus postoperative). Administration protocol for levosimendan (with versus without bolus). Type of cardiac surgery (single versus combined structural procedures, procedures with versus without bypass). Participants with versus without pre‐existing LV dysfunction, i.e. heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF; LVEF > 50%), heart failure with mid‐range ejection fraction (HFmEF; LVEF 41% to 49%), and heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF; LVEF < 40%).\n\nWe used the formal test for subgroup differences in Review Manager 5, and based our interpretation on this.\n\nSensitivity analysis\n\nDepending on the number of included studies, we planned to carry out the following sensitivity analyses, to test whether key methodological factors or decisions had affected the main result.\n\nPrimary analyses including all studies and sensitivity analysis including only studies judged to be at an overall low risk of bias. Primary analysis using the random‐effects model, due to expected heterogeneity between studies; we also explored a fixed‐effect model if the I² statistic value was < 50%.\n\nSummary of findings and assessment of the certainty of the evidence\n\nWe created summary of findings tables using the following outcomes:\n\nAll‐cause mortality Incidence of LCOS Adverse events Length of ICU stay Duration of mechanical ventilation Number of participants requiring mechanical circulatory support\n\nIn clinical practice, the debate on prophylactic medication mainly relates to the use of the calcium sensitiser levosimendan. Most RCTs on this topic therefore focus on the efficacy and safety of this specific drug. For this reason, the summary of findings tables were restricted to the comparisons of levosimendan with placebo or standard care.\n\nTwo review authors (DG and JS) independently judged the certainty of the evidence, with disagreements resolved by discussion. We justified judgements by documenting decisions and incorporating them into the results for each outcome. We used the five GRADE considerations (study limitations, consistency of effect, imprecision, indirectness, and publication bias) to assess the certainty of the body of evidence as it relates to the studies that contribute data to the meta‐analyses for the prespecified outcomes. We used the overall risk of bias judgement for the GRADE assessment, as described in Chapter 14 of the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions ( Schünemann 2019 ). We justified all decisions to downgrade the certainty of studies using footnotes, and we made comments to aid the reader's understanding of the review, where necessary.\n\nResults\n\nDescription of studies\n\nRandomised controlled trials (RCTs) in individuals undergoing cardiac surgery and treated prophylactically with inotropic drugs.\n\nResults of the search\n\nAfter removing duplicates, we identified a total of 6416 references. By screening the titles and abstracts, we ascertained 49 references of potential relevance, whose full texts we assessed by applying our inclusion and exclusion criteria. This resulted in the inclusion of 29 studies (see Characteristics of included studies ). Furthermore, we identified four ongoing studies (see Characteristics of ongoing studies ). Details of the remaining studies can be found in Characteristics of excluded studies . The overall process is recorded in the PRISMA flowchart ( Figure 1 ).\n\nIncluded studies\n\nThe inclusion criteria were met by 29 randomised controlled studies. Each study characteristic is presented briefly in the table Characteristics of included studies . The qualitative and quantitative analysis of the included studies is based on published information. Contacting the authors of the included studies resulted in feedback and additional information only from the corresponding author of the study Baysal 2014 , which was included in the analysis.\n\nStudy size and location\n\nTwenty‐four studies were conducted as single‐centre trials in Belgium ( De Hert 2007 ), China ( Hu 2020 ), Denmark ( Juhl‐Olsen 2015 ), Egypt ( Amin 2019 ), Finland ( Jävelä 2008 ; Lahtinen 2011 ; Leppikangas 2011 ), Germany ( Erb 2014 ), Greece ( Anastasiadis 2016 ), India ( Desai 2018 ; Gandham 2013 ; Kandasamy 2017 ; Kodalli 2013 ; Mishra 2016 ; Shah 2014 ; Sharma 2014 ), Iran ( Hadadzadeh 2013 ), Israel ( Gatot 2004 ), Italy ( Tritapepe 2006 ; Tritapepe 2009 ), Japan ( Kikura 2002 ), Korea ( Jo 2010 ), or Turkey ( Baysal 2014 ; Ersoy 2013 ). In these studies, the number of enrolled study participants varied from 20 to 207.\n\nFive studies were conducted as multicentre trials in Canada (125 participants enrolled; Denault 2016 ), Finland (60 participants enrolled; Eriksson 2009 ), France (336 participants enrolled; Cholley 2017 ), the USA (252 participants enrolled; Levin 2012 ), or the USA plus Canada (882 participants enrolled; Mehta 2017 ).\n\nExamined surgical interventions\n\nThe types of surgery assessed included coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), off‐pump coronary artery bypass graft (OPCABG), and valve surgery. In one study, there was no detailed description of the cardiac surgery performed ( De Hert 2007 ). Only CABG ( Anastasiadis 2016 ; Eriksson 2009 ; Gatot 2004 ; Kikura 2002 ; Levin 2012 ; Tritapepe 2006 ; Tritapepe 2009 ) and OPCABG ( Amin 2019 ; Desai 2018 ; Hadadzadeh 2013 ; Jo 2010 ; Kandasamy 2017 ; Kodalli 2013 ; Shah 2014 ) participants were included in seven studies each; five trials were limited to participants with valve surgery ( Baysal 2014 ; Ersoy 2013 ; Gandham 2013 ; Juhl‐Olsen 2015 ; Mishra 2016 ). In one study, both patients with CABG and patients with valve surgery were included ( Hu 2020 ). Also, eight studies included participants with combined procedures, i.e. CABG with valve surgery or valve surgery with CABG ( Cholley 2017 ; Denault 2016 ; Erb 2014 ; Jävelä 2008 ; Lahtinen 2011 ; Leppikangas 2011 ; Mehta 2017 ; Sharma 2014 ).\n\nEmergency surgery was an exclusion criterion in 13 studies ( Anastasiadis 2016 ; Baysal 2014 ; Cholley 2017 ; Denault 2016 ; Desai 2018 ; Hadadzadeh 2013 ; Jo 2010 ; Kandasamy 2017 ; Kikura 2002 ; Levin 2012 ; Mishra 2016 ; Shah 2014 ; Sharma 2014 ). A total of 12 studies excluded participants with a history of heart surgery ( Anastasiadis 2016 ; Baysal 2014 ; Desai 2018 ; Eriksson 2009 ; Gandham 2013 ; Gatot 2004 ; Kandasamy 2017 ; Kodalli 2013 ; Shah 2014 ; Sharma 2014 ; Tritapepe 2006 ; Tritapepe 2009 ).\n\nExamined prophylactic medication\n\nThe majority of trials investigated the prophylactic usage of levosimendan compared to placebo ( Anastasiadis 2016 ; Cholley 2017 ; Erb 2014 ; Eriksson 2009 ; Hu 2020 ; Jävelä 2008 ; Juhl‐Olsen 2015 ; Kodalli 2013 ; Lahtinen 2011 ; Leppikangas 2011 ; Levin 2012 ; Mehta 2017 ; Shah 2014 ; Sharma 2014 ; Tritapepe 2006 ; Tritapepe 2009 ), standard cardiac care ( Baysal 2014 ; Desai 2018 ; Ersoy 2013 ), or another inotropic agent (either milrinone ( Amin 2019 ; De Hert 2007 ; Mishra 2016 ) or dobutamine ( Gandham 2013 ; Kandasamy 2017 )). Altogether, 2290 participants were enrolled in the studies on levosimendan compared to placebo, 208 participants in the studies on levosimendan compared to standard cardiac care, 100 participants in the studies on levosimendan compared to milrinone, and 140 participants in the studies on levosimendan compared to dobutamine. There were only four trials investigating milrinone versus placebo ( Denault 2016 ; Hadadzadeh 2013 ; Jo 2010 ; Kikura 2002 ), one trial investigating dopamine versus placebo ( Gatot 2004 ), and one trial investigating amrinone versus milrinone or placebo ( Kikura 2002 ). The number of enrolled participants was 275 for the comparison of milrinone versus placebo, 89 for the comparison of dopamine versus placebo, and 45 for the comparison of amrinone versus milrinone or placebo.\n\nLevosimendan was administered as a continuous infusion without loading dose in 15 studies ( Amin 2019 ; Anastasiadis 2016 ; Cholley 2017 ; De Hert 2007 ; Desai 2018 ; Erb 2014 ; Gandham 2013 ; Hu 2020 ; Jävelä 2008 ; Juhl‐Olsen 2015 ; Kandasamy 2017 ; Kodalli 2013 ; Mehta 2017 ; Shah 2014 ; Sharma 2014 ). In seven studies, the continuous administration was preceded by a bolus ( Baysal 2014 ; Eriksson 2009 ; Ersoy 2013 ; Lahtinen 2011 ; Leppikangas 2011 ; Levin 2012 ; Mishra 2016 ). In two studies, levosimendan was administered by bolus only ( Tritapepe 2006 ; Tritapepe 2009 ). The majority of studies used a dose of 0.1 µg/kg/min for continuous administration ( Amin 2019 ; Anastasiadis 2016 ; Baysal 2014 ; Cholley 2017 ; De Hert 2007 ; Desai 2018 ; Erb 2014 ; Ersoy 2013 ; Gandham 2013 ; Juhl‐Olsen 2015 ; Kandasamy 2017 ; Kodalli 2013 ; Levin 2012 ; Mishra 2016 ). In four studies, a dose of 0.1 to 0.2 µg/kg/min was used ( Hu 2020 ; Mehta 2017 ; Shah 2014 ; Sharma 2014 ) and in another four studies a dose of 0.2 µg/kg/min was administered ( Eriksson 2009 ; Jävelä 2008 ; Lahtinen 2011 ; Leppikangas 2011 ).\n\nIn 15 studies, continuous levosimendan administration was maintained for 24 hours. In Amin 2019 and Juhl‐Olsen 2015 , the administration was limited to the entire duration of surgery and in Gandham 2013 for the duration of weaning. Erb 2014 and Hu 2020 limited the administration to a total dose of 12.5 µg. In De Hert 2007 and Kodalli 2013 , levosimendan administration ended in the ICU according to the physician's decision to wean from inotropics.\n\nDifferences were also seen in the timing of levosimendan administration. In seven studies, levosimendan was administered preoperatively (on the day before surgery ( Leppikangas 2011 ), 24 hours before surgery ( Anastasiadis 2016 ; Levin 2012 ; Shah 2014 ; Sharma 2014 ), 12 hours before surgery ( Desai 2018 ), or 4 hours before surgery ( Juhl‐Olsen 2015 )). In 12 studies, administration occurred at the start of surgery, i.e. with induction of anaesthesia ( Amin 2019 ; Cholley 2017 ; Erb 2014 ; Eriksson 2009 ; Ersoy 2013 ; Jävelä 2008 ; Kandasamy 2017 ; Kodalli 2013 ; Lahtinen 2011 ), before skin incision ( Mehta 2017 ), or before cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) ( Tritapepe 2006 ; Tritapepe 2009 ). In four studies, levosimendan administration started at weaning from CPB ( Baysal 2014 ; De Hert 2007 ; Gandham 2013 ; Mishra 2016 ). In one study, levosimendan was administered only after the surgical procedure ( Hu 2020 ).\n\nThe studies investigating milrinone were also characterised by a wide variety of timing, dosage, duration, and route of drug administration. Denault 2016 used a single dose as an inhalant at the time of induction of anaesthesia. Jo 2010 administered milrinone perioperatively at a dose of 0.5 µg/kg/min. Kikura 2002 initiated milrinone at weaning from CPB and continued for 10 hours. Hadadzadeh 2013 started milrinone for a period of 24 hours after completion of the surgical procedure. Both Kikura 2002 and Hadadzadeh 2013 initially gave a bolus of 50 µg/kg followed by a continuous dose of 0.5 µg/kg/min.\n\nParticipants\n\nThe mean age varied between 52.5 and 76 years, with the exception of three studies that were characterised by a more juvenile age structure ( Ersoy 2013 ; Gandham 2013 ; Mishra 2016 ). In six studies, inclusion was restricted to adult patients (at least 18 years) ( Cholley 2017 ; Denault 2016 ; Erb 2014 ; Lahtinen 2011 ; Mehta 2017 ; Tritapepe 2009 ). Other age restrictions described were: 25 to 70 years ( Hu 2020 ), 30 to 65 years ( Kandasamy 2017 ), 35 to 75 years ( Desai 2018 ), 40 to 70 years ( Amin 2019 ), < 60 years ( Gandham 2013 ), and < 80 years ( Anastasiadis 2016 ). No age restriction was documented in the remaining 17 studies.\n\nThe proportion of male participants ranged from 40% ( Ersoy 2013 ) to 93.75% ( Anastasiadis 2016 ) between studies.\n\nA total of 17 studies focused on the examination of patients with left ventricular (LV) dysfunction ( Amin 2019 ; Anastasiadis 2016 ; Baysal 2014 ; Cholley 2017 ; De Hert 2007 ; Desai 2018 ; Erb 2014 ; Eriksson 2009 ; Ersoy 2013 ; Hadadzadeh 2013 ; Hu 2020 ; Kandasamy 2017 ; Levin 2012 ; Mehta 2017 ; Mishra 2016 ; Shah 2014 ; Sharma 2014 ). In contrast, five studies exclusively included participants without LV dysfunction ( Gandham 2013 ; Jävelä 2008 ; Juhl‐Olsen 2015 ; Kikura 2002 ; Kodalli 2013 ). In seven studies, both participants with and without LV dysfunction were enrolled ( Denault 2016 ; Gatot 2004 ; Jo 2010 ; Lahtinen 2011 ; Leppikangas 2011 ; Tritapepe 2006 ; Tritapepe 2009 ).\n\nFunding by pharmaceutical industry\n\nTrials that acknowledged funding by the pharmaceutical industry were: Anastasiadis 2016 (supported by Orion Pharma), Cholley 2017 (supported by Orion Pharma), Eriksson 2009 (supported by Orion Pharma), Juhl‐Olsen 2015 (supported by Orion Pharma; author associated with BK medical and GE Healthcare), Lahtinen 2011 (supported by and authors associated with Orion Pharma), Leppikangas 2011 (supported by and authors associated with Orion Pharma), Mehta 2017 (supported by Tenax Therapeutics; authors associated with Orion Pharma and Tenax Therapeutics), and Tritapepe 2006 ; Tritapepe 2009 (authors associated with Orion Pharma and Abbott). No information was given by Baysal 2014 , De Hert 2007 , Ersoy 2013 , Gatot 2004 , Hadadzadeh 2013 , Hu 2020 , Jävelä 2008 , Jo 2010 , Levin 2012 , or Mishra 2016 .\n\nExcluded studies\n\nWe excluded 20 trials for at least one of the following reasons: limited to perioperative evaluation, treatment not prophylaxis of LCOS, no randomisation, no assessment of LCOS, goal‐directed dosing of study drugs, exclusion of participants with postoperative LCOS, inclusion of participants with complex heart defects, cross‐over design, post hoc analysis of an included study. Details for each study can be found in the table Characteristics of excluded studies .\n\nRisk of bias in included studies\n\nA summary of all investigated sources of bias in the 29 eligible studies is presented in Figure 2 and Figure 3 . The risk of bias tables for the individual trials are given in Characteristics of included studies .\n\nAll included studies used intention‐to‐treat analysis and were published in peer‐reviewed journals. The studies were small, with the exception of Mehta 2017 , which enrolled 882 participants. Due to the small number of participants included (high imprecision of results), the evidence is considered limited. Other issues identified in the risk of bias review include inappropriate sequencing methods (selection bias) and lack of blinding (performance and detection bias). Funding from the pharmaceutical industry was acknowledged or conflicts of interest were not disclosed in 19 of the 29 studies.\n\nAllocation\n\nWe rated the risk of bias for random sequence generation as well as allocation concealment as low for 14 studies ( Cholley 2017 ; De Hert 2007 ; Denault 2016 ; Erb 2014 ; Eriksson 2009 ; Gandham 2013 ; Jävelä 2008 ; Juhl‐Olsen 2015 ; Kandasamy 2017 ; Lahtinen 2011 ; Mehta 2017 ; Mishra 2016 ; Tritapepe 2006 ; Tritapepe 2009 ). For Anastasiadis 2016 , Desai 2018 , and Hu 2020 , we also assessed the risk of random sequence generation to be low, but there was no information regarding allocation concealment. For Gatot 2004 , Hadadzadeh 2013 , Kikura 2002 , and Leppikangas 2011 , we rated the risk of allocation concealment as low, but no information was available regarding random sequence generation. We judged a high risk of bias for random sequence generation in five studies, with a low risk of bias for allocation concealment in Baysal 2014 , Levin 2012 , Shah 2014 , and Sharma 2014 , whereas no information regarding allocation concealment was available for Ersoy 2013 . Entirely no information regarding allocation was given in Amin 2019 , Jo 2010 , or Kodalli 2013 .\n\nBlinding\n\nWe rated the risk of bias for blinding of participants and personnel (performance bias), as well as blinding of outcome assessment (detection bias), as low for 22 studies ( Anastasiadis 2016 ; Cholley 2017 ; Denault 2016 ; Erb 2014 ; Eriksson 2009 ; Gandham 2013 ; Gatot 2004 ; Hadadzadeh 2013 ; Jävelä 2008 ; Jo 2010 ; Juhl‐Olsen 2015 ; Kandasamy 2017 ; Kikura 2002 ; Kodalli 2013 ; Lahtinen 2011 ; Leppikangas 2011 ; Levin 2012 ; Mehta 2017 ; Shah 2014 ; Sharma 2014 ; Tritapepe 2006 ; Tritapepe 2009 ). We judged a high risk of performance bias due to missing blinding of caregivers, yet low detection bias, for Baysal 2014 , De Hert 2007 , and Mishra 2016 . In three studies, blinding was not possible due to different administration of the study drugs ( Desai 2018 ; Ersoy 2013 ; Hu 2020 ). No information regarding blinding was given in Amin 2019 .\n\nIncomplete outcome data\n\nWe rated the risk of bias for incomplete outcome data as low for all studies.\n\nSelective reporting\n\nWe rated the risk of bias for selective reporting as low for 12 studies ( Anastasiadis 2016 ; Baysal 2014 ; Cholley 2017 ; Denault 2016 ; Erb 2014 ; Eriksson 2009 ; Gandham 2013 ; Juhl‐Olsen 2015 ; Lahtinen 2011 ; Levin 2012 ; Mehta 2017 ; Tritapepe 2009 ). In De Hert 2007 , prespecified secondary endpoints were missing, and neither primary nor secondary endpoints were defined in the remaining studies. However, in these studies, the measures listed in the methods section were reported in full.\n\nOther potential sources of bias\n\nWe rated the risk of bias for other potential sources of bias as low for 18 studies ( Anastasiadis 2016 ; Cholley 2017 ; De Hert 2007 ; Desai 2018 ; Erb 2014 ; Eriksson 2009 ; Gandham 2013 ; Gatot 2004 ; Hu 2020 ; Jävelä 2008 ; Jo 2010 ; Kandasamy 2017 ; Kikura 2002 ; Lahtinen 2011 ; Levin 2012 ; Mehta 2017 ; Tritapepe 2006 ; Tritapepe 2009 ) and unclear for 10 studies due to baseline differences in gender ( Amin 2019 ; Baysal 2014 ; Denault 2016 ; Ersoy 2013 ; Hadadzadeh 2013 ; Juhl‐Olsen 2015 ; Kodalli 2013 ; Leppikangas 2011 ; Sharma 2014 ) or baseline differences in age and missing information on gender ( Mishra 2016 ). Although the title and inclusion criteria of the study Shah 2014 implied that the enrolled participants underwent OPCABG, surgery was completed with the help of CPB for 1 of 25 participants from the intervention group and 8 of 25 participants from the comparison group.\n\nNone of the included trials reported any cross‐over or were affected by interim results.\n\nEffects of interventions\n\nSee: Table 1 ; Table 2\n\nAmrinone versus placebo\n\nThere was only one single‐centre study with 30 participants investigating amrinone compared to placebo ( Kikura 2002 ). All that the authors reported were haemodynamic parameters and the need for additional inotropics.\n\nPrimary outcomes\n\nAll‐cause mortality (within 30 days)\n\nThis outcome was not reported in the included study.\n\nIncidence of LCOS\n\nThis outcome was not reported in the included study.\n\nAdverse events\n\nThis outcome was not reported in the included study.\n\nSecondary outcomes\n\nLength of in‐hospital and intensive care unit stay\n\nThese outcomes were not reported in the included study.\n\nHaemodynamics (cardiac index, MAP, PCWP)\n\nCardiac index was increased in the amrinone‐treated group compared to the placebo group during this period (2.5 ± 0.2 versus 1.9 ± 0.5 l/min/m 2 ) ( Analysis 1.1 ). With regard to MAP, the study authors reportedly observed no differences between the study groups (observation period: 7 to 10 hours after CPB; no quantitative data available). Information on PCWP was not reported.\n\nDuration of mechanical ventilation\n\nThis outcome was not reported in the included study.\n\nProportion of weaning failure within 48 hours of extubation\n\nThis outcome was not reported in the included study.\n\nNumber of patients requiring mechanical circulatory support (IABP)\n\nThis outcome was not reported in the included study.\n\nNumber of patients requiring additional inotropic drugs\n\nDopamine was administered when needed. The authors claimed that the mean total dose of dopamine administered in the first 24 hours after surgery was lower in the amrinone group than in the placebo group. This was said to be due to a slower rate of dopamine infusion in the period 7 to 10 hours after CPB. Quantitative data were not available. No information was given on the number of patients who received additional dopamine.\n\nNumber of patients requiring cardiac transplantation, ventricular assist device (VAD) implantation or cardiopulmonary resuscitation\n\nThese outcomes were not reported in the included study.\n\nProportion of renal failure\n\nThis outcome was not reported in the included study.\n\nQuality of life\n\nThis outcome was not reported in the included study.\n\nDopamine versus placebo\n\nThere was only one single‐centre study with 81 participants investigating dopamine compared to placebo ( Gatot 2004 ).\n\nPrimary outcomes\n\nAll‐cause mortality (within 30 days)\n\nThis outcome was not reported in the included study.\n\nIncidence of LCOS\n\nNo RR and resulting estimations of absolute effect were possible since no events were observed in either group ( Analysis 2.1 ).\n\nAdverse events\n\nInformation on cardiogenic shock or non‐embolic stroke/transient ischaemic attack was not reported. There was no evidence of a difference in atrial fibrillation with 15 out of 41 participants (36.6%) suffering atrial fibrillation in the dopamine intervention group compared with 20 out of 40 participants (50.0%) in the placebo control group (RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.44 to 1.22; 81 participants, 1 study; very low‐certainty evidence; heterogeneity was not applicable) ( Analysis 2.2 ). No RR and resulting estimations of absolute effect on perioperative myocardial infarction were possible since no events were observed in either group ( Analysis 2.3 ).\n\nSecondary outcomes\n\nLength of in‐hospital and intensive care unit stay\n\nThe mean length of in‐hospital stay was similar between study groups, with 10 ± 3 days in the dopamine intervention group compared with 10 ± 4 days in the placebo control group ( Analysis 2.4 ). The length of intensive care unit stay was not reported in the included study.\n\nHaemodynamics (cardiac index, MAP, PCWP)\n\nWhile information on cardiac index and PCWP was not reported in the included study, MAP showed little to no difference between groups (87 ± 10 versus 84 ± 10 mmHg at 24 hours after surgery) ( Analysis 2.5 ).\n\nDuration of mechanical ventilation\n\nThe mean duration of mechanical ventilation in the dopamine intervention group (10 hours) was similar to the placebo control group (mean difference 0.00, 95% CI ‐1.11 to 1.11; 81 participants, 1 study; very low‐certainty evidence; heterogeneity was not applicable) ( Analysis 2.6 ).\n\nProportion of weaning failure within 48 hours of extubation\n\nThis outcome was not reported in the included study.\n\nNumber of patients requiring mechanical circulatory support (IABP)\n\nThis outcome was not reported in the included study.\n\nNumber of patients requiring additional inotropic drugs\n\nWhile no participants in the dopamine intervention group (n = 41) did require additional inotropic drugs, 4 out of 40 participants in the placebo control group required additional inotropic drugs (dopamine). However, the risk ratio showed no evidence of a difference between groups (RR 0.11, 95% CI 0.01 to 1.95) ( Analysis 2.7 ).\n\nNumber of patients requiring cardiac transplantation, ventricular assist device (VAD) implantation or cardiopulmonary resuscitation\n\nThese outcomes were not reported in the included study.\n\nProportion of renal failure\n\nNo participant suffered from renal failure in the dopamine intervention group (n = 41) compared to 4 out of 40 participants in the placebo control group. However, the risk ratio demonstrated no evidence of a difference between groups (RR 0.11, 95% CI 0.01 to 1.95) ( Analysis 2.8 ).\n\nQuality of life\n\nThis outcome was not reported in the included study.\n\nMilrinone versus placebo\n\nThree small, single‐centre trials covering 150 participants ( Hadadzadeh 2013 ; Jo 2010 ; Kikura 2002 ) and one multicentre trial with 124 participants ( Denault 2016 ) investigated milrinone compared to placebo.\n\nPrimary outcomes\n\nAll‐cause mortality (within 30 days)\n\nInformation on mortality within 30 days was restricted to two studies ( Hadadzadeh 2013 ; Jo 2010 ). However, the relative effect was only generated from one trial ( Hadadzadeh 2013 ), while the relative effect from Jo 2010 was not estimable since no events were observed in either group. When milrinone was compared to the placebo group, there was no evidence of a difference in all‐cause mortality within 30 days (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.06 to 15.44; 40 participants, 1 study; low‐certainty evidence; heterogeneity was not applicable) ( Analysis 3.1 ).\n\nIncidence of LCOS\n\nThis outcome was not reported in any of the included studies.\n\nAdverse events\n\nFor adverse events, there was only one study with limited quantitative data for each outcome: non‐embolic stroke/transient ischaemic attack data were provided by Jo 2010 , and cardiogenic shock, atrial fibrillation, and perioperative myocardial infarction data were contributed by Hadadzadeh 2013 .\n\nAll four adverse event outcomes showed little to no difference between groups. For example, 1 out of 40 participants experienced a cardiogenic shock in both the milrinone (2.5%) and placebo groups (2.5%) with a risk ratio of 1.00 (95% CI 0.06 to 15.44; 80 participants, 1 study; low‐certainty evidence; heterogeneity was not applicable) ( Analysis 3.2 ). Moreover, 2 out of 40 participants (5%) suffered atrial fibrillation in the milrinone group compared with 3 out of 40 participants (7.5%) in the placebo group (RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.12 to 3.78; 80 participants, 1 study; low‐certainty evidence; heterogeneity was not applicable) ( Analysis 3.3 ). For perioperative myocardial infarction, 4 out of 40 patients (10%) had this event in the milrinone intervention group compared with 9 out of 40 patients (22.5%) in the placebo control group (RR 0.44, 95% CI 0.15 to 1.33; 80 participants, 1 study; low‐certainty evidence; heterogeneity was not applicable) ( Analysis 3.4 ). Similarly, Jo 2010 narratively reported similar rates of perioperative myocardial infarction between the study groups. Lastly, there was no participant who suffered from non‐embolic stroke/transient ischaemic attack in the milrinone group compared with 1 out of 20 participants (5%) in the placebo group (RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.01 to 7.72; 40 participants, 1 study; low‐certainty evidence; heterogeneity was not applicable) ( Analysis 3.5 ).\n\nSecondary outcomes\n\nLength of in‐hospital and intensive care unit stay\n\nInformation on the length of in‐hospital stay was restricted to Denault 2016 (8 (IQR 6 to 11) versus 7 (IQR 5 to 10) days). Information on the length of intensive care unit stay was restricted to Hadadzadeh 2013 and Denault 2016 . Hadadzadeh 2013 reported that the mean length of stay in intensive care in the placebo control group was 2.5 ± 0.59 days. In the milrinone intervention group, the mean length of intensive care stay was 0.15 days shorter (mean difference ‐0.15, 95% CI ‐0.40 to 0.10) ( Analysis 3.6 ). Denault 2016 reported similar median durations of intensive care in both study groups (1.79 (IQR 0.89 to 3.15) versus 1.09 (IQR 0.90 to 2.95) days).\n\nHaemodynamics (cardiac index, MAP, PCWP)\n\nInformation on cardiac index was restricted to two studies ( Jo 2010 ; Kikura 2002 ). There was little to no difference in mean cardiac index at end of surgery with a mean difference of 0.10 (95% CI ‐0.22 to 0.42; 40 participants, 1 study; heterogeneity was not applicable) ( Analysis 3.7 ). However, at 6 hours after surgery and 12 hours after surgery, the mean cardiac index differed between groups with mean differences of 0.50 (95% CI 0.29 to 0.71; 70 participants, 2 studies; low heterogeneity) and 0.50 (95% CI 0.25 to 0.75; 40 participants, 1 study; heterogeneity was not applicable), respectively ( Analysis 3.7 ).\n\nFor MAP, there were two included studies that reported quantitative data ( Denault 2016 ; Jo 2010 ). Denault 2016 focussed on the perioperative period until the end of surgery. Jo 2010 covered the postoperative period from the end of surgery until 12 hours after surgery. There was little to no difference in mean MAP between groups at baseline (mean difference 2.00, 95% CI ‐2.23 to 6.23; 124 participants, 1 study; heterogeneity was not applicable), at end of surgery (mean difference ‐1.66, 95% CI ‐5.43 to 2.12; 164 participants, 2 studies; low heterogeneity), 6 hours after surgery (mean difference ‐3.00, 95% CI ‐9.82 to 3.82; 40 participants, 1 study; heterogeneity was not applicable), and 12 hours after surgery (mean difference ‐1.00, 95% CI ‐8.19 to 6.19; 40 participants, 1 study; heterogeneity was not applicable) ( Analysis 3.8 ). Kikura 2002 reported no quantitative data but claimed no differences between the study groups in the observation period 7 to 10 hours after CPB.\n\nThere was only one included study providing means of PCWP at three time points (at end of surgery, 6 and 12 hours after surgery) ( Jo 2010 ). There was little to no difference in mean PCWP between groups at the end of surgery and at 12 hours after surgery with mean differences of ‐3.00 (95% CI ‐6.74 to 0.74) and ‐3.00 (95% CI ‐8.00 to 2.00), respectively ( Analysis 3.9 ). However, at 6 hours after surgery, the mean PCWP differed between groups (mean differences ‐4.00, 95% CI ‐7.16 to ‐0.84; 40 participants, 1 study; heterogeneity was not applicable) ( Analysis 3.9 ).\n\nDuration of mechanical ventilation\n\nInformation on this outcome was provided by Hadadzadeh 2013 and Denault 2016 . Hadadzadeh 2013 showed that the mean duration of mechanical ventilation in the placebo control group was 14.3 hours. The mean duration of mechanical ventilation in the milrinone intervention group was 3.98 hours lower (95% CI ‐7.28 to ‐0.68) ( Analysis 3.10 ). Denault 2016 reported a median duration of mechanical ventilation of 8.5 (IQR 5.3 to 18.2) days in the milrinone intervention group compared with 6.8 (IQR 4.4 to 17) days in the placebo control group.\n\nProportion of weaning failure within 48 hours of extubation\n\nInformation on the proportion of weaning failure was reported by Denault 2016 and Jo 2010 , covering 164 participants. The risk ratio demonstrated no evidence of a difference between the milrinone intervention group and the placebo control group (RR 1.17, 95% CI 0.37 to 3.69) ( Analysis 3.11 ).\n\nNumber of patients requiring mechanical circulatory support (IABP)\n\nInformation on the number of patients requiring mechanical circulatory support was provided by two studies ( Denault 2016 ; Hadadzadeh 2013 ). In the milrinone group, 3 out of 103 participants required mechanical circulatory support compared to 8 out of 101 participants in the control group. However, no evidence of a difference was found in the risk ratio between groups (RR 0.41, 95% CI 0.13 to 1.35; 204 participants, 2 studies; moderate‐certainty evidence; low heterogeneity) ( Analysis 3.12 ).\n\nNumber of patients requiring additional inotropic drugs\n\nFor overall additional inotropic drugs (without reporting a specific drug type or name), two studies reported that 36 out of 103 patients required additional inotropic drugs in the milrinone intervention group compared to 38 out of 101 patients in the placebo control group ( Denault 2016 ; Hadadzadeh 2013 ). Little to no difference was found between groups (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.31; 204 participants, 2 studies; low heterogeneity) ( Analysis 3.13 ).\n\nWithin this outcome category, Denault 2016 also reported on specific inotropic drugs, i.e. epinephrine, norepinephrine, dobutamine, phenylephrine, and additional milrinone. In detail, 9 out of 63 participants in the milrinone group required additional epinephrine compared to 7 out of 61 participants in the control group (RR 1.24, 95% CI 0.49 to 3.13) ( Analysis 3.14 ), and 8 out of 63 participants in the milrinone group required additional norepinephrine compared to 8 out of 61 participants in the placebo control group (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.39 to 2.42) ( Analysis 3.15 ). In addition, Denault 2016 stated that 2 out of 63 participants required additional dobutamine in the milrinone group compared to 1 out of 61 participants in the control group and little to no difference was found between groups (RR 1.94, 95% CI 0.18 to 20.81) ( Analysis 3.16 ). Denault 2016 also provided information on the number of patients that required additional phenylephrine. While no participants required additional phenylephrine in the milrinone group (n = 63), 1 out of 61 participants was in need of phenylephrine in the control group (RR 0.32, 95% CI 0.01 to 7.78) ( Analysis 3.17 ). Notably, in each case, 8 participants in the intervention group (n = 63) and the control group (n = 61) received additional milrinone.\n\nKikura 2002 reported that dopamine was administered when needed with the mean total dose of dopamine given in the first 24 hours after surgery being significantly lower in the milrinone intervention group compared to the placebo control group. No information was given on the number of patients who received additional dopamine.\n\nNumber of patients requiring cardiac transplantation, ventricular assist device (VAD) implantation or cardiopulmonary resuscitation\n\nThese outcomes were not reported in any of the included studies.\n\nProportion of renal failure\n\nInformation on the proportion of renal failure was restricted to two included studies with 120 participants ( Hadadzadeh 2013 ; Jo 2010 ). There were 2 out of 60 patients suffering from renal failure in the milrinone group compared to 5 out of 60 patients in the control group. However, no evidence of a difference in risk ratio was found between groups (RR 0.40, 95% CI 0.08 to 2.01) ( Analysis 3.18 ).\n\nQuality of life\n\nThis outcome was not reported in any of the included studies.\n\nLevosimendan versus dobutamine\n\nTwo small, single‐centre trials with 140 participants investigated levosimendan compared to dobutamine ( Gandham 2013 ; Kandasamy 2017 ).\n\nPrimary outcomes\n\nAll‐cause mortality (within 30 days)\n\nThis outcome was not reported in any of the included studies.\n\nIncidence of LCOS\n\nThis outcome was not reported in any of the included studies.\n\nAdverse events\n\nInformation in both included studies was restricted to atrial fibrillation ( Gandham 2013 ; Kandasamy 2017 ). The study authors did not report on cardiogenic shock, non‐embolic stroke/transient ischaemic attack or perioperative myocardial infarction. There were 8 out of 70 patients suffering from atrial fibrillation in the levosimendan intervention group compared with 15 out of 70 patients in the dobutamine control group and little to no difference in risk ratio was found between groups (RR 0.53, 95% CI 0.16 to 1.75; 140 participants, 2 studies; low‐certainty evidence; moderate heterogeneity) ( Analysis 4.1 ).\n\nSecondary outcomes\n\nLength of in‐hospital and intensive care unit stay\n\nInformation on the length of in‐hospital stay was restricted to Kandasamy 2017 . The mean stay in hospital in the control group with dobutamine was 6.85 days. The mean length of in‐hospital stay in the levosimendan group was 0.97 days shorter (95% CI ‐1.28 to ‐0.66) ( Analysis 4.2 ).\n\nInformation on the length of intensive care stay was reported by both included studies. The mean length of stay in intensive care in the control group with dobutamine was 2.8 to 3.2 days. The mean length of intensive care stay in the levosimendan group was 0.29 days shorter (95% CI ‐0.51 to ‐0.08; 140 participants, 2 studies; moderate‐certainty evidence; low heterogeneity) ( Analysis 4.3 ).\n\nHaemodynamics (cardiac index, MAP, PCWP)\n\nInformation on cardiac index was restricted to Gandham 2013 , which showed little to no difference at baseline, 6 hours and 12 hours after surgery ( Analysis 4.4 ). However, there was a difference at 24 hours after surgery between groups and this outcome was favourable to the levosimendan group compared to the dobutamine group (mean difference 0.46, 95% CI 0.35 to 0.57; 60 participants, 1 study; heterogeneity was not applicable) ( Analysis 4.4 ).\n\nMAP was reported by both included studies ( Gandham 2013 ; Kandasamy 2017 ). No evidence of a difference in mean MAP between the levosimendan intervention group and the dobutamine control group was observed at baseline with ‐0.06 (95% CI ‐2.11 to 2.00) and at 24 hours after surgery with ‐5.42 (95% CI ‐12.52 to 1.68). Instead, at 6 hours and 12 hours after surgery, the mean MAP was lower in the levosimendan intervention group compared with the dopamine control group (mean difference at 6 hours post‐surgery ‐9.27, 95% CI ‐14.18 to ‐4.36; mean difference at 12 hours post‐surgery ‐9.17, 95% CI ‐10.85 to ‐7.50) ( Analysis 4.5 ).\n\nInformation on PCWP was restricted to Kandasamy 2017 . There was little to no difference in mean PCWP between groups at baseline (mean difference 0.63, 95% CI ‐0.07 to 1.33). At 6 hours, 12 hours and 24 hours after surgery, however, the mean PCWP was reduced in the levosimendan group compared with control with ‐2.47 (95% CI ‐3.04 to ‐1.90), ‐2.42 (95% CI ‐2.90 to ‐1.94), and ‐1.45 (95% CI ‐1.92 to ‐0.98), respectively ( Analysis 4.6 ).\n\nDuration of mechanical ventilation\n\nInformation on this outcome was provided by both included studies, which reported that the mean of duration of mechanical ventilation was lower (mean difference ‐1.04, 95% CI ‐1.72 to ‐0.35) in the intervention group with levosimendan compared to 5.97 to 7.40 hours in the control group with dobutamine (140 participants, 2 studies; low‐certainty evidence; low heterogeneity) ( Analysis 4.7 ).\n\nProportion of weaning failure within 48 hours of extubation\n\nThis outcome was not reported in any of the included studies.\n\nNumber of patients requiring mechanical circulatory support (IABP)\n\nOnly one study provided this outcome ( Kandasamy 2017 ), and reported that 1 out of 40 participants required mechanical circulatory support in both intervention and control groups ( Analysis 4.8 ). Accordingly, no evidence of a difference was found in the risk ratio for this outcome between groups (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.06 to 15.44; 80 participants, 1 study; low‐certainty evidence; heterogeneity was not applicable) ( Analysis 4.8 ).\n\nNumber of patients requiring additional inotropic drugs\n\nThe need for overall additional inotropic drugs was restricted to Gandham 2013 , who reported that 21 out of 30 patients required additional inotropic drugs in the intervention group with levosimendan compared to 4 out of 30 patients in the dobutamine control group. There was a difference in risk ratio between groups favouring dobutamine (RR 5.25, 95% CI 2.05 to 13.47; 60 participants, 1 study; heterogeneity not applicable) ( Analysis 4.9 ).\n\nWithin this outcome category, both included studies reported on specific inotropic drugs, i.e. epinephrine and norepinephrine. Regarding epinephrine, 9 out of 70 participants in the levosimendan group compared to 5 out of 70 participants in the control group received this additional inotropic support (RR 1.63, 95% CI 0.32 to 8.23) ( Analysis 4.10 ). In addition, it was stated that 28 out of 70 participants in the levosimendan group and 8 out of 70 participants in the dobutamine control group required additional norepinephrine (RR 3.52, 95% CI 1.21 to 10.24) ( Analysis 4.11 ).\n\nNumber of patients requiring cardiac transplantation, ventricular assist device (VAD) implantation or cardiopulmonary resuscitation\n\nThese outcomes were not reported in any of the included studies.\n\nProportion of renal failure\n\nThis outcome was not reported in any of the included studies.\n\nQuality of life\n\nThis outcome was not reported in any of the included studies.\n\nLevosimendan versus standard cardiac care\n\nThree small, single‐centre trials with 208 participants investigated the effect of levosimendan compared to standard cardiac care ( Baysal 2014 ; Desai 2018 ; Ersoy 2013 ). See Table 1 .\n\nPrimary outcomes\n\nAll‐cause mortality (within 30 days)\n\nInformation on mortality within 30 days was found in all three included studies. However, the relative effect was only generated from two trials ( Baysal 2014 ; Desai 2018 ), while the relative risk from Ersoy 2013 was not estimable due to no events being observed in either group. When levosimendan was compared to the standard cardiac care group, there was no evidence of a difference in all‐cause mortality within 30 days (RR 0.37, 95% CI 0.13 to 1.04; 208 participants, 3 studies; low‐certainty evidence; low heterogeneity) ( Analysis 5.1 ; Table 1 ).\n\nIncidence of LCOS\n\nInformation on LCOS was reported by all three studies. As with 30‐day mortality, the relative effect was solely generated from two trials ( Baysal 2014 ; Desai 2018 ), while the relative risk from Ersoy 2013 was not estimable since no events were observed in either group. When the levosimendan intervention group was compared to the control group receiving standard cardiac care, there was little to no difference in LCOS (RR 0.49, 95% CI 0.14 to 1.73; 208 participants, 3 studies; very low‐certainty evidence; moderate heterogeneity) ( Analysis 5.2 ; Table 1 ).\n\nAdverse events\n\nInformation on atrial fibrillation was restricted to two studies ( Baysal 2014 ; Desai 2018 ). Only Baysal 2014 reported on cardiogenic shock, perioperative myocardial infarction, and non‐embolic stroke/transient ischaemic attack.\n\nWhen levosimendan was compared to the standard cardiac care group, there was no evidence of a difference in any of the four adverse events. Five out of 64 patients suffered from cardiogenic shock in the levosimendan group compared to 8 out of 64 patients in the standard cardiac care group (RR 0.63, 95% CI 0.22 to 1.81; 128 participants, 1 study; very low‐certainty evidence; heterogeneity was not applicable) ( Analysis 5.3 ; Table 1 ). There were 10 out of 94 patients suffering from atrial fibrillation in the levosimendan intervention group compared with 23 out of 94 in the standard cardiac care group (RR 0.40, 95% CI 0.11 to 1.41; 188 participants, 2 studies; very low‐certainty evidence; moderate heterogeneity) ( Analysis 5.4 ). Five out 64 participants were afflicted with perioperative myocardial infarction in the levosimendan group compared to 8 out of 64 participants in the standard cardiac care group (RR 0.63, 95% CI 0.22 to 1.81; 128 participants, 1 study; very low‐certainty evidence; heterogeneity was not applicable) ( Analysis 5.5 ). There were 9 out of 64 participants suffering from non‐embolic stroke/transient ischaemic attack in the levosimendan group compared to 16 out of 64 participants in the standard cardiac care group (RR 0.56, 95% CI 0.27 to 1.18; 128 participants, 1 study; very low‐certainty evidence; heterogeneity was not applicable) ( Analysis 5.6 ).\n\nSecondary outcomes\n\nLength of in‐hospital and intensive care unit stay\n\nThere was little to no difference between the study groups in terms of mean length of in‐hospital stay as shown by Analysis 5.7 based on data from Desai 2018 and Ersoy 2013 (mean difference 0.70, 95% CI ‐1.50 to 2.91; 80 participants, 2 studies; substantial heterogeneity). Likewise, Baysal 2014 documented related median durations of hospital care in both study groups with notable intra‐group variability (8.0 (IQR 7.0 to 38.0) versus 9.0 (IQR 7.0 to 37.0) days).\n\nDesai 2018 reported the mean length of stay in intensive care in the control group receiving standard cardiac care to be 3.67 ± 0.76 days. In the levosimendan group, the mean length of intensive care was 0.27 days shorter (95% CI ‐0.62 to 0.08). Ersoy 2013 reported that the mean length of stay in intensive care in the control group was 1.4 ± 1.3 days. In the levosimendan intervention group, the mean length of intensive care was 1.30 days longer (95% CI ‐0.23 to 2.83). Altogether, there was no evidence of a difference in the mean length of stay in the intensive care unit between groups (mean difference 0.33, 95% CI ‐1.16 to 1.83; 80 participants, 2 studies; very low‐certainty evidence; substantial heterogeneity) ( Analysis 5.8 ; Table 1 ). Baysal 2014 reported similar median durations of intensive care in both study groups with wide intra‐group variability (4.0 (IQR 1.0 to 4.0) versus 5.0 (IQR 2.0 to 37.0) days).\n\nHaemodynamics (cardiac index, MAP, PCWP)\n\nInformation on cardiac index was provided by Baysal 2014 , Desai 2018 , and Ersoy 2013 . There was little to no difference at baseline (mean difference 0.00, 95% CI ‐0.10 to 0.10; 208 participants, 3 studies; low heterogeneity). However, there were differences at the end of surgery as well as 6 hours, 12 hours, and 24 hours after surgery between groups and this outcome was favourable to the levosimendan group compared to the standard cardiac care group (mean difference at end of surgery 0.52, 95% CI 0.32 to 0.73; 188 participants, 2 studies; moderate heterogeneity; mean difference at 6 hours post surgery 0.77, 95% CI 0.64 to 0.89; 188 participants, 2 studies; low heterogeneity; mean difference at 12 hours post surgery 0.55, 95% CI 0.34 to 0.76; 60 participants, 1 study; heterogeneity was not applicable; and mean difference at 24 hours post surgery 0.47, 95% CI 0.35 to 0.58; 188 participants, 2 studies; low heterogeneity) ( Analysis 5.9 ).\n\nMAP was only reported by Baysal 2014 and Desai 2018 . Little to no difference in mean MAP between the levosimendan intervention group and the standard cardiac care control group was observed at the time points at which quantitative data were available from both studies, i.e. at baseline with 0.41 (95% CI ‐0.78 to 1.59), at end of surgery with 2.39 (95% CI ‐8.74 to 13.52), at 6 hours after surgery with ‐1.11 (95% CI ‐2.36 to 0.14), and at 24 hours after surgery with 3.54 (95% CI ‐0.06 to 7.15) ( Analysis 5.10 ). However, at 12 hours after surgery (a time point that was only available for Desai 2018 ) the mean MAP was higher in the levosimendan intervention group compared with the standard cardiac care control group (mean difference 4.07, 95% CI 1.03 to 7.11) ( Analysis 5.10 ).\n\nInformation on PCWP was restricted to Baysal 2014 and Desai 2018 . Baysal 2014 narratively reported no significant differences between study groups. In the study Desai 2018 there was no evidence of a difference in mean PCWP between groups at baseline (mean difference 0.50, 95% CI ‐0.63 to 1.63) and 24 hours after surgery (mean difference ‐0.73, 95% CI ‐1.48 to 0.02) ( Analysis 5.11 ). However, at the end of surgery, 6 hours and 12 hours after surgery, the mean PCWP was reduced in the levosimendan group compared with the standard cardiac care control group with ‐2.07 (95% CI ‐3.06 to ‐1.08), ‐1.21 (95% CI ‐2.22 to ‐0.20), and ‐1.04 (95% CI ‐1.69 to ‐0.39), respectively ( Analysis 5.11 ).\n\nDuration of mechanical ventilation\n\nInformation on this outcome was provided only by Baysal 2014 . The included study showed that the mean duration of mechanical ventilation in the standard cardiac care control group was 83.2 hours. The mean duration of mechanical ventilation in the levosimendan intervention group was 3.40 hours lower (95% CI ‐11.50 to 4.70; 128 participants, 1 study; very low‐certainty evidence; heterogeneity not applicable) ( Analysis 5.12 ; Table 1 ).\n\nProportion of weaning failure within 48 hours of extubation\n\nInformation on the proportion of weaning failure was restricted to Baysal 2014 , which found little to no difference between the levosimendan and standard cardiac care group (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.36 to 1.84; 128 participants, 1 study; very low‐certainty evidence; heterogeneity was not applicable) ( Analysis 5.13 ).\n\nNumber of patients requiring mechanical circulatory support (IABP)\n\nInformation on the number of patients requiring mechanical circulatory support was given by all three included studies. However, the relative effect was only generated from two trials ( Baysal 2014 ; Desai 2018 ), while the relative risk from Ersoy 2013 was not estimable due to no events being observed in either group. In the levosimendan intervention group, 17 out of 104 patients required mechanical circulatory support compared to 20 out of 104 patients in the standard cardiac care control group. However, no evidence of a difference was found in the risk ratio between groups (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.50 to 1.55; 208 participants, 3 studies; low‐certainty evidence; low heterogeneity) ( Analysis 5.14 ; Table 1 ).\n\nNumber of patients requiring additional inotropic drugs\n\nThe need for overall additional inotropic drugs was restricted to Desai 2018 and Ersoy 2013 , who reported that 28 out of 40 patients required additional inotropic drugs in the intervention group with levosimendan compared to 16 out of 40 patients in the standard cardiac care control group. There was a difference in risk ratio between groups favouring standard cardiac care (RR 1.70, 95% CI 1.13 to 2.57; 80 participants, 2 studies; low heterogeneity) ( Analysis 5.15 ).\n\nWithin this outcome category, information on specific inotropic drugs, i.e. epinephrine, dopamine, and dobutamine, was reported by Baysal 2014 , while information on norepinephrine was provided by Baysal 2014 and Desai 2018 . There was little to no difference in risk ratio between groups for all of these inotropic drugs. Regarding epinephrine, 16 out of 64 participants in the levosimendan group compared to 23 out of 64 participants in the standard cardiac care control group received this additional inotropic support (RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.41 to 1.19) ( Analysis 5.16 ). Additional norepinephrine was required by 41 out of 94 patients in the levosimendan group and 36 out of 94 patients in the standard cardiac care group (RR 1.18, 95% CI 0.58 to 2.37) ( Analysis 5.17 ). Moreover, 31 out of 64 participants in the levosimendan group and 40 out of 64 participants in the standard cardiac care control group required additional dopamine (RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.56 to 1.06) ( Analysis 5.18 ). Lastly, 55 out of 64 participants in the levosimendan group compared to 53 out of 64 participants in the standard cardiac care control group required additional dobutamine (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.20) ( Analysis 5.19 ).\n\nNumber of patients requiring cardiac transplantation, ventricular assist device (VAD) implantation or cardiopulmonary resuscitation\n\nInformation on these outcomes was restricted to Baysal 2014 . The relative risk of cardiac transplantation or VAD implantation was not estimable since no events were observed in either group ( Analysis 5.20 ). In the intervention group with levosimendan, 4 out of 64 patients required cardiopulmonary resuscitation compared to 10 out of 64 patients in the standard cardiac care control group. However, no evidence of a difference was found in the risk ratio between groups (RR 0.40, 95% CI 0.13 to 1.21; 128 participants, 1 study; heterogeneity was not applicable) ( Analysis 5.21 ).\n\nProportion of renal failure\n\nAll three studies reported on the proportion of renal failure. Ersoy 2013 observed no events in either group. Therefore, the relative effect was only generated from Baysal 2014 and Desai 2018 . In the levosimendan intervention group, 8 out of 104 patients suffered from renal failure compared with 17 out of 104 patients in the standard cardiac care control group. No evidence of a difference was found in the risk ratio between groups (RR 0.48, 95% CI 0.22 to 1.08; 208 participants, 3 studies; low heterogeneity) ( Analysis 5.22 ).\n\nQuality of life\n\nOnly Ersoy 2013 narratively reported this outcome, while Baysal 2014 and Desai 2018 did not report it. Ersoy 2013 stated that no marked adverse reaction to the study drug was observed in the levosimendan group.\n\nLevosimendan versus milrinone\n\nThree small, single‐centre trials with 130 participants investigated the effect of levosimendan compared to milrinone ( Amin 2019 ; De Hert 2007 ; Mishra 2016 ).\n\nPrimary outcomes\n\nAll‐cause mortality (within 30 days)\n\nInformation on mortality within 30 days was restricted to two studies ( De Hert 2007 ; Mishra 2016 ). However, the relative effect was only generated from De Hert 2007 , while the relative risk in Mishra 2016 was not estimable due to no events being observed in either group. When levosimendan was compared to milrinone, there was little to no difference in all‐cause mortality within 30 days (RR 0.14, 95% CI 0.01 to 2.55; 70 participants, 2 studies; low‐certainty evidence; heterogeneity was not applicable) ( Analysis 6.1 ).\n\nIncidence of LCOS\n\nThis outcome was not reported in any of the included studies.\n\nAdverse events\n\nWhile information on cardiogenic shock and non‐embolic stroke/transient ischaemic attack was not reported in any of the included studies, information on atrial fibrillation and perioperative myocardial infarction were restricted to one study ( De Hert 2007 ). In the levosimendan intervention group, 6 out of 15 participants suffered from atrial fibrillation compared to 7 out of 15 participants in the milrinone control group; no evidence of a difference was found in the risk ratio between groups (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.38 to 1.95; 30 participants, 1 study; very low‐certainty evidence; heterogeneity was not applicable) ( Analysis 6.2 ). The relative effect on perioperative myocardial infarction was not estimable due to no events being observed in either the levosimendan or milrinone groups ( Analysis 6.3 ).\n\nSecondary outcomes\n\nLength of in‐hospital and intensive care unit stay\n\nInformation on the length of in‐hospital stay was restricted to De Hert 2007 (10 (IQR 7 to 16) versus 12 (IQR 5 to 39) days).\n\nAmin 2019 reported that the mean length of stay in intensive care in the control group receiving milrinone was 4.25 ± 1.75 days. In the levosimendan group, the mean length of intensive care was 0.90 days shorter (mean difference ‐0.90, 95% CI ‐1.67 to ‐0.13). Mishra 2016 reported that the mean length of stay in intensive care in the control group receiving milrinone was 4.56 ± 1.62 days. In the levosimendan intervention group, the mean length of intensive care was 0.31 days shorter (mean difference ‐0.31, 95% CI ‐1.34 to 0.72). Altogether, there was a difference in the mean length of stay in the intensive care unit between groups, favouring levosimendan (mean difference ‐0.69, 95% CI ‐1.31 to ‐0.07; 100 participants, 2 studies; low‐certainty evidence; low heterogeneity) ( Analysis 6.4 ). In line with this, De Hert 2007 reported a similar length of stay in the intensive care unit (2.58 (IQR 1.17 to 5.04) versus 2.75 (IQR 1.42 to 39) days).\n\nHaemodynamics (cardiac index, MAP, PCWP)\n\nThe only available information regarding cardiac index was the narrative statement by Mishra 2016 that the cardiac index was comparable between groups during the study period, except at 6 hours of intensive care, when it was significantly higher in the levosimendan group compared with the milrinone group.\n\nQuantitative data on MAP was only reported by De Hert 2007 with 30 participants. No evidence of a difference in mean MAP between the levosimendan intervention group and the milrinone control group was observed at baseline with 2.00 (95% CI ‐4.60 to 8.60), at end‐of‐surgery with 3.00 (95% CI ‐1.53 to 7.53), at 6 hours after surgery with ‐3.00 (95% CI ‐10.16 to 4.16), at 12 hours after surgery with 0.00 (95% CI ‐6.48 to 6.48), and at 24 hours after surgery with ‐2.00 (95% CI ‐7.01 to 3.01) ( Analysis 6.5 ). Amin 2019 narratively reported no significant differences in MAP from anaesthesia to the first 24 hours in intensive care. Mishra 2016 reported MAP to be comparable in both groups at all time points except at baseline when it was significantly lower in the levosimendan group.\n\nInformation on PCWP was not reported in any of the included studies.\n\nDuration of mechanical ventilation\n\nInformation on this outcome was available in all three included studies. Amin 2019 reported the mean duration of mechanical ventilation in the milrinone group to be 18.76 ± 9.8 hours. The mean duration of mechanical ventilation in the intervention group receiving levosimendan was 6.50 hours lower (mean difference ‐6.50, 95% CI ‐10.65 to ‐2.35). De Hert 2007 reported the mean duration of mechanical ventilation in the milrinone group to be 20 ± 11 hours, whereas in the intervention group receiving levosimendan it was 9 hours lower (mean difference ‐9.00, 95% CI ‐15.60 to ‐2.40). Similarly, Mishra 2016 reported a shorter mean duration of mechanical ventilation in the levosimendan group compared with the milrinone group (15.36 ± 3.32 hours versus 21.87 ± 15.38 hours). In summary, there was a difference in the mean duration of mechanical ventilation between groups, favouring the levosimendan intervention group (mean difference ‐7.06, 95% CI ‐10.19 to ‐3.93; 130 participants, 3 studies; low‐certainty evidence; low heterogeneity) ( Analysis 6.6 ).\n\nProportion of weaning failure within 48 hours of extubation\n\nThis outcome was not reported in any of the included studies.\n\nNumber of patients requiring mechanical circulatory support (IABP)\n\nInformation on the number of patients requiring mechanical circulatory support was restricted to Amin 2019 and De Hert 2007 . Amin 2019 reported that of 30 patients in the levosimendan intervention group, no patient required mechanical circulatory support compared to 3 out of 30 patients in the milrinone control group (RR 0.14, 95% CI 0.01 to 2.65). De Hert 2007 reported that 4 out of 15 patients in both the levosimendan and milrinone groups required mechanical circulatory support (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.31 to 3.28). Altogether, there was little to no difference in the number of patients requiring mechanical circulatory support (RR 0.58, 95% CI 0.09 to 3.55; 90 participants, 2 studies; low‐certainty evidence; low heterogeneity) ( Analysis 6.7 ).\n\nNumber of patients requiring additional inotropic drugs\n\nFor this outcome, quantitative data on specific inotropic drugs, i.e. norepinephrine and dobutamine, were only reported by De Hert 2007 . There was no evidence of a difference in risk ratio between groups for both specific inotropic drugs. Regarding norepinephrine, all 15 participants in both the levosimendan and milrinone groups received this additional inotropic support (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.13) ( Analysis 6.8 ). Similarly, 15 out of 15 participants in levosimendan and milrinone groups required additional dobutamine (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.13) ( Analysis 6.9 ). Mishra 2016 narratively reported that at several time points after termination of cardiopulmonary bypass, more patients in the levosimendan group required significantly higher doses of norepinephrine infusion compared with those in the milrinone group.\n\nNumber of patients requiring cardiac transplantation, ventricular assist device (VAD) implantation or cardiopulmonary resuscitation\n\nThis outcome was not reported in any of the included studies.\n\nProportion of renal failure\n\nThis outcome was not reported in any of the included studies.\n\nQuality of life\n\nThis outcome was not reported in any of the included studies.\n\nLevosimendan versus placebo\n\nTwelve small, single‐centre trials with 869 participants ( Anastasiadis 2016 ; Erb 2014 ; Hu 2020 ; Jävelä 2008 ; Juhl‐Olsen 2015 ; Kodalli 2013 ; Lahtinen 2011 ; Leppikangas 2011 ; Shah 2014 ; Sharma 2014 ; Tritapepe 2006 ; Tritapepe 2009 ), three small, multicentre trials with 645 participants ( Cholley 2017 ; Eriksson 2009 ; Levin 2012 ), and one large, multicentre trial with 849 participants ( Mehta 2017 ) investigated levosimendan compared to placebo. See Table 2 .\n\nPrimary outcomes\n\nAll‐cause mortality (within 30 days)\n\nInformation on mortality within 30 days was found in 14 included studies ( Anastasiadis 2016 ; Cholley 2017 ; Erb 2014 ; Eriksson 2009 ; Hu 2020 ; Jävelä 2008 ; Juhl‐Olsen 2015 ; Kodalli 2013 ; Lahtinen 2011 ; Levin 2012 ; Mehta 2017 ; Shah 2014 ; Sharma 2014 ; Tritapepe 2009 ). However, the relative effect was only generated from 11 included studies ( Anastasiadis 2016 ; Cholley 2017 ; Erb 2014 ; Eriksson 2009 ; Hu 2020 ; Jävelä 2008 ; Lahtinen 2011 ; Levin 2012 ; Mehta 2017 ; Shah 2014 ; Sharma 2014 ), while the relative risk in Juhl‐Olsen 2015 , Kodalli 2013 , and Tritapepe 2009 was not estimable due to no events being observed in either group. When levosimendan was compared to the control group, there was a small effect to no difference in all‐cause mortality within 30 days, favouring the levosimendan group (RR 0.65, 95% CI 0.43 to 0.97; 2347 participants, 14 studies; moderate‐certainty evidence; low heterogeneity; no indication of reporting bias) ( Analysis 7.1 ; Figure 4 ; Table 2 ). Derived from that risk difference, the number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) is 44.\n\nIncidence of LCOS\n\nInformation on LCOS was reported by six studies ( Cholley 2017 ; Lahtinen 2011 ; Levin 2012 ; Mehta 2017 ; Shah 2014 ; Sharma 2014 ). When the levosimendan intervention group was compared to the control group receiving placebo, there were differences in LCOS and this effect was favourable to the levosimendan group (RR 0.43, 95% CI 0.25 to 0.74; 1724 participants, 6 studies; low‐certainty evidence; substantial heterogeneity) ( Analysis 7.2 ; Table 2 ). Derived from that risk difference, the calculated NNTB is 8.\n\nAdverse events\n\nInformation on cardiogenic shock was restricted to Cholley 2017 , Kodalli 2013 , and Mehta 2017 , but the relative effect was only provided by Cholley 2017 and Mehta 2017 , while the risk ratio from Kodalli 2013 was not estimable due to no events being observed in either group. Information on atrial fibrillation was provided by 11 studies ( Anastasiadis 2016 ; Cholley 2017 ; Juhl‐Olsen 2015 ; Kodalli 2013 ; Lahtinen 2011 ; Levin 2012 ; Mehta 2017 ; Shah 2014 ; Sharma 2014 ; Tritapepe 2006 ; Tritapepe 2009 ). However, the relative effect was only generated from 10 included studies ( Anastasiadis 2016 ; Cholley 2017 ; Juhl‐Olsen 2015 ; Lahtinen 2011 ; Levin 2012 ; Mehta 2017 ; Shah 2014 ; Sharma 2014 ; Tritapepe 2006 ; Tritapepe 2009 ), while the risk ratio from Kodalli 2013 was not estimable due to no events being observed in either group. Information on perioperative myocardial infarction was found in eight studies ( Anastasiadis 2016 ; Cholley 2017 ; Kodalli 2013 ; Lahtinen 2011 ; Levin 2012 ; Mehta 2017 ; Sharma 2014 ; Tritapepe 2009 ). However, the relative effect was only generated from six included studies ( Cholley 2017 ; Lahtinen 2011 ; Levin 2012 ; Mehta 2017 ; Sharma 2014 ; Tritapepe 2009 ), while the risk ratio from Anastasiadis 2016 and Kodalli 2013 was not estimable due to no events being observed in either group. Eight studies reported on non‐embolic stroke/transient ischaemic attack ( Anastasiadis 2016 ; Cholley 2017 ; Kodalli 2013 ; Lahtinen 2011 ; Levin 2012 ; Mehta 2017 ; Shah 2014 ; Sharma 2014 ). Similar to atrial fibrillation and cardiogenic shock, only Kodalli 2013 was unable to provide the risk ratio due to no events being observed in either group. Erb 2014 narratively reported that the rates of any serious adverse events were significantly reduced in the levosimendan group compared with the placebo group.\n\nWhen levosimendan was compared to the control group, there was little to no difference in all four adverse events. Twenty‐five out of 610 participants suffered from cardiogenic shock in the levosimendan group compared to 38 out of 602 in the control group (RR 0.65, 95% CI 0.40 to 1.05; 1212 participants, 3 studies; high‐certainty evidence; low heterogeneity) ( Analysis 7.3 ; Table 2 ). There were 375 out of 971 patients suffering from atrial fibrillation in the levosimendan intervention group compared with 356 out of 963 in the placebo control group (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.27; 1934 participants, 11 studies; low‐certainty evidence; substantial heterogeneity, indication of reporting bias) ( Analysis 7.4 ; Figure 5 ). Eighty‐six out 924 participants were afflicted with perioperative myocardial infarction in the levosimendan group compared to 94 out of 914 participants in the control group (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.61 to 1.31; 1838 participants, 8 studies; moderate‐certainty evidence; low heterogeneity) ( Analysis 7.5 ). There were 36 out of 897 participants suffering from non‐embolic stroke/transient ischaemic attack in the levosimendan group compared to 44 out of 889 participants in the control group (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.58 to 1.38; 1786 participants, 8 studies; moderate‐certainty evidence; low heterogeneity) ( Analysis 7.6 ).\n\nSecondary outcomes\n\nLength of in‐hospital and intensive care unit stay\n\nThere were six studies reporting the mean length of stay in hospital ( Anastasiadis 2016 ; Lahtinen 2011 ; Leppikangas 2011 ; Sharma 2014 ; Tritapepe 2006 ; Tritapepe 2009 ). All showed a similar trend of an observed lower mean length of stay in hospital among patients in the levosimendan group compared to the control group. Altogether, the meta‐analysis revealed a difference in the mean length of stay in hospital between groups, favouring the levosimendan intervention group (mean difference ‐1.80, 95% CI ‐3.27 to ‐0.33; 422 participants, 6 studies; considerable heterogeneity) ( Analysis 7.7 ). IQR data were reported by Cholley 2017 and Erb 2014 . While Cholley 2017 reported identical lengths of hospital stay for both groups (7 (IQR 5 to 10) days), Erb 2014 observed a lower median length of stay in hospital in the levosimendan group compared to the placebo group (12 (IQR 10.25 to 21.75) versus 13.5 (IQR 10.25 to 21.5) days).\n\nThe relative effect of levosimendan compared to placebo on length of intensive care stay was generated from seven included studies ( Anastasiadis 2016 ; Hu 2020 ; Kodalli 2013 ; Leppikangas 2011 ; Sharma 2014 ; Tritapepe 2006 ; Tritapepe 2009 ). In these studies, the mean length of stay in intensive care varied from 1.07 to 8.15 days in the placebo control group. All reported a lower mean length of stay observed in the levosimendan intervention group compared to the control group. Accordingly, the meta‐analysis revealed a difference in the mean length of stay in intensive care between groups, favouring the levosimendan group (mean difference ‐1.00, 95% CI ‐1.63 to ‐0.37; 572 participants, 7 studies; very low‐certainty evidence; considerable heterogeneity) ( Analysis 7.8 ; Table 2 ). In five studies, information on length of stay in intensive care was restricted to IQR data. For this, Cholley 2017 , Eriksson 2009 , and Mehta 2017 reported a similar length of stay in both study groups ( Cholley 2017 : 4 (IQR 2 to 7) versus 4 (IQR 3 to 6) days; Eriksson 2009 : 2 (IQR 1 to 33) versus 2 (IQR 1 to 31) days; Mehta 2017 : 2.8 (IQR 1.6 to 4.8) versus 2.9 (IQR 1.8 to 4.9) days). However, Erb 2014 observed a length of stay in intensive care of 3.0 (IQR 1.5 to 7.0) days in the levosimendan group compared with 5.0 (IQR 4.0 to 13.8) days in the placebo group, and Juhl‐Olsen 2015 reported a length of stay in intensive care of 0.79 (IQR 0.65 to 1.28) days in the levosimendan group compared with 0.83 (IQR 0.75 to 5.80) days in the placebo group. Jävelä 2008 narratively stated that length of stay was similar between study groups.\n\nHaemodynamics (cardiac index, MAP, PCWP)\n\nQuantitative information on mean cardiac index was provided by Anastasiadis 2016 , Hu 2020 , Jävelä 2008 , Kodalli 2013 , and Shah 2014 . Little to no difference in mean cardiac index between the levosimendan intervention group and the placebo control group was reported by these studies at baseline with ‐0.04 (95% CI ‐0.17 to 0.10; 456 participants, 5 studies; moderate heterogeneity) and at end of surgery with 0.67 (95% CI ‐0.20 to 1.53; 74 participants, 2 studies; considerable heterogeneity) as reported by Jävelä 2008 and Shah 2014 ( Analysis 7.9 ). However, there were differences in mean cardiac index between groups at 6 hours, 12 hours, and 24 hours after surgery that were all favourable to levosimendan ( Analysis 7.9 ). For example, Jävelä 2008 and Kodalli 2013 reported that the mean difference in cardiac index between groups at 6 hours after surgery was 0.68 (95% CI 0.28 to 1.09; 54 participants, 2 studies; low heterogeneity). In addition, Jävelä 2008 , Kodalli 2013 , and Shah 2014 reported a mean difference in cardiac index between groups at 12 hours after surgery of 0.73 (95% CI 0.23 to 1.23; 104 participants, 3 studies; substantial heterogeneity). Moreover, all included studies reported that the mean difference in cardiac index between groups at 24 hours after surgery was 0.51 (95% CI 0.06 to 0.96; 456 participants, 5 studies; considerable heterogeneity). There was narrative information on cardiac index from Erb 2014 , Eriksson 2009 , Juhl‐Olsen 2015 , Lahtinen 2011 , Leppikangas 2011 , Levin 2012 , Sharma 2014 , and Tritapepe 2009 . For this, Erb 2014 and Leppikangas 2011 observed no significant differences between study groups. All other studies described higher values in the levosimendan intervention group compared to the placebo control group, which were said to be significant in Eriksson 2009 (at end of surgery and at 8 hours after declamping aorta), Lahtinen 2011 (postoperative measurements), Levin 2012 (immediately following administration of the levosimendan loading dose until 48 hours postoperatively) and Tritapepe 2009 (after surgery). Tritapepe 2006 provided IQR data that revealed a higher median cardiac index in the levosimendan group compared to the placebo group after surgery (baseline: 2.3 (IQR 2.0 to 2.6) versus 2.4 (IQR 2.1 to 2.7) mmHg); end of surgery: 2.3 (IQR 2.2 to 2.5) versus 2.1 (IQR 1.9 to 2.3) mmHg; 6 hours after surgery: 2.9 (IQR 2.5 to 3.1) versus 2.4 (IQR 2.3 to 2.8) mmHg; 24 hours after surgery: 3.0 (IQR 2.7 to 3.4) versus 2.7 (IQR 2.3 to 2.8) mmHg).\n\nThere was a difference in mean MAP between the levosimendan intervention group and the placebo control group at 6 hours after surgery as reported by Hu 2020 , Jävelä 2008 , and Kodalli 2013 with ‐4.81 (95% CI ‐6.08 to ‐3.55; 374 participants, 3 studies; low heterogeneity) ( Analysis 7.10 ). However, no evidence of a difference was observed between groups at baseline, end of surgery, 12 hours, and 24 hours after surgery ( Analysis 7.10 ). For instance, Anastasiadis 2016 , Eriksson 2009 , Jävelä 2008 , and Kodalli 2013 reported that the mean difference between groups at baseline was 2.91 (95% CI ‐3.19 to 9.01; 146 participants, 4 studies; moderate heterogeneity). Moreover, three studies, Eriksson 2009 , Hu 2020 , and Jävelä 2008 , reported that the mean difference between groups at end of surgery was ‐2.06 (95% CI ‐6.50 to 2.38; 404 participants, 3 studies; substantial heterogeneity). In addition, Hu 2020 , Jävelä 2008 , and Kodalli 2013 reported that the mean difference between groups at 12 hours after surgery was ‐4.57 (95% CI ‐9.19 to 0.05; 374 participants, 3 studies; moderate heterogeneity). At 12 hours after surgery, five studies found that the mean difference between groups was ‐2.19 (95% CI ‐5.84 to 1.46; 466 participants, 5 studies; moderate heterogeneity) ( Anastasiadis 2016 ; Eriksson 2009 ; Hu 2020 ; Jävelä 2008 ; Kodalli 2013 ). Narrative information on MAP was given by Erb 2014 ; Juhl‐Olsen 2015 ; Leppikangas 2011 ; Sharma 2014 , and Tritapepe 2009 . Whereas Erb 2014 , Juhl‐Olsen 2015 , and Leppikangas 2011 documented no significant difference in MAP between groups during the study period, Tritapepe 2009 stated that after surgery there were significantly higher values of MAP in those treated with levosimendan. Likewise, Sharma 2014 noted that the levosimendan group showed better MAP in both intra‐ and postoperative periods, and that the difference was statistically significant at all time points without providing quantitative data. Tritapepe 2006 provided IQR data that were similar in dimension between study groups at baseline, end of surgery, and 24 hours after surgery (baseline: 72.5 (IQR 65.2 to 77.7) versus 70.0 (IQR 65.8 to 76.5) mmHg); end of surgery: 69.0 (IQR 65.0 to 76.7) versus 68.0 (IQR 65.0 to 71.5) mmHg; 24 hours after surgery: 78.5 (IQR 73.2 to 84.5) versus 74.5 (IQR 70.0 to 80.0) mmHg)). However, at 6 hours after surgery, median MAP was higher in the levosimendan group compared to the placebo control group (77.5 (IQR 72.2 to 79.7) versus 70.00 (IQR 68.0 to 77.0) mmHg).\n\nLittle to no difference was reported in mean PCWP between the levosimendan group and the control group at baseline, end of surgery, 6 hours, and 12 hours after surgery ( Analysis 7.11 ). At baseline, five studies reported the mean difference between groups was 0.11 (95% CI ‐1.02 to 1.24; 196 participants, 5 studies; low heterogeneity) ( Anastasiadis 2016 ; Eriksson 2009 ; Jävelä 2008 ; Kodalli 2013 ; Shah 2014 ). Moreover, Eriksson 2009 , Jävelä 2008 , and Shah 2014 reported that the mean difference between groups at end of surgery was ‐1.63 (95% CI ‐3.85 to 0.58; 134 participants, 3 studies; considerable heterogeneity). At 6 hours after surgery, Jävelä 2008 and Kodalli 2013 reported that the mean difference between groups was 0.31 (95% CI ‐0.82 to 1.44; 54 participants, 2 studies; low heterogeneity). At 12 hours after surgery, three studies found that the mean difference between groups was ‐1.35 (95% CI ‐4.05 to 1.36; 104 participants, 3 studies; considerable heterogeneity) ( Jävelä 2008 ; Kodalli 2013 ; Shah 2014 ). However, there was a difference in mean PCWP between groups at 24 hours after surgery as reported by Anastasiadis 2016 , Eriksson 2009 , Jävelä 2008 , Kodalli 2013 , and Shah 2014 , with ‐1.33 (95% CI ‐2.50 to ‐0.17; 196 participants, 5 studies; moderate heterogeneity) ( Analysis 7.11 ). Tritapepe 2006 provided IQR data that were similar in dimension between study groups at baseline, end of surgery, 6 hours, and 24 hours after surgery (baseline: 14.0 (IQR 12.0 to 15.7) versus 12.5 (IQR 11.2 to 15.7) mmHg); end of surgery: 14.5 (IQR 12.2 to 17.5) versus 15.5 (IQR 13.2 to 17.0) mmHg; 6 hours after surgery: 13.0 (IQR 10.5 to 15.0) versus 14.0 (IQR 11.2 to 15.0) mmHg; 24 hours after surgery: 11.0 (IQR 10.0 to 13.7) versus 13.0 (IQR 11.0 to 14.0) mmHg)). Sharma 2014 narratively reported that there was a significant reduction in mean PCWP in the levosimendan group, which started after the infusion and was sustained postoperatively.\n\nDuration of mechanical ventilation\n\nThe mean duration of mechanical ventilation was reported by Anastasiadis 2016 , Hu 2020 , Kodalli 2013 , Leppikangas 2011 , Sharma 2014 , Tritapepe 2006 , and Tritapepe 2009 with 572 participants. Anastasiadis 2016 reported that the mean duration of mechanical ventilation in the control group was 29.9 ± 54.3 hours. The mean duration of mechanical ventilation in the intervention group receiving levosimendan was 17.80 hours lower (mean difference ‐17.80, 95% CI ‐44.63 to 9.03). Hu 2020 reported that the mean duration of mechanical ventilation in the control group was 157.44 ± 58.56 hours. The mean duration of mechanical ventilation in the intervention group receiving levosimendan was 53.76 hours lower (mean difference ‐53.76, 95% CI ‐63.79 to ‐43.73). Kodalli 2013 observed a mean duration of mechanical ventilation in the control group of 7.1 ± 1.5 hours. The mean duration of mechanical ventilation in the intervention group receiving levosimendan was 0.10 hours lower (mean difference ‐0.10, 95% CI ‐1.33 to 1.13). Leppikangas 2011 found the mean duration of mechanical ventilation in the control group was 5.67 ± 1.47 hours. The mean duration of mechanical ventilation in the intervention group receiving levosimendan was 4.10 hours higher (mean difference 4.10, 95% CI ‐1.76 to 9.96). Sharma 2014 reported that the mean duration of mechanical ventilation in the control group was 37.65 ± 3.48 hours. The mean duration of mechanical ventilation in the intervention group receiving levosimendan was 9.55 hours lower (mean difference ‐9.55, 95% CI ‐11.47 to ‐7.63). Tritapepe 2006 documented a mean duration of mechanical ventilation in the control group of 11 ± 3 hours. The mean duration of mechanical ventilation in the intervention group receiving levosimendan was 1.00 hours lower (mean difference ‐1.00, 95% CI ‐3.40 to 1.40). Tritapepe 2009 reported the mean duration of mechanical ventilation in the control group was 13.6 ± 4.5 hours. The mean duration of mechanical ventilation in the intervention group receiving levosimendan was 2.30 hours lower (mean difference ‐2.30, 95% CI ‐3.72 to ‐0.88). In summary, there was a difference in the mean duration of mechanical ventilation between groups, favouring the levosimendan group (mean difference ‐8.03, 95% CI ‐13.17 to ‐2.90; 572 participants, 7 studies; very low‐certainty evidence; considerable heterogeneity) ( Analysis 7.12 ; Table 2 ). IQR data were reported by Cholley 2017 , Erb 2014 ; Eriksson 2009 , and Juhl‐Olsen 2015 . All but Juhl‐Olsen 2015 observed a lower median duration of mechanical ventilation in the levosimendan group compared to the placebo group ( Cholley 2017 : 17 (IQR 12 to 20) versus 18 (IQR 14 to 20) hours; Erb 2014 : 20 (IQR 16 to 63) versus 45 (IQR 18 to 115) hours; Eriksson 2009 : 21 (IQR 10 to 792) versus 23 (IQR 10 to 580) hours). Juhl‐Olsen 2015 reported a duration of mechanical ventilation of 7.93 (IQR 4.77 to 15.4) hours in the levosimendan group compared with 6.77 (IQR 4.82 to 13.27) hours in the placebo control group.\n\nProportion of weaning failure within 48 hours of extubation\n\nThere were five studies with 1233 participants reporting on the proportion of weaning failure within 48 hours of extubation ( Anastasiadis 2016 ; Eriksson 2009 ; Levin 2012 ; Mehta 2017 ; Sharma 2014 ). Anastasiadis 2016 reported that none out of 16 participants in the levosimendan intervention group had weaning failure within 48 hours of extubation compared to 1 out of 16 in the control group (RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.01 to 7.62). Eriksson 2009 found that 8 out of 30 patients in the levosimendan group had weaning failure within 48 hours of extubation compared to 20 out of 30 in the control group (RR 0.40, 95% CI 0.21 to 0.76). Also, Levin 2012 reported that 3 out of 127 participants in the levosimendan group had weaning failure within 48 hours of extubation compared to 12 out of 125 in the control group (RR 0.25, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.85). In contrast, Mehta 2017 found that 1 out of 428 patients in the levosimendan group had weaning failure within 48 hours of extubation compared to none out of 421 in the control group (RR 2.95, 95% CI 0.12 to 72.24). Sharma 2014 reported that 2 out of 20 participants in the levosimendan group had weaning failure within 48 hours of extubation compared to 4 out of 20 in the control group (RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.10 to 2.43). Altogether, there was a difference in the proportion of weaning failure within 48 hours of extubation between groups, favouring the levosimendan group (RR 0.39, 95% CI 0.23 to 0.67; 1233 participants, 5 studies; low heterogeneity) ( Analysis 7.13 ).\n\nNumber of patients requiring mechanical circulatory support (IABP)\n\nInformation on the number of patients requiring mechanical circulatory support was found in 10 studies with 1881 participants ( Anastasiadis 2016 ; Cholley 2017 ; Erb 2014 ; Eriksson 2009 ; Kodalli 2013 ; Lahtinen 2011 ; Levin 2012 ; Mehta 2017 ; Shah 2014 ; Sharma 2014 ). However, the relative effect was only generated from Anastasiadis 2016 , Cholley 2017 , Erb 2014 , Eriksson 2009 , Lahtinen 2011 , Levin 2012 , Mehta 2017 , Shah 2014 , and Sharma 2014 , while the risk ratio from Kodalli 2013 was not estimable due to no events being observed in either group. Hu 2020 narratively reported a significantly longer IABP support in the placebo control group compared with the levosimendan intervention group without specifying the number of patients in need of this support.\n\nThere were 92 out of 944 participants in the levosimendan group requiring mechanical circulatory support compared to 136 out of 937 in the control group. When levosimendan was compared to the control group, there was a difference in the number of patients requiring mechanical circulatory support and this effect was favourable to levosimendan (RR 0.47, 95% CI 0.24 to 0.91; 1881 participants, 10 studies; low‐certainty evidence; substantial heterogeneity) ( Analysis 7.14 ; Table 2 ).\n\nNumber of patients requiring additional inotropic drugs\n\nNeed for overall additional inotropic drugs was reported by six studies ( Cholley 2017 ; Levin 2012 ; Mehta 2017 ; Shah 2014 ; Tritapepe 2006 ; Tritapepe 2009 ), which found that 338 out of 811 patients required additional inotropic drugs in the intervention group with levosimendan compared to 433 out of 801 patients in the placebo control group. There was a difference in the risk ratio between groups favouring levosimendan (RR 0.49, 95% CI 0.28 to 0.88; 1612 participants, 6 studies; considerable heterogeneity) ( Analysis 7.15 ).\n\nWithin this outcome category, specific inotropic drugs, i.e. epinephrine, norepinephrine, dopamine, dobutamine, enoximone, milrinone, nitroprusside, ephedrine, and phenylephrine were also reported. Except for dobutamine, there was little to no difference in risk ratio between groups. Five studies, Cholley 2017 , Erb 2014 , Eriksson 2009 , Kodalli 2013 , and Lahtinen 2011 , reported that 30 out of 328 patients in the levosimendan group required additional epinephrine compared to 47 out of 330 patients in the control group (RR 0.61, 95% CI 0.26 to 1.45; 658 participants, 5 studies; substantial heterogeneity) ( Analysis 7.16 ). Regarding norepinephrine, Cholley 2017 , Erb 2014 , Eriksson 2009 , Juhl‐Olsen 2015 , Kodalli 2013 , and Lahtinen 2011 reported that 166 out of 338 participants in the levosimendan group received this additional inotropic support compared to 117 out of 340 participants in the control group (RR 1.31, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.71; 678 participants, 6 studies; moderate heterogeneity) ( Analysis 7.17 ). Narratively, both Jävelä 2008 and Leppikangas 2011 stated that the levosimendan group required more norepinephrine compared with the control group. Tritapepe 2009 reported that 9 out of 52 patients in the levosimendan group required additional dopamine compared to 17 out of 50 patients in the control group (RR 0.51, 95% CI 0.25 to 1.03; 102 participants, 1 study; heterogeneity not applicable) ( Analysis 7.18 ). Four studies, Erb 2014 , Juhl‐Olsen 2015 , Lahtinen 2011 , and Tritapepe 2006 , stated that 23 out of 138 patients in the levosimendan group required additional dobutamine compared to 72 out of 139 patients in the control group and there was a difference in the risk ratio between groups favouring levosimendan (RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.22 to 0.50; 277 participants, 4 studies; low heterogeneity) ( Analysis 7.19 ). Erb 2014 reported that 7 out of 17 patients in the levosimendan group required additional enoximone compared to 11 out of 16 patients in the control group (RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.31 to 1.16; 33 participants, 1 study; heterogeneity not applicable) ( Analysis 7.20 ). Regarding milrinone, Eriksson 2009 and Lahtinen 2011 documented that 2 out of 129 participants in the levosimendan group received this additional inotropic support compared to 13 out of 131 participants in the control group (RR 0.22, 95% CI 0.03 to 1.41; 260 participants, 2 studies; low heterogeneity) ( Analysis 7.21 ). Juhl‐Olsen 2015 reported that 1 out of 10 patients in the levosimendan group required additional nitroprusside compared to 6 out of 10 patients in the control group (RR 0.17, 95% CI 0.02 to 1.14; 20 participants, 1 study; heterogeneity not applicable) ( Analysis 7.22 ). Jävelä 2008 narratively noted that the levosimendan group received less nitroprusside postoperatively compared with the control group. Cholley 2017 reported that 53 out of 167 patients in the levosimendan group required additional ephedrine compared to 48 out of 168 patients in the control group (RR 1.11, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.54; 335 participants, 1 study; heterogeneity not applicable) ( Analysis 7.23 ). In addition, Cholley 2017 reported that 34 out of 167 patients in the levosimendan group required additional phenylephrine compared to 24 out of 168 patients in the control group (RR 1.43, 95% CI 0.88 to 2.30; 335 participants, 1 study; heterogeneity not applicable) ( Analysis 7.24 ).\n\nNumber of patients requiring cardiac transplantation, ventricular assist device (VAD) implantation or cardiopulmonary resuscitation\n\nInformation on the number of patients requiring cardiac transplantation or VAD implantation was restricted to Cholley 2017 , Erb 2014 , Kodalli 2013 , and Levin 2012 . However, the relative effect was only generated from Cholley 2017 , Erb 2014 , and Levin 2012 , while the risk ratio from Kodalli 2013 was not estimable due to no events being observed in either group. There were none out of 326 patients in the levosimendan group requiring cardiac transplantation/VAD implantation compared to 8 out of 322 in the control group and the risk ratio between groups differed in this, favouring levosimendan (RR 0.16, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.91; 648 participants, 4 studies; low heterogeneity) ( Analysis 7.25 ).\n\nInformation on the number of patients requiring cardiopulmonary resuscitation was restricted to Kodalli 2013 with 30 participants. However, the relative effect for the outcome was not estimable due to no events being observed in either group ( Analysis 7.26 ).\n\nProportion of renal failure\n\nNine studies reported this outcome ( Anastasiadis 2016 ; Cholley 2017 ; Erb 2014 ; Kodalli 2013 ; Lahtinen 2011 ; Levin 2012 ; Mehta 2017 ; Shah 2014 ; Sharma 2014 ). However, the relative effect was only generated from Anastasiadis 2016 , Cholley 2017 , Erb 2014 , Lahtinen 2011 , Levin 2012 , Mehta 2017 , Shah 2014 , and Sharma 2014 , while the risk ratio from Kodalli 2013 was not estimable due to no events being observed in either group. There were 43 out of 914 patients in the levosimendan group suffering renal failure compared to 61 out of 905 in the control group, with little to no difference in the risk ratio between groups (RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.43 to 1.16; 1819 participants, 9 studies; low heterogeneity) ( Analysis 7.27 ).\n\nQuality of life\n\nOverall, eight studies gave information on quality of life ( Erb 2014 ; Juhl‐Olsen 2015 ; Lahtinen 2011 ; Levin 2012 ; Mehta 2017 ; Shah 2014 ; Sharma 2014 ; Tritapepe 2009 ). Erb 2014 used the EuroQol 5‐D questionnaire and reported that according to this, quality of life was comparable between levosimendan and control groups six months after surgery (levosimendan group: 6.5 ± 2.1 versus placebo group: 7.4 ± 1.2). Similarly, Lahtinen 2011 used EuroQol 5‐D to assess the quality of life status and found that the quality of life was comparable between groups preoperatively. Six months after surgery, both groups had substantially improved quality of life compared to preoperative values with no difference reported between groups (no quantitative data given). Juhl‐Olsen 2015 stated that no patient developed headache or nausea. Levin 2012 narratively pointed out that there were no significant differences in adverse events (hypotension, headache, nausea and vomiting) during the 24‐hour preoperative infusion period between study groups. Mehta 2017 reported on reasons for premature permanent discontinuation of infusion, i.e. hypotension (26 of 428 in levosimendan group versus 21 of 421 in placebo group) and tachycardia or arrhythmia (2 of 428 in levosimendan group versus 3 of 421 in placebo group). Shah 2014 stated that the adverse events occurring during the 24 hours preoperative infusion were hypotension (7 of 25 in levosimendan group versus 2 of 25 in placebo group), need for vasopressors (2 of 25 in levosimendan group versus 1 of 25 in placebo group), headache (3 of 25 in levosimendan group, versus 1 of 25 in placebo group), nausea (2 of 25 in levosimendan group versus 0 of 25 in placebo group), and vomiting (2 of 25 in levosimendan group versus 0 of 25 in placebo group). Sharma 2014 pointed out that the adverse events occurring during the 24 hours preoperative infusion were hypotension (5 of 20 in levosimendan group versus 3 of 20 in placebo group), need for vasopressors (3 of 20 in levosimendan group versus 2 of 20 in placebo group), headache (2 of 20 in levosimendan group versus 1 of 20 in placebo group), and vomiting (1 of 20 in levosimendan group versus 2 of 20 in placebo group). Regarding quality of life, Tritapepe 2009 documented that 4 out of 52 patients in the levosimendan group developed hypotension.\n\nSubgroup analyses\n\nDue to the small number of studies in most comparisons, subgroup analyses were limited to levosimendan.\n\nRegimen of the control group\n\nWe had planned to analyse the influence of the control group regimen (placebo‐controlled versus active control). However, only a minority of the included studies investigated levosimendan compared with an active control, so no interpretable results could be obtained based on the available data. There was only one feasible analysis that addressed the impact of control group regimens on atrial fibrillation, and no subgroup interaction was found ( Analysis 8.1 ).\n\nTiming of the administration\n\nGiven the time points reported in the included studies, it was possible to perform subgroup analyses on all primary endpoints distinguishing between levosimendan administration before surgery (4 to 24 hours in advance) and in the operating room (at induction of anaesthesia, before skin incision or before initiation of the cardiopulmonary bypass machine). Subgroup analyses show evidence of a difference between the placebo group and the levosimendan group favouring levosimendan with respect to 30‐day mortality when the drug was given in the preoperative period (RR 0.30, 95% CI 0.14 to 0.67; Analysis 9.1 ). However, there was little to no difference between the placebo group and the levosimendan group when the drug was given in the operating room (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.60 to 1.41; Analysis 9.1 ). No subgroup interaction was found regarding the incidence of LCOS or adverse events ( Analysis 9.2 ; Analysis 9.3 ; Analysis 9.4 ; Analysis 9.5 ).\n\nAdministration protocol of levosimendan\n\nLevosimendan can be administered with or without an initial bolus. Therefore, subgroup analyses were performed to assess the potential impact of the administration protocol. These analyses revealed no subgroup interaction for any of the primary endpoints investigated (30‐day mortality, LCOS, adverse events) ( Analysis 10.1 ; Analysis 10.2 ; Analysis 10.3 ; Analysis 10.4 ; Analysis 10.5 ).\n\nType of cardiac surgery\n\nWe aimed to analyse the influence of the type of cardiac surgery performed. However, there were too many mixed surgical intervention studies to have any meaningful comparisons.\n\nParticipants with versus without pre‐existing LV dysfunction\n\nWe aimed to analyse the influence of the severity of the participants' disease (with or without pre‐existing LV dysfunction). However, no subgroup analysis was possible since virtually no events were reported in the limited studies that included participants without LV dysfunction.\n\nDiscussion\n\nSummary of main results\n\nThis systematic review comprised 29 RCTs involving 3307 participants. Of these, 24 studies addressed levosimendan and compared its efficacy and safety with dobutamine, milrinone, standard cardiac care, or placebo. Another four studies estimated the efficacy and safety of milrinone compared with placebo; one of these studies was designed as a three‐arm intervention study that also evaluated amrinone. An individual study evaluated dopamine versus placebo.\n\nIn general, confidence in the results of analysed studies was reduced due to relevant risk of bias, imprecision, or inconsistency. Domains of concern encompassed inadequate methods of sequence generation (selection bias) and lack of blinding (performance and detection bias). The majority of trials were small with only a few included participants (high imprecision of results). An acknowledgement of funding by the pharmaceutical industry or missing conflict of interest statements occurred in 19 of 29 trials.\n\nOur meta‐analyses showed that levosimendan may reduce the risk of LCOS and probably reduces all‐cause mortality compared to placebo but not compared to standard cardiac care or milrinone ( Table 1 ; Table 2 ). Subgroup analyses revealed that the beneficial effects of levosimendan were predominantly observed in preoperative drug administration. Our meta‐analyses further indicated that levosimendan compared to placebo, dobutamine, or milrinone but not compared to standard cardiac care may shorten the length of ICU stay and the duration of mechanical ventilation ( Table 1 ; Table 2 ), but the evidence is very uncertain. There was no conclusive evidence on the effect of dopamine compared to placebo on LCOS and duration of mechanical ventilation, or on the effect of milrinone compared to placebo on all‐cause mortality, length of ICU stay, and duration of mechanical ventilation. For all further comparisons, no data on all‐cause mortality, LCOS, length of ICU stay, or duration of mechanical ventilation were available. The risk of adverse events and the number of participants requiring mechanical circulatory support, if reported, did not clearly differ between study groups for all comparisons.\n\nOverall completeness and applicability of evidence\n\nThe available evidence was not sufficient to fully address the objectives of the review. In clinical practice, there are a variety of inotropic drugs. In the identified studies, this diversity was not reflected. A majority of the studies examined levosimendan. An assessment of the efficacy and safety of other inotropic agents was thus not possible or only to a very limited extent. Further limitations related to study size and the availability of relevant outcomes. In most studies, the number of included participants was small. Not all outcomes pre‐specified in the protocol for this review article were reported in all studies, and in some cases, quantitative data were not available. For valid estimation of the efficacy and safety of the prophylactic use of inotropic agents to prevent LCOS and mortality during elective cardiac surgery, it is important to consider relevant influential factors. This comprises the regimen of the control group, the timing and, in the case of levosimendan, the type of inotropic administration, the type of cardiac surgery, and the severity of cardiac disease. However, due to the small number of studies and the lack of quantitative outcome data, the evidence base for the required subgroup analyses was limited. Therefore, the findings of the subgroup analyses, insofar as they were feasible at all, should be viewed with caution.\n\nQuality of the evidence\n\nWe downgraded GRADE certainty assessment of RCT outcomes due to imprecision, risk of bias, and inconsistency. Overall, we assessed the certainty of evidence for our primary outcomes as moderate to low for all‐cause mortality, low to very low for incidence of LCOS, and high to very low for adverse events. With the exception of the comparison of levosimendan versus placebo, the criterion of optimal information size was not met for any of the interventions being evaluated. Accordingly, we downgraded the certainty of all outcomes in these comparisons for imprecision. For all‐cause mortality in the comparison of milrinone versus placebo, there was also imprecision due to methodological heterogeneity. We applied downgrading due to risk of bias to outcomes in the comparisons levosimendan versus milrinone, levosimendan versus standard cardiac care, levosimendan versus placebo, and dopamine versus placebo. We downgraded outcomes in the dopamine versus placebo comparison as reasons for exclusion of study participants related to true outcome. In the other comparisons, we downgraded outcomes due to inadequate methods of sequence generation and/or lack of blinding. For inconsistency, we downgraded the outcomes incidence of LCOS, adverse events: atrial fibrillation, length of ICU stay, and duration of mechanical ventilation in the comparisons of levosimendan versus dobutamine, levosimendan versus standard cardiac care, and levosimendan versus placebo.\n\nPotential biases in the review process\n\nOur review has limitations primarily related to a lack of data availability. Although we searched key databases and study registries in collaboration with Cochrane Heart, we cannot exclude the possibility that we may have missed relevant publications. We contacted corresponding authors of the included studies to obtain missing quantitative outcome data, if possible. However, we received an adequate response only in the case of one study ( Baysal 2014 ). Bias may have resulted merely from the relatively small total number of studies available and participants included. For most of the outcomes, there were too few studies to create a funnel plot, so we were not able to assess the possibility of publication bias. The limited evidence base also had a negative impact on the feasibility of relevant subgroup analyses.\n\nAgreements and disagreements with other studies or reviews\n\nThe prophylactic use of inotropic agents in adult patients undergoing cardiac surgery to prevent LCOS and associated mortality and morbidity has been evaluated in two meta‐analyses so far ( Elbadawi 2018 ; Wang 2019a ). Both review articles focused on the potential benefit of levosimendan. Meta‐analyses on the safety and efficacy of strictly prophylactic administration of other inotropic agents are not available.\n\nElbadawi 2018 included participants undergoing cardiac surgery (CABG and/or valve surgery) who received levosimendan before, during, or after surgery for prophylactic reasons. Only RCTs were included. There were no restrictions regarding the type of control group. A total of 16 studies with 2273 participants were analysed. No statistically significant differences were found between levosimendan and control groups with regard to 30‐day mortality, incidence of perioperative myocardial infarction or postoperative cerebrovascular events, or the need for additional inotropic agents, postoperative dialysis or mechanical assist devices. In contrast, the levosimendan group showed a significant reduction in the duration of ventilation time and ICU stay as well as the incidence of postoperative acute kidney disease on the one hand, and a significantly increased incidence of atrial fibrillation on the other. Concerning the primary outcome of the meta‐analysis, 30‐day mortality, a subgroup analysis was performed to examine the potential influence of pre‐existing LV dysfunction (LVEF < 40% versus LVEF > 40%), the regimen of the control group (placebo‐controlled versus active control), and the timing of administration (preoperative versus postoperative). Here, a subgroup interaction was found solely for the regimen of the control group. This suggested that a prophylactic administration of levosimendan was associated with improved 30‐day mortality compared to active control, but not compared to placebo control.\n\nWang 2019a focused on the prophylactic administration of levosimendan compared with any control in adult participants undergoing CABG. Twenty‐one RCTs with 1727 participants were included. The meta‐analysis showed a statistically significant reduction in mortality, the need for IABP and additional inotropic agents, and the incidence of atrial fibrillation, myocardial infarction or renal dysfunction in the levosimendan group compared to the control group. Furthermore, a statistically significant increased incidence of hypotension and associated need for vasoactive medication was found with levosimendan administration. Subgroup analyses showed that the beneficial effects of levosimendan were predominantly observed in isolated on‐pump CABG and preoperative bolus drug administration. Interestingly, the subgroup analysis also indicated that a reduction in mortality with levosimendan was limited to the comparison with placebo control.\n\nOur meta‐analyses showed that levosimendan may reduce the risk of LCOS and and probably reduces associated all‐cause mortality as well as the need for IABP when compared to placebo, but not when compared to standard cardiac care, dobutamine, or milrinone. Our meta‐analyses further indicated that levosimendan compared to placebo, dobutamine, or milrinone but not compared to standard cardiac care may shorten the length of ICU stay and the duration of mechanical ventilation, but the evidence is very uncertain. We did not find a significant effect of levosimendan on the incidence of adverse events or the need for additional inotropic medication. Our data, as do the findings of Elbadawi 2018 and Wang 2019a , provide some indications of the possible efficacy and safety of prophylactic use of levosimendan in elective cardiac surgery. Consistent with Wang 2019a , our subgroup analyses showed that a favourable effect of prophylactic levosimendan on LCOS incidence and mortality was limited to preoperative administration. However, the quality and validity of the data are very poor. Given the limited evidence available, there is an unmet need for large‐scale, well‐designed randomised trials. Notably, future studies of levosimendan should be designed to determine the potential benefit in specific patient groups (with/without left ventricular dysfunction) and surgery types, as well as the optimal administration protocol.\n\nThere are two meta‐analyses in the scientific literature dealing with the prophylactic administration of levosimendan during heart surgery in children due to congenital heart disease ( Hummel 2017 ; Wang 2020 ). Both studies found no effect on mortality rates. However, only a very limited number of RCTs and participants could be included in both reviews, so no firm conclusions were drawn by the study authors.\n\nThere are several meta‐analyses that investigated the safety and efficacy of the inotropic agents milrinone or levosimendan in cardiac surgery, though without distinguishing between prophylactic use and treatment of acute LCOS. Regarding milrinone, all but one meta‐analyses found no effect on mortality rates ( Majure 2013 ; Ren 2020 ; Rong 2019 ; Ushio 2016 ; You 2016 ; Zangrillo 2012 ). Regarding levosimendan, the majority of reviews reported a reduction in mortality rates in the intervention group compared to the control ( Harrison 2013 ; Landoni 2012 ; Lee 2017 ; Ng 2019 ; Oliveros 2019 ; Putzu 2018 ; Qiang 2018 ; Tena 2018 ; Wang 2018 ; Xing 2018 ; Zangrillo 2009 ; Zhou 2018 ). However, several of these meta‐analyses also stressed the limited quality of this evidence. In two meta‐analyses, a trial sequential analysis (TSA) was performed, stating that the effect was not reliable ( Wang 2018 ; Xing 2018 ). In three meta‐analyses, a subgroup analysis regarding the trials' risk of bias was performed. In this analysis, the levosimendan effect was lost if only studies with high quality were included ( Ng 2019 ; Oliveros 2019 ; Putzu 2018 ). According to Zhou 2018 , the publication date could also play a role, since according to their subgroup analysis, the levosimendan effect could only be observed in studies conducted before the year 2015. Most authors of the above‐mentioned review articles thus concluded that there is not enough evidence of high quality to support the systematic use of levosimendan in cardiac surgery. The lack of high‐quality evidence is also evident in the present meta‐analysis. In future, special care should be taken to carefully differentiate the indications for the use of inotropics in cardiac surgery when evaluating them. A valid and meaningful assessment can only be achieved if prophylactic and acute use are considered separately.\n\nAuthors' conclusions\n\nImplications for practice At present, the data regarding whether a (specific) pre‐operative inotropic drug therapy could affect mortality in haemodynamically unstable patients before cardiac surgery is not robust. Most importantly, our meta‐analyses show that levosimendan probably reduces the risk of all‐cause mortality and may reduce low cardiac output state (LCOS) compared to placebo. However, when compared to either standard cardiac care, dobutamine, or milrinone, there was no benefit in regard to all‐cause mortality or LCOS. These data indicate that any of these strategies, including the use of levosimendan, might be similar in performance in pre‐operative treatment. Compared to placebo or even to the other inotropic drugs evaluated, our analyses indicate that levosimendan may shorten the length of intensive care unit (ICU) stay and the duration of mechanical ventilation. Our analysis did not compare combinations of the above‐mentioned treatment modalities and thus does not provide any data on the effects of such combined treatments.\n\nImplications for research Considering the limited evidence derived from the present body of evidence, due to a generally high risk of bias and imprecision because of few events and small numbers of participants and trials, it should be emphasised that there remains a great need for large‐scale, well‐designed randomised controlled trials to precisely decipher different drug, dosing, and timing regimens in order to show significant changes in hard endpoints like mortality or safety. Further prospective studies will be necessary to determine if levosimendan indeed proves to be superior in reducing ventilation time and ICU stay as compared to dopamine, milrinone, or placebo. In addition, the timing and duration of a pre‐operative inotropic drug therapy has to be evaluated in more detail and might hold the potential for further improvement using optimised protocols. Importantly, further analyses will also have to more clearly define which patient subgroups will benefit the most from a pre‐operative inotropic drug therapy and which parameters will be suitable to identify the respective patients. As reported above, there were essential differences in baseline parameters and coexisting therapeutic interventions among the trials. Therefore, better comparability of baseline conditions, especially with regard to haemodynamic parameters and the management of inotropics (i.e. standardised protocols for titration and dosing), is necessary in future controlled, prospective studies.\n\nHistory\n\nProtocol first published: Issue 11, 2020",
