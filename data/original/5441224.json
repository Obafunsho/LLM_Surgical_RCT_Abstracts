  "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: CALGB 140503 is an ongoing multi-center randomized trial assessing whether sub-lobar resection is equivalent to lobectomy for the treatment of stage IA non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) ≤ 2 cm in diameter. The objective of this report is to determine the reasons precluding intra-operative randomization.\n\nMETHODS: From June 15, 2007 to March 22, 2013, 637 patients were preregistered to the trial. Three hundred eighty-nine were successfully randomized (61%) and 248 patients were not randomized (39%). We analyzed the reasons for non-randomization among a subset of the non-randomized patients (208) for which additional data were available.\n\nRESULTS: Of these 208 patients, undiagnosed benign nodules (n=104, 16% of all registered patients) and understaging of NSCLC (n=45, 7% of all registered patients) were the dominant reasons precluding randomization. Granulomas represent one-quarter of the benign nodules. The understaged patients had unsuspected nodal metastases (n=28) or other more advanced NSCLC. The rate of randomization was significantly higher in those patients who had a preoperative biopsy (p<0.001)\n\nCONCLUSIONS: In a carefully monitored cohort of patients with suspected small NSCLC ≤2 cm, a substantial number are misdiagnosed (benign nodules) or understaged. These patients may not have benefited from a thoracic surgical procedure. Preoperative biopsy significantly increased the rate of correct diagnosis. Preoperative biopsy of small suspected NSCLC will reduce the number of non-therapeutic or unnecessary thoracic procedures. Accuracy in preoperative diagnosis is increasingly important as more such small nodules are discovered through lung cancer screening.",
