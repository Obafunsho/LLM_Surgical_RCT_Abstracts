  "full_text": "Case Report\n\nA 68-year-old woman (body surface area 1.33 m 2 , body mass index 16.4 kg/m 2 ) with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia had recurrent heart failure as the result of structural valve deterioration after transcatheter aortic valve replacement (AVR) and severe mitral stenosis. She underwent surgical AVR with transcatheter AVR explant using a size S Perceval sutureless valve (Corcym S.r.l.) and mitral valve replacement with a 27-mm SJM mechanical valve (Abbott Laboratories) during the 177-minute cardiac arrest. Attempts to wean from cardiopulmonary bypass failed as the result of severely impaired biventricular function. After additional left and right coronary artery bypass grafting, weaning from cardiopulmonary bypass was still difficult, so venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VA-ECMO) was placed through the femoral artery and vein. Eleven days later, right ventricular (RV) function was recovered without LV functional recovery, then we planned to convert mechanical support from VA-ECMO to Impella or ec-LVAD; however, there was no optimal Impella or outflow cannula insertion site durable for long-term support. The AscAo was a porcelain aorta; the left subclavian artery was postendovascular treatment; the bilateral axillary arteries and the aortic arch were aneurysmal; and the descending to abdominal aorta was postgraft replacement and thoracic endovascular aortic repair with adherent atheroma ( Figure E1 ). Therefore, we attempted to insert 2 cannulae from the LV apex: one into the LV for inflow and the other from the LV passing through the AV to the AscAo for outflow of the ec-LVAD.\n\nOperative Details\n\nBefore surgery, a 14-mm × 8-mm Y-shaped Dacron Hemashield graft (Getinge) was prepared with a donut-shaped felt cuff sewn around the graft ( Figure 1 , A ). After the chest was reopened, 2 cannulation sites were determined on either side of the LV dimple. Twelve mattress sutures were placed around the dimple and passed through the felt cuff of the graft. Before the sutures were tied down, the LV apex was punctured twice at the planned cannulation sites, and two 0.035-inch guidewires were inserted into the descending aorta. Each end of the wire outside the heart was passed through the leg of the graft ( Figure 1 , B ), and the felt cuff and graft were tied to the LV wall ( Figure 1 , C ). Both ends of the graft leg and wire were tunneled through the left subcostal space ( Figure 1 , D ). A 15-Fr Biomedicus NextGen cannula (Medtronic) was inserted into the graft leg using a medial wire, and the tip of the cannula was placed in the AscAo through the AV. Next, a 21-Fr Biomedicus NextGen cannula was inserted in the same manner using a lateral wire, and the tip of the cannula was placed in the LV just below the MV. All the procedures were performed under fluoroscopic guidance ( Figure 1 , E ). The inflow and outflow cannulae were secured to the graft and skin with multiple ligations and connected to the Biofloat centrifugal pump (Nipro) ( Video 1 ). The ec-LVAD was started at 3750 rpm with an estimated flow of 4.0 L/min. The VA-ECMO was successfully removed 4 days later.\n\nPostoperative computed tomography showed good positioning of the inflow and outflow cannulae in the LV and AscAo ( Figure 2 ). The diastolic pulmonary artery pressure decreased from 25 to 11 mm Hg. Transthoracic echocardiography demonstrated successful LV unloading compared with pre-LVAD images ( Figure E2 , A ). Although mild transvalvular regurgitation was observed along the outflow cannula ( Figure E2 , B ), the pulse pressure was kept low within 5 mm Hg. Unfortunately, the patient died of nonocclusive mesenteric ischemia 19 days after the ec-LVAD implantation before LV functional recovery was achieved. Pathological autopsy revealed no thrombus formation around 2 cannulae in the LV and AV ( Figure E3 ).\n\nDiscussion\n\nWe present a new surgical technique for implanting an ec-LVAD. The advantage of this method is that implantation can be performed using only the apical approach. A similar method of implanting an ec-LVAD from the LV apex using ProtekDuo (LivaNova Plc) has been reported previously. 5 However, ProtekDuo, which has not yet been approved in Japan, was originally designed for RV support and is off-label use for LV support. Although ProtekDuo may become available worldwide for LV support in the future, the method used in this study may also be useful as an alternative option when supplies of ProtekDuo are scarce. This method also has the advantage of allowing the outflow and inflow cannulae can be placed separately in the optimal position. To reduce the risk of bleeding, a Y-graft with a doughnut-shaped felt cuff was pre-prepared and sutured around the cannulation sites, which also has the advantage of allowing removal of the cannulae by ligating the cut end of the graft without reopening the chest, although it was not attempted in this patient. However, the disadvantages include the possibility of aortic regurgitation, LV and leaflet thrombosis, ventricular arrhythmias, and hemodynamic disturbances during withdrawal of the ec-LVAD. Although no thrombus formation was observed in the LV after several weeks of support, the usefulness and feasibility of this method should be investigated in the future by increasing the number of cases and the observation period.\n\nIn conclusion, an ec-LVAD was successfully established by inserting 2 cannulae from the LV apex for the treatment of refractory cardiogenic shock, suggesting that this method may be a useful option for patients in whom a typical outflow cannula insertion site is not available.\n\nConflict of Interest Statement\n\nThe authors reported no conflicts of interest.\n\nThe Journal policy requires editors and reviewers to disclose conflicts of interest and to decline handling or reviewing manuscripts for which they may have a conflict of interest.
