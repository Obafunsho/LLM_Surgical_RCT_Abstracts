  "title": "Optimized Temporary Biventricular Pacing Acutely Improves Intraoperative Cardiac Output After Weaning From Cardiopulmonary Bypass – A Sub-study of a Randomized Clinical Trial",
  "abstract": "Objective: Permanent biventricular pacing benefits patients with heart failure and interventricular conduction delay, but the importance of pacing with and without optimization in patients at risk of low cardiac output after heart surgery is unknown. We hypothesized that pacing parameters independently affect cardiac output. Accordingly, we analyzed aortic flow measured with an electromagnetic flowmeter in patients at risk of low cardiac output, during an ongoing randomized clinical trial of biventricular pacing (n=11) vs. standard of care (n=9).\n\nMethods: A sub-study was conducted in all 20 patients, in both groups, with stable pacing after coronary artery bypass grafting and/or valve surgery. Ejection fraction averaged 33±15%, QRS duration 116±19 msec. Effects were measured within one hour of the conclusion of cardiopulmonary bypass. Atrioventricular delay (7 settings) and interventricular delay (9 settings) were optimized in random sequence.\n\nResults: Optimization of atrioventricular delay (171±8 msec), at an interventricular delay of 0 msec, increased flow 14% vs. the worst setting (111±11 msec, p < 0.001) and 7% vs. nominal atrioventricular delay (120 msec, p < 0.001). Interventricular delay optimization increased flow 10% vs. the worst setting (p < 0.001) and 5% vs. nominal interventricular delay (0 msec, p < 0.001). Optimized pacing increased cardiac output 13% vs. atrial pacing at matched heart rate (5.5±0.5 vs. 4.9±0.6 L/min; p = 0.003) and 10% vs. sinus rhythm (5.0±0.6 L/min; p = 0.019).\n\nConclusions: Temporary biventricular pacing increases intraoperative cardiac output in patients with left ventricular dysfunction undergoing cardiac surgery. Atrioventricular and interventricular delay optimization maximizes this benefit.",
