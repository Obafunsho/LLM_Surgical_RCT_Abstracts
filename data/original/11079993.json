  "abstract": "Perioperative AKI remains a large burden for patients undergoing major surgery. Further investigations are necessary to help limit the incidence and impact of perioperative AKI. Although perioperative AKI remains an area of intense study, most treatments are supportive in nature. We must improve our understanding of mechanisms contributing to AKI for physicians to prevent and treat AKI more effectively.",
