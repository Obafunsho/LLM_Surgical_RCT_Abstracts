  "title": "Patency of ePTFE Arteriovenous Graft Placements in Hemodialysis Patients: Systematic Literature Review and Meta-Analysis",
  "abstract": "Arteriovenous grafts (AVGs) are an appropriate option for vascular access in certain hemodialysis patients. Expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) has become the dominant material for such grafts, due in part to innovations in graft design and surgical interventions to reduce complications and improve patency rates. Comprehensive evidence syntheses have not been conducted to update AVG performance in an era in which both access choice and ePTFE graft functioning may have changed. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis summarizing outcomes from recent studies of ePTFE AVGs in hemodialysis, following PRISMA standards. Literature searches were conducted in multiple databases to identify observational and interventional studies of AVG patency and infection risk. Primary, primary-assisted, and secondary patency rates were analyzed at 6, 12, 18, and 24 months postplacement. Kaplan–Meier graft survival plots were digitized to recreate individual patient-level data. Patency rates were pooled using a random effects model. We identified 32 studies meeting our selection criteria that were published from 2004 through 2019. A total of 38 study arms of ePTFE grafts were included, representing 3381 AVG accesses placed. The mean primary, primary-assisted, and secondary patency rates at 1 year were 41% (95% CI, 35% to 47%), 46% (95% CI, 41% to 51%), and 70% (95% CI, 64% to 75%), respectively. Mean 24-month patency rates were 28% (95% CI, 22% to 33%), 34% (95% CI, 27% to 41%), and 54% (95% CI, 47% to 61%), respectively. A high degree of heterogeneity across studies was observed. Overall risk of infection was not consistently reported, but among available studies the pooled estimate was 9% per patient-year (95% CI, 6% to 12%). This meta-analysis provides an up-to-date estimate of the performance of ePTFE AVGs, within the context of improved graft designs and improved interventional techniques.",
