  "title": "Kir1.1 and SUR1 are not implicated as subunits of an adenosine triphosphate-sensitive potassium channel involved in diazoxide cardioprotection",
  "abstract": "Objective: The adenosine triphosphate-sensitive potassium channel opener diazoxide mimics ischemic preconditioning and is cardioprotective. Clarification of diazoxide's site and mechanism of action could lead to targeted pharmacologic therapies for patients undergoing cardiac surgery. Several mitochondrial candidate proteins have been investigated as potential adenosine triphosphate-sensitive potassium channel components. Renal outer medullary potassium (Kir1.1) and sulfonylurea sensitive regulatory subunit 1 have been suggested as subunits of a mitochondrial adenosine triphosphate-sensitive potassium channel. We hypothesized that pharmacologic blockade or genetic deletion (knockout) of renal outer medullary potassium and sensitive regulatory subunit 1 would result in loss of diazoxide cardioprotection in models of global ischemia with cardioplegia.\n\nMethods: Myocyte volume and contractility were compared after Tyrode's physiologic solution (20 minutes), stress (hyperkalemic cardioplegia ± diazoxide, ± VU591 (Kir1.1 inhibitor), N = 9 to 23 each, 20 min), and Tyrode's (20 minutes). Isolated mouse (wild-type, sensitive regulatory subunit 1 [−/−], and cardiac knockout renal outer medullary potassium) hearts were given cardioplegia ± diazoxide (N = 9-16 each) before global ischemia (90 minutes) and 30 minutes reperfusion. Left ventricular pressures were compared before and after ischemia.\n\nResults: Stress (cardioplegia) was associated with reduced myocyte contractility that was prevented by diazoxide. Isolated myocytes were not responsive to diazoxide in the presence of VU591. In isolated hearts, diazoxide improved left ventricular function after prolonged ischemia compared with cardioplegia alone in wild-type and knockout (sensitive regulatory subunit 1 [−/−] and cardiac knockout renal outer medullary potassium) mice.\n\nConclusions: Isolated myocyte and heart models may measure independent and separate actions of diazoxide. By definitive genetic deletion, these data indicate that sensitive regulatory subunit 1 and renal outer medullary potassium are not implicated in cardioprotection by diazoxide.",

Animals received humane treatment in abidance with the Principles of Laboratory Animal Care as stated by the National Society for Medical Research and the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. 21 Although both sexes of animals were used in all experiments, subgroup analyses of results by sex were not performed because of the lack of power given the small numbers of animals in each group.\n\nMouse Myocyte Stress Model\n\nMyocyte isolation\n\nWild-type mice (either sex, C57Bl/6J, Jackson Laboratory) underwent rapid cardiectomy with aortic cannulation for extracellular tissue digestion and cellular isolation, using solutions A and B (detailed next), as described previously. 22 The left ventricle was transferred into solution C (detailed next) and gently dispersed. The cells were allowed to sediment by gravity, and serial washings were performed. The typical yield of viable myocytes was 50% to 80% per isolation. Cells were selected for viability using the following criteria: normal rod shape, smooth edges, sharp borders, clear striations, absence of vacuoles or blebbing, and lack of spontaneous beating. Up to 3 myocytes were used per isolation. Myocytes were used in experiments within 4 hours. Investigators were blinded to the test group during each experiment and during data analysis.\n\nSolution A consisted of 116 mmol/L NaCl, 5.36 mmol/L KCI, 0.97 mmol/L Na 2 HPO 4 , 1.47 mmol/L KH 2 PO 4 , 21.10 mmol/L Hepes (N-[2-hydroxyethyl]-piperazine-N′-[4-butanesulfonic acid]), 11.65 mmol/L glucose; 26.50 μmol/L phenol red (Sigma-Aldrich), 3.72 mmol/L MgCl 2 , 4.40 mmol/L NaHCO 3 , essential vitamins (100Χ, 10 mL; Gibco), and amino acids (50Χ, 20 mL; Gibco). Solution B consisted of solution A plus 10 μM CaCl 2 and 1.2 mg/mL collagenase (type 2; Worthington Biochemical; Freehold, NJ). Solution C consisted of solution A plus 5 mg/mL bovine serum albumin (Sigma-Aldrich), 1.25 mg/mL taurine, and 150 μM CaCl 2 .\n\nDZX (7-chloro-3-methyl-1,2,4-benzothiadiazine-1,1-dioxide; Sigma-Aldrich), a mitochondrial K ATP channel opener, was used at a dose (100 μmol/L) shown to be effective in multiple previous studies. 22 , 23 , 24 VU591 (2,2′-oxybis(methylene) bis(5-nitro-1H-benzo[d]imidazole); Sigma-Aldrich, 20 μmol/L for all studies), is a ROMK (Kir1.1) inhibitor. Hyperkalemic cardioplegia (CPG) solution (Plegisol; Pfizer) consisted of 110 mmol/L NaCl, 10 mmol/L NaHCO 3 , 16 mmol/L KCI, 32 mmol/L Mg, and 2.4 mmol/L CaCl 2 , titrated to pH 7.8 with 8.4% NaHCO 3 solution.\n\nExperimental protocol\n\nMyocytes were initially perfused with 37 °C Tyrode's solution (TYR; 130 mmol/L NaCl, 5 mmol/L KCI, 2.5 mmol/L CaCl 2 , 1.2 mmol/L MgSO4, 24 mmol/L NaHCO 3 , 1.75 mmol/L Na 2 HPO 4 , and 10 mmol/L glucose), buffered to a pH of 7.4 for baseline volume and contractility measurements ( Figure 1 , A ). Myocytes were then perfused for 20 minutes with randomly assigned test solution (n = 9-23 each; TYR, TYR + VU591, 9 °C CPG, 9 °C CPG + DZX, 9 °C CPG + VU591, or 9 °C CPG + DZX + VU591). Myocytes were then reexposed to TYR for 20 minutes. The research team was blinded to test group.\n\nThe exposure to CPG in this model is considered myocyte stress (during the test solution period), because it is associated with significant myocyte swelling and reduced contractility that is prevented by diazoxide. 23 DZX was administered with CPG because it has been demonstrated to be cardioprotective (prevent significant myocyte swelling and contractility) only when administered at the onset of stress. 25\n\nMyocyte volume measurement\n\nMyocyte volume was measured as previously described. 22 Isolated myocytes were placed on an inverted microscope stage (model IX51; Olympus). After a 5-minute stabilization, the chamber was perfused (3 mL/min). Chamber temperature was controlled by a water bath system (37 °C; HAAKE; Thermo Electron Karlsruhe, or 9 °C; Polystat; Cole-Parmer). Cell images were displayed on a video monitor using a charge-coupled device camera (IonOptix). Digital images of viable cells were captured using a video frame grabber (Scion) every 5 minutes ( Figure 1 , A ). Relative cell volume change was determined as previously described. 22\n\nMyocyte contractility\n\nMyocyte contractility was measured using a video-based edge detection system (lonOptix) as described previously. 12 , 26 Cells were paced using a field stimulator (MyoPacer; lonOptix), and data were recorded at baseline and at 10 minute and 20 minute intervals after reexposure to Tyrode's solution ( Figure 1 , A ). The following variables were computed using edge-detection software (lonOptix): percentage shortening, peak velocity of shortening, and peak velocity of relengthening. Myocytes that showed less than 7% cell shortening during baseline were excluded.\n\nStatistical analyses\n\nHypothesis testing was conducted with 1-way analysis of variance. P values of pairwise comparisons were adjusted using the Benjamini–Hochberg procedure. Sample size calculations were based on previous work in this model. Studies were designed to detect a 5% ± 4% difference using an α = 0.05 and a power of 0.80. Statistical analyses were done using R version 3.5.2 (R Core Team), and illustrations were created using Prism version 8.0.2 (GraphPad Software).\n\nIsolated Mouse Heart (Langendorff) Model of Global Ischemia\n\nIsolated heart preparation\n\nWild-type mice (C57Bl6/J) were acquired from Jackson Laboratory. The CRISPR/Cas9 strategy for genome editing was used to target ROMK (renal outer medullary potassium) in C57BI6/J mice to create cardiomyocyte-specific knockout for ROMK (ROMK-CKO) mice as previously described. 27 The SUR1(−/−) mice were created by removal of the 1-kbp gene segment containing both promoter and exon 1 sequences of SUR1 gene by re-mediated recombination as previously described. 12 , 28\n\nMice (SUR1(−/−), ROMK-cardiac KO (CKO), or WT C57Bl/J (ROMK-CKO littermate), either sex) underwent rapid cardiectomy as previously described. 8 , 29 The heart was submersed in ice-cold Krebs–Henseleit buffer (KHB) during aortic cannulation. Hearts were perfused in a Langendorff fashion (retrograde via the aorta) with KHB (118.5 mmol/L NaCl, 25.0 mmol/L NaHCO 3 , 3.2 mmol/L KCI, 1.2 mmol/L KH 2 PO 4 , 1.2 mmol/L MgSO 4 , 1.4 CaCl 2 , and 5.5 mmol/L D-glucose). Hearts were excluded if aortic cannulation time exceeded 5 minutes. A balloon (custom made in our laboratory) was introduced into the left ventricle (LV) and connected to a pressure transducer (HP1290 C; ADInstruments) and an amplifier (20-4; Hugo Sachs Elektronik–Harvard Apparatus). Hearts were epicardially paced at 450 bpm and surrounded by a warm (37 °C) water-jacketed beaker. Coronary perfusion pressure was maintained at 80 mm Hg (the zone of autoregulation for coronary vasculature in murine hearts) by Langendorff column height.\n\nExperimental protocol\n\nBalloon volume was adjusted to an end-diastolic pressure (EDP) of 2.5 mm Hg. During a 30-minute baseline period, LV pressure was measured at increasing 1.4-μL balloon volume increments for baseline data collection ( Figure 1 , B ). The LV balloon volume was then returned to the initial volume, and the heart was arrested for 90 minutes using the test solution.\n\nRandomly assigned test solutions included hyperkalemic CPG (Plegisol) (110 mmol/L NaCl, 10 mmol/L NaHCO 3 , 16 mmol/L KCI, 32 mmol/L Mg, and 2.4 mmol/L CaCl 2 , titrated to pH 7.8 with 8.4% NaHCO 3 solution) or CPG + DZX 100 μmol/L (n = 6-9). After 90 minutes of global ischemia, KHB retrograde perfusion and epicardial pacing were resumed. After 30 minutes, LV pressures were recorded at the identical balloon volumes used during the baseline period as previously described. 8 , 14 , 29 Investigators were blinded to the test group during each experiment and during data analysis. DZX was administered before ischemia because it has been demonstrated to be cardioprotective only when administered before stress. 25\n\nData acquisition and analysis\n\nLV end-diastolic pressure (EDP), and LV developed pressure (LVDP) were determined from digitalized data files using LabVIEW 2014 (National Instruments) and compared over a series of identical intracavitary balloon volumes.\n\nCoronary flow rates were measured at baseline and every 5 minutes after reperfusion by an inline N-series flow probe and a T206 flow meter (Transonic Systems) and compared as described previously. 29\n\nStatistical analysis\n\nCoronary flow between groups was examined using repeated measures analysis of variance. Changes in EDP and LVDP by balloon volume and mouse type groups were examined using repeated measures analysis of variance with Huynh-Feldt correction when the assumption of sphericity was violated. The results of these analyses provided the main effect of balloon volume (regardless of group), the main effect of mouse type groups (collapsed across balloon volumes), and the interaction of balloon volume and group to indicate if the pattern of results over different balloon volumes differed for each group. Pairwise comparisons between the groups at individual balloon volumes were conducted using independent-samples t tests. Sample size calculations were based on previous work in this model. Studies were designed to detect a 5% ± 4% difference using an α = 0.05 and a power of 0.80. Analyses were conducted with IBM SPSS Statistics, Version 28.0 (IBM Corp).\n\nResults\n\nMyocyte Volume\n\nMyocyte volume over time is shown in Figure 2 . Similar to previous results, stress (hyperkalemic cardioplegia) was associated with myocyte swelling that was prevented by DZX ( Figure 2 , A ). Of note, VU591 (ROMK inhibitor) alone prevented myocyte swelling when added to CPG ( P < .05 CPG + VU591 vs CPG). However, VU591 added to CPG + DZX was associated with loss of cardioprotective benefit of either compound alone ( P < .05 CPG + DZX + VU591 vs CPG + DZX) ( Figure 2 , B ).\n\nMyocyte Contractility\n\nMyocyte contractility after test solution is shown in Figure 3 . Similar to previous results, myocytes demonstrated significant decline in all 3 parameters of contractility after exposure to CPG ( P < .05 CPG vs TYR). The addition of DZX to CPG prevented this reduction in contractility ( P < .05 CPG + DZX vs CPG). VU591 alone improved contractility when added to both CPG ( P < .05 CPG + VU591 vs CPG) and TYR ( P < .05 TYR + VU591 vs TYR), respectively. The observed benefit of DZX was lost in the presence of VU591 ( P < .05 CPG + DZX + VU591 vs CPG + DZX).\n\nCoronary Flow in Isolated Hearts After Global Ischemia\n\nCoronary flow was not different between groups at any time point (baseline or during reperfusion) ( Figure E1 ).\n\nLeft Ventricular Developed Pressure and End-Diastolic Pressure After Global Ischemia\n\nResponse to diazoxide in cardiac knockut ROMK (Kir1.1) mice\n\nWT hearts (from CKO ROMK littermates) had the expected response to DZX as they exhibited improved LVDP and reduced EDP after prolonged global ischemia ( P < .05 DZX + CPG vs CPG) ( Figure 4 ). Unexpectedly, ROMK CKO hearts were also responsive to DZX and had improved LVDP and reduced EDP after ischemia ( P < .05 DZX + CPG vs CPG) ( Figure 5 ).\n\nResponse to diazoxide in SUR1(−/−) mice\n\nSUR1(−/−) mice were also responsive to DZX and had improved LVDP and reduced EDP after ischemia when DZX was added to CPG, versus CPG alone ( P < .05 DZX + CPG vs CPG) ( Figure 6 ).\n\nDiscussion\n\nWe have attempted to systematically identify K ATP channel components involved in DZX cardioprotection, towards the goal of developing a K ATP targeted therapeutic drug to provide myocardial protection during cardiac surgery. 12 , 13 , 14 , 15 , 16 , 17 , 18 , 19 Although others have suggested alternate mitochondrial proteins encoded by CCDC51 and ABCB8 genes, with unknown function, as proteins involved in a mitochondrial K ATP channel, 30 we have focused on the investigation of known or potential K ATP channel subunits. 12 , 13 , 14 , 15 , 16 , 17 , 18 , 19\n\nOur previous work in isolated mouse myocytes and via a proteomic analysis of the mitochondrial membrane, has implicated the SUR1 and ROMK proteins as potential subunits of a cardioprotective mitochondrial K ATP channel sensitive to diazoxide. 12 , 14 , 18 , 20 However, by using genetically engineered mouse hearts in the current study, we have definitively demonstrated that the SUR1 and ROMK subunits are not implicated in cardioprotection mediated by diazoxide.\n\nBoth the putatively ROMK1-specific inhibitor VU591 and the KO of SUR1 led to loss of DZX protection against experimental CPG in isolated myocytes. 12 , 14 This apparent discrepancy in results between the myocyte model and the Langendorff model may be related to unique mechanisms at separate locations or to the known non-specificity of pharmacologic K ATP channel inhibitors. 31 We and others have questioned the selectivity and efficacy of K ATP channel inhibitors, as well as variable drug efficacy with different metabolic states. 16 , 18 , 23 , 24 , 26 , 32\n\nNon-K ATP channel mechanisms have also been suggested to underlie the cardioprotection of diazoxide, and we and others have documented that the mechanism is at a nonsarcolemmal location. For example, DZX can inhibit succinate dehydrogenase at high concentrations and inhibitors targeting Complex II can also protect hearts. 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 , 12 , 13 , 33 Inhibition of electron transport chain at Complex II, succinate dehydrogenase, could thus contribute to cardioprotection.\n\nIn previous experiments with mitochondria-targeted S-nitrosylating agent, a cardioprotective effect was noted with mitochondria-targeted S-nitrosylating agent alone with CPG, and this was lost with the addition of DZX. 8 The same phenomenon was noted in the current experiments with Kir1.1 inhibitor VU591 (cardioprotection with VU591 alone that was lost with the addition of DZX). This may suggest an upstream or downstream effect at the mitochondrial level that is vital for DZX action at Complex II (succinate dehydrogenase).\n\nFuture work will be necessary to complete the systematic evaluation of known K ATP channel components and the investigation of non-K ATP channel mechanisms of pharmacologic channel openers to increase the knowledge of the mechanism of action of these drugs. Recognition of differential K ATP channel makeup in different tissues has led to understanding and successful treatment of several human diseases. Neonatal diabetes and congenital hyperinsulinism are effectively treated with K ATP channel inhibitors and K ATP channel openers, respectively. A variety of selective channel openers have been developed to avoid nonselective systemic side effects. 34 The determination of a selective channel opener implicated in myocardial protection would be an exciting and clinically useful tool to exploit the cell's innate cardioprotection for the prevention of myocardial stunning. Such knowledge would facilitate the development of targeted therapies to provide improved cardioprotection during cardiac surgery without unwanted systemic side effects or crossover drug–induced pathology. 35 Therapy targeted to specific mechanisms could potentially provide safe strategies to mimic ischemic preconditioning, reduce myocardial stunning, and minimize injury following the global ischemia that accompanies cardiac surgery ( Figure 7 ).\n\nStudy Limitations\n\nWe have implied that pharmacologic channel blockade may be nonspecific and that genetic deletion or modification is definitive. However, it is important to note that genetic deletion may be associated with unexpected biological effects due to channel compensation in individual animals. 35\n\nConclusions\n\nThe prolonged global ischemia model 29 used was designed to mimic the clinical situation of global arrest during cardiac surgery. Caution should be taken in extrapolation of these results to the clinical situation. The prolonged global ischemia model is longer than the traditional mouse infarct model; therefore, measuring infarct size is not informative in this model, and the functional results noted cannot be correlated with structural myocardial changes.\n\nConflict of Interest Statement\n\nThe authors reported no conflicts of interest.\n\nThe Journal policy requires editors and reviewers to disclose conflicts of interest and to decline handling or reviewing manuscripts for which they may have a conflict of interest.
