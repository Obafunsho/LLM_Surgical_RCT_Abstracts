  "title": "Superior Cavopulmonary Anastomosis Timing and Outcomes in Infants with Single Ventricle",
  "abstract": "Objectives: We sought to identify factors associated with timing and surgical outcomes of the superior cavopulmonary anastomosis (SCPA).\n\nMethods: The Pediatric Heart Network’s Infant Single Ventricle trial database identified participants who underwent SCPA. Factors potentially associated with age at SCPA, length of stay (LOS) and death by 14 months of age were evaluated. Factors included subject demographics, cardiac anatomy, measures from neonatal hospitalization and pre-SCPA visit, adverse events, echocardiographic variables, intraoperative variables, SCPA type, and the number of concurrent cardiac surgical procedures. Age at SCPA was analyzed by Cox proportional hazards regression. Natural log LOS was analyzed by multiple linear regression.\n\nResults: SCPA was performed in 193 subjects at 5.2 (IQR 4.2, 6.2) months of age and weight of 5.9 (IQR 5.3, 6.6) kg. Median LOS was 7 days (IQR 6, 10). There were 3 deaths and 1 transplant during SCPA hospitalization and 3 deaths and 3 transplants between discharge and 14 months of age. Age at SCPA was associated with center and interstage adverse events. Longer LOS was associated with younger age and greater case complexity. SCPA type, valve regurgitation, ventricular ejection fraction and ventricular end-diastolic pressure were not independently associated with age at SCPA or LOS.\n\nConclusions: Greater case complexity and more frequent interstage adverse events are associated with earlier age at SCPA. Significant variation in age at SCPA among centers, independent of subject factors, highlights a lack of consensus regarding optimal timing. Factors associated with LOS may offer insights for improving pre-SCPA care and surgical outcome.",
