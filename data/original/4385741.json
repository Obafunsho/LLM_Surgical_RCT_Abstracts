  "title": "Implication of Right Ventricular Dysfunction on Long-term Outcome in Patients with Ischemic Cardiomyopathy Undergoing Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting with or without Surgical Ventricular Reconstruction",
  "abstract": "Background: Whether right ventricular (RV) dysfunction affects clinical outcome after CABG with or without SVR is still unknown. Thus, the aim of the study was to assess the impact of RV dysfunction on clinical outcome in patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) with or without surgical ventricular reconstruction (SVR).\n\nMethods and Results: Of 1,000 STICH patients with coronary artery disease (CAD), left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction (EF) ≤35% and anterior dysfunction randomized to undergo CABG or CABG + SVR, baseline RV function could be assessed by echocardiography in 866 patients. Patients were followed for a median of 48 months. All-cause mortality or cardiovascular hospitalization was the primary endpoint, and all-cause mortality alone was a secondary endpoint. RV dysfunction was mild in 102 (12%) patients and moderate or severe in 78 (9%) patients. Moderate to severe RV dysfunction was associated with larger LV, lower EF, more severe mitral regurgitation, higher filling pressure, and higher pulmonary artery systolic pressure (all p<0.0001) compared to normal or mildly reduced RV function. A significant interaction between RV dysfunction and treatment allocation was observed. Patients with moderate or severe RV dysfunction who received CABG + SVR had significantly worse outcomes compared to patients who received CABG alone on both the primary (HR=1.86; CI=1.06–3.26; p=0.028) and the secondary endpoint (HR=3.37; CI=1.36–8.37; p=0.005). After adjusting for all other prognostic clinical factors, the interaction remained significant with respect to all-cause mortality (p=0.022).\n\nConclusion: Adding SVR to CABG may worsen long-term survival in ischemic cardiomyopathy patients with moderate to severe RV dysfunction, which reflects advanced LV remodeling.",
