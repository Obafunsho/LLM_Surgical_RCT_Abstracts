  "title": "Effects of Increased Cardiopulmonary Bypass Pump Flow on Renal Filtration, Perfusion, Oxygenation, and Tubular Injury in Cardiac Surgical Patients: A Randomized Controlled Trial",
  "abstract": "Background:: Cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) is associated with impaired renal oxygenation and acute kidney injury. The authors investigated whether an amount higher than their standard blood flow during CPB could improve renal blood flow, the oxygen demand–supply relationship, and function and attenuate tubular injury.\n\nMethods:: After ethical approval and informed consent, 36 adult patients undergoing cardiac surgery received either high flow (2.9 l · min –1 · m –2 , n = 19) or standard flow (2.4 l · min –1 · m –2 , n = 17) during CPB in this randomized, nonblinded, parallell-arm study. Systemic hemodynamics and renal variables were measured before and during CPB. Glomerular filtration rate was measured by infusion clearance of iohexol and renal blood flow by infusion clearance of para-aminohippuric acid, corrected for renal extraction of para-aminohippuric acid, using a renal vein catheter. Renal oxygen demand–supply relationship was estimated from renal oxygen extraction and tubular injury assessed by urinary N -acetyl-β- d -glucosaminidase.\n\nResults:: During CPB, high flow led to a larger increase in systemic oxygen delivery (100 [95% CI, 60 to 141] vs. 31 [1.9 to 65] ml · min –1 · m –2 ]; between-group P < 0.001; effect size Cohen’s dz , 0.59) and target mean arterial pressure was maintained at a lower norepinephrine dose (0.03 [–0.01 to 0.06] µg · kg –1 · min –1 ] vs. 0.10 [0.02 to 0.19] µg · kg –1 · min –1 ; P = 0.048; Cohen’s dz , 0.62) compared with standard flow. There were no differences in renal blood flow or oxygen extraction between groups. Glomerular filtration rate increased during high-flow CPB (6.4 [1.9 to 10.9] ml · min –1 · 1.73 m –2 ), but not in the standard-flow group (–2.3 [–10.9 to 6.2] ml · min –1 · 1.73 m –2 ; between-group P = 0.044; Cohen’s dz , 0.66). The peak urinary excretion of N -acetyl-β- d -glucosaminidase was 1.42 (0.87 to 3.6) versus 3.74 (1.5 to 7.7) units/µmol creatinine in the high-flow and standard-flow groups, respectively ( P = 0.049). No perfusion-related adverse events were seen in either group.\n\nConclusions:: A 20% higher-than-standard CPB flow during cardiac surgery improved renal function, whereas no change in renal blood flow or oxygen demand–supply relationship could be detected. Higher CPB flow was associated with a less pronounced tubular injury marker release compared with standard flow.",

  "full_text": "Editor’s Perspective\n\nCardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) enables surgery on a nonbeating heart while maintaining oxygen delivery to the body. Surgery with CPB is associated with complications, including hemolysis, systemic inflammatory response syndrome reaction, coagulopathy, respiratory failure, and acute kidney injury (AKI). 1 , 2 The incidence of AKI is 15 to 30% after cardiac surgery with CPB and 1 to 3% of the patients require renal replacement therapy 1 – 4 associated with a high mortality 3 , 4 and high hospital costs. 5\n\nWhile cardiac surgery-associated AKI probably is multifactorial, renal hypoxia due to reduced renal oxygen delivery during CPB may play an important role. Several studies have addressed the negative renal impact of low systemic oxygen delivery during CPB, resulting in the concept of “goal directed perfusion.” 6 – 9\n\nExperimental studies have shown that medullary perfusion is low, when compared with the cortex, 10 which renders the medulla almost hypoxic, with low levels of tissue P o 2 in the normal situation. Therefore, the renal medulla is particularly sensitive to reduced oxygen delivery and consequent tubular injury, assessed by release of tubular injury markers. 11\n\nThe renal oxygen demand–supply relationship, defined as the ratio of renal oxygen consumption and delivery, has been shown to be impaired in patients undergoing cardiac surgery with normothermic CPB. 8 Such an impairment of renal oxygen demand–supply relationship was associated with hemodilution and renal vasoconstriction, redistributing renal blood flow (RBF) away from the kidneys. 8 This CPB-induced detriment of the renal oxygen demand–supply relationship was associated with increased release of the tubular injury marker, N -acetyl-β- d -glucosaminidase (NAG). 8\n\nIn experimental CPB on sheep, it was shown that CPB was associated with a fall in RBF and a decrease in both cortical and medullary perfusion as well as cortical and medullary oxygenation. 12 , 13 It has also been shown that increasing CPB flow in this model improved RBF and particularly medullary oxygenation. 12 In a previous study by our group, the effects of a period of higher-than-normal CPB flow rates was evaluated in patients undergoing cardiac surgery. 14 We found that the impaired global renal oxygen demand–supply relationship seen during CPB in cardiac surgery patients was ameliorated by higher CPB flow rates. 14 Furthermore, in a recent randomized controlled trial, a CPB flow of 3.0 versus 2.4 l · min –1 · m –2 resulted in increased urine oxygen tension, a surrogate marker of renal medullary oxygenation. 15 In summary, these data suggest that one method of renal protection during CPB would be to use higher flow rates than those traditionally used.\n\nThe aim of this randomized trial was to study the effects of a higher-than-normal CPB flow (2.9 l · min –1 · m –2 ) on renal hemodynamics, glomerular filtration rate, renal oxygen consumption, and renal oxygen demand–supply relationship, as well as the effect on tubular injury compared with our institutional standard CPB flow rate of 2.4 l · min –1 · m –2 in patients undergoing cardiac surgery. Our hypothesis was that in patients receiving a higher-than-normal CPB flow rate, RBF would be higher and the renal oxygen demand–supply relationship would improve and the tubular injury marker release would be attenuated compared with in patients receiving standard flow.\n\nMaterials and Methods\n\nAfter approval from the national Swedish Ethical Review Authority (Dnr:2019-01423), we performed a prospective, nonblinded randomized trial. The study was conducted according to the Helsinki declaration and good clinical practice guidelines and adheres to the CONSORT 2010 guidelines. The study was registered in ClinicalTrials.gov (registration number: 272790; principal investigator, Lukas Lannemyr; date of registration, September 10, 2019).\n\nAdult patients undergoing open cardiac surgery with an expected CPB duration of longer than 60 min were eligible for inclusion. The exclusion criteria were as follows: a body mass index higher than 32 kg/m 2 , surgery for adult congenital heart disease, previous radiologically verified stroke, planned intraoperative hypothermia less than 32°C, an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) using the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration equation of less than 30 ml · min –1 · 1.73 m –2 16 or a left ventricular ejection fraction less than 30%.\n\nThe patients were enrolled and assigned intervention by the first or last author. Written informed consent was obtained from all patients prior to any study procedures. The participating patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio, to receive either our institutional standard blood flow on CPB (2.4 l · min –1 · m –2 ) or high blood flow (2.9 l · min –1 · m –2 ). Randomization was performed by the last author using the Sealed Envelope Ltd (United Kingdom) online randomization tool, stratified by eGFR above or less than 60 ml · min –1 · 1.73 m –2 and left ventricular ejection fraction above or less than 40%.\n\nNeither the investigators nor the clinicians were blinded to the CPB flow rate.\n\nAnesthesia Management\n\nPremedication consisted of oxycodone, 5 to 10 mg depending on patient weight and age. Angiotensin blockers were discontinued on the day of surgery. Induction of anesthesia was initiated with a bolus dose of 5 to 10 µg/kg fentanyl and 1 to 1.5 mg/kg propofol. Rocuronium in a bolus dose (0.6 mg/kg) was used as muscle relaxant. Norepinephrine in bolus doses of 0.01 mg was used to keep the blood pressure stable during the induction of anesthesia.\n\nThe mean arterial pressure (MAP) was measured in the femoral artery. The target MAP before CPB was 65 to 80 mmHg. Before and after CPB, anesthesia was maintained with inhaled sevoflurane and, when needed, extra bolus doses of fentanyl. During CPB, anesthesia was maintained with 2.5 to 4 mg · kg –1 · h –1 propofol infusion.\n\nAfter induction of anesthesia, all patients received an 8F renal vein catheter (Webster Laboratories, USA), inserted through the left or right femoral vein, with guidance from ultrasound and fluoroscopy. Both a 3-lumen central vein catheter and a pulmonary artery catheter (Edwards Lifesciences, USA) were inserted through the right jugular vein guided by ultrasound, and correct placement was verified with x-ray.\n\nCardiopulmonary Bypass\n\nThe CPB machine (Stöckert S5, LivaNova, Germany) was primed with 1,200 ml acetated Ringer’s solution and 10 000 IU heparin. No mannitol or hydroxyethyl starch was used in the CPB prime.\n\nThe patients received a CPB flow rate of 2.4 l · min –1 · m –2 (standard flow) or 2.9 l · min –1 · m –2 (high flow) according to randomization. Cannula sizes, ranging between 20 and 24 French, were selected in accordance with clinical practice and the manufacturer´s recommendation to ensure that the pressure drop did not exceed 80 mmHg for the chosen pump flow rate. Before insertion of the cannulas in the aortic root and inferior ± superior caval vein, a heparin bolus of 350 IU/kg was given, with an activated clotting time goal of more than 480 s before the start of CPB. The target hematocrit during CPB was 25 to 30% and the temperature was kept between 33° to 36°C. Hyperkalemic blood cardioplegia was given as an induction dose of 800 to 1,000 ml with a blood:cardioplegia ratio of 4:1 followed by intermittent bolus doses during the surgery at the surgeon’s request. The target MAP during CPB was 60 to 80 mmHg using a vasopressor (norepinephrine) or a vasodilator (nitroprusside) if needed. The perfusionists maintained a safety fluid level of 150 ml in the venous reservoir. When deemed needed, vacuum on the venous reservoir was used. If there was a need to administer extra volume into the circuit during CPB, the patients received acetated Ringer’s solution or albumin. The use of red blood cells was restricted and given only when necessary to maintain hematocrit level above 24%. During CPB, target arterial P o 2 was 20 kPa and partial pressure of carbon dioxide in arterial blood (pCO 2 ) was kept between 5.0 to 6.0 kPa. After weaning from CPB, the heparin effect was reversed with protamine 0.8 mg per 100 IU heparin, with an activated clotting time goal of less than 130 s.\n\nMeasurements of Systemic Variables\n\nArterial blood pressure, pulmonary arterial pressure, and central venous pressure (CVP) were continuously measured together with heart rate during the experimental procedure. Pulmonary capillary wedge pressure was measured intermittently. Cardiac output (l/min) was measured in triplicate by the thermodilution technique and values were indexed to body surface area (BSA) for cardiac index. Systemic vascular resistance, systemic oxygen delivery, and systemic oxygen consumption were measured and calculated according to standard formulas and were all indexed to BSA.\n\nMeasurements of Renal Variables\n\nAfter the induction of anesthesia, a bolus dose of para-aminohippuric acid (PAH) and iohexol was given, followed by an infusion of PAH and iohexol at a constant rate calculated according to patient size, age, and preoperative creatinine. Arterial and renal vein serum concentrations of PAH and iohexol were measured by a spectrophotometer (Beckman DU 530; Life Science UV/Vis, USA) and by masspectrometry, respectively. Renal blood flow (RBF) was estimated by the infusion clearance of PAH corrected for renal extraction of PAH, divided by (1 – hematocrit), and glomerular filtration rate (GFR) by the infusion clearance of iohexol. For assessment of renal oxygen consumption (RVO 2 ), renal oxygen delivery (RDO 2 ), and renal oxygen extraction (RO 2 Ex), arterial and renal vein oxygen content were measured. Whole-kidney renal oxygen demand–supply relationship was defined as RVO 2 divided by RDO 2 , which is equivalent to RO 2 Ex and calculated as (arterial oxygen content – renal vein oxygen content)/arterial oxygen content. A decrease in RO 2 Ex indicates that RVO 2 has decreased in relation to RDO 2 ( i.e. , renal oxygen demand–supply relationship has improved) and vice versa . Renal perfusion pressue (RPP) was defined as (MAP – CVP). Renal vascular resistance was defined as RPP/RBF. Formulas for the calculation of RBF, GFR, filtration fraction, and other renal variables are described in detail in table 1 . All data on renal variables were normalized to a BSA of 1.73 m 2 .\n\nWe used NAG as the tubular injury marker, as it is produced mainly in the proximal tubules and is not subjected to glomerular filtration due to its high molecular weight. NAG is a sensitive marker of tubular damage, and increased urinary excretion is associated with tubular injury in cardiac surgery. 11 Urine concentration of NAG was measured spectrophotometrically using a commercially available kit (Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Germany). The lower limit of detection was 0.30 U/l and the intra-assay coefficient of variation was 4.6 to 10.4%. To adjust for changes in diuresis during the experimental procedure, the urinary NAG/creatinine ratio was assessed.\n\nExperimental Procedure\n\nSystemic and renal variables were measured and arterial, mixed venous, and renal vein blood samples as well as urine samples were obtained before CPB (baseline) and at 30 and 60 min during CPB. In addition, NAG was measured at 60 min after CPB. Urine was collected in 30-min periods, before and at 30 and 60 min of CPB for calculation of urine flow (ml/min).\n\nStatistical Analysis\n\nThe primary outcome variable of the current study was RBF, and the sample size was calculated using the results of our previous study. 8 To detect a 20% difference in RBF between the two groups, 16 patients in each group were needed at an SD of 115 ml · min –1 · 1.73 m –2 at a two-sided significance level of 0.05 and a power of 80%. To allow for dropouts, we aimed to enroll 20 patients in each group. For all other variables, no corrections for multiple comparisons or a priori power analyses were performed, and these outcomes should therefore be considered as secondary or exploratory. Data are presented as mean ± SD and number (percentage). All group analyses were made according to randomization (high flow vs . standard flow). Group comparisons were made with two-sided independent samples t test for continous data or Fisher’s exact test for categorical data. Group comparisons of data with nonnormal distribution were made with Mann–Whitney U tests. Repeated measures within and between groups before and during CPB were made with linear mixed model analysis. In the linear mixed model, time, group (high flow or standard flow), and their interaction were used as fixed effects, and subjects were used as random effects. The variance components covariance structure was assumed for the random effects. As an estimate of effect size, Cohen’s dz was calculated for variables with a between-group P < 0.05. Change from baseline to mean of 30 and 60 min of CPB was calculated with 95% CI. A P value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. IBM SPSS version 29.0 (USA) was used for all statistical analyses.\n\nResults\n\nPatient inclusion was started in October 2019, and ended in June 2023. The clinical trial profile is shown in figure 1 . In total, 36 patients were analyzed, all according to their originally assigned groups, 17 in the standard flow group and 19 in the high flow group. The trial was temporarily paused during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nBaseline patient characteristics are presented in table 2 . The majority of patients underwent valve surgery, 61% of the total cohort, 58% of them in the standard flow group and 65% in the high flow group. Despite randomization and stratification, mean ± SD preoperative eGFR was lower in the high flow group (73 ± 17 vs . 86 ± 18 ml · min –1 · 1.73 m –2 , P = 0.04). At baseline, cardiac index was 1.92 ± 0.36 and 1.80 ± 0.47 l · min –1 · m –2 in the standard and high flow groups, respectively.\n\nConduct of Cardiopulmonary Bypass\n\nIn all patients, the selected cannula size could be inserted into the aorta without complications. The targeted flow was maintained during CPB in both groups with limited changes and interruptions, e.g. , during aortic cross clamp. The mean ± SD flow (from start of full CPB until start of weaning from CPB) was 2.88 ± 0.07 l · min –1 · m –2 in the high flow group and 2.40 ± 0.02 l · min –1 · m –2 in the standard flow group. The high flow group received more crystalloids (579 ± 568 vs 129 ± 282 ml, P = 0.005) during CPB to maintain venous volume reservoir at a safety level. There were no statistically significant differences in the volume of transfused red blood cells, plasma, or albumin between the groups during the procedure. The hematocrit decreased in both groups during CPB (standard flow group, –0.05 [95% CI, –0.06 to –0.04], P < 0.001, and high flow group, –0.06 [95% CI, –0.07 to –0.05], P < 0.001) with no statistically significant difference between the groups ( P = 0.550).\n\nOne patient in the high flow group developed pulmonary bleeding after manipulation of the pulmonary artery, and another patient in the high flow group developed arrythmias and left ventricle failure after weaning from CPB. None of these adverse events are deemed related to the CPB flow.\n\nEffects of Cardiopulmonary Bypass on Systemic Variables\n\nMAP was maintained within the target range 60 to 80 mmHg during CPB in both groups, but mean (95% CI) MAP decreased compared to baseline in the standard flow group (–7.2 [–13.0 to –1.4] mmHg, P = 0.006), with no statistically significant change in the high flow group (–2.5 [–7.6 to 2.6] mmHg, P = 0.185) with an effect size Cohen’s dz = 0.195, P = 0.038 between groups (table 3 ). Mean norepinephrine infusion rate increased in the standard flow group (0.10 [0.02 to 0.19] µg · kg –1 · min –1 , P = 0.005), with no significant change in the high flow group (0.03 [–0.01 to 0.06] µg · kg –1 · min –1 , P = 0.124), with an effect size Cohen’s dz = 0.617, between-group P = 0.048. The systemic vascular resistance index decreased significantly in both groups during CPB (standard flow group –129 [–216 to –42] dynes*sec · cm –5 · m –2 , P < 0.001, and high flow group –233 [–325 to –141] dynes*sec · cm –5 · m –2 , P < 0.001), with no statistically significant difference between groups ( P = 0.065).\n\nDO 2 I increased during CPB in both the standard flow group (31.4 [1.88 to 64.7] ml · min –1 · m –2 , P = 0.032) and the high flow group (100 [60.1 to 141] ml · min –1 · m –2 , P < 0.001), with an effect size Cohen’s dz = 0.590, P < 0.001 between groups. Mixed venous oxygen saturation increased in the high flow group (4.3% [0.79 to 7.8%], P < 0.001) compared with baseline, with no change in the standard flow group (–0.31% [–5.3 to 4.7%], P = 0.986) with an effect size Cohen’s dz = 0.528, P = 0.032 between groups.\n\nAll systemic variables are presented in table 3 .\n\nEffects of Cardiopulmonary Bypass on Renal Variables\n\nThe primary outcome of the study, renal blood flow (RBF), did not change significantly in either group from baseline to CPB (high flow group +26 [95% CI, –25 to 77] ml · min –1 · 1.73 m –2 , P = 0.392, and standard flow group +1 [–46 to 49] ml · min –1 · 1.73 m –2 , P = 0.980) (table 4 ). RDO 2 decreased in both the standard flow group (–13 [–21 to –5.1] ml · min –1 · m –2 , P < 0.001) and the high flow group (–11 [–18 to –3.5] ml · min –1 · m –2 , P = 0.003) with no statistically significant difference between groups ( P = 0.784).\n\nBaseline GFR was significantly lower in the high flow group ( P < 0.05). During CPB, GFR increased in the high flow group by approximately 10% (6.4 [95% CI, 1.9 to 10.9] ml · min –1 · 1.73 m –2 , P = 0.004), but there was no statistically significant change in the standard flow group (–2.3 [–10.9 to 6.2] ml · min –1 · 1.73 m –2 , P = 0.495), with a Cohen’s dz = 0.66, P = 0.044 between groups, indicating a moderate effect size. Renal sodium filtration increased in the high flow group (0.75 [0.057 to 1.43] mmol/min, P = 0.016), with no statistically significant change in the standard flow group (–0.42 [–1.58 to 0.73] mmol/min, P = 0.445), effect size Cohen’s dz = 0.68, P = 0.017 between groups. In neither of the groups was there a statistically significant change in renal vascular resistance, RVO 2 , RO 2 Ex, or filtration fraction during CPB.\n\nRenal PAH extraction decreased significantly in the high flow group (–0.074 [–0.11 to –0.041], P = 0.002), with no statistically significant change in the standard flow group (–0.045 [–0.10 to 0.014], P = 0.197), between-group P = 0.179.\n\nThere were no significant differences in NAG release between the groups at baseline (median [interquartile range], 0.47 [0.41, 0.83] vs . 0.71 [0.43, 1.15] units/µmol creatinine, P = 0.093) or at 60 min of CPB (1.13 [0.74, 1.8] vs. 1.58 [1.1, 2.5] units/µmol creatinine, P = 0.318) in the high flow and standard flow groups, respectively figure 2 . Peak NAG excretion 60 min after CPB was 62% lower in the high flow group (1.42 [0.87, 3.6] vs. 3.74 [1.5, 7.7] units/µmol creatinine, P = 0.049 between groups).\n\nAll renal variables are presented in table 4 .\n\nDiscussion\n\nIn this randomized clinical trial, we investigated the renal effects of a higher (2.9 l · min –1 · m –2 ) than our standard (2.4 l · min –1 · m –2 ) CPB flow. We were not able to detect a difference in RBF (primary outcome) or in renal oxygen demand–supply relationship between the groups. However, GFR increased during CPB in the high flow group, while there was no statistically significant change in GFR in the standard flow group. This increase in GFR was not accompanied by an increase in RVO 2 . Finally, in the high flow group, tubular injury marker release was less pronounced, as indicated by a 60% lower urinary release of the tubular injury marker NAG after CPB.\n\nIn the high flow group, PAH extraction decreased, which suggests that RBF was redistributed from the cortex to the medulla, as medullary nephrons have a lower PAH extraction compared with cortical nephrons. 17 , 18 Such a redistribution of RBF has been demonstrated during dopamine infusion in man. 17 , 19 Furthermore, this hypothesis is supported by experimental data from an ovine CPB model, where it was shown that there was a positive relation between CPB flow and medullary perfusion when CPB flow was changed within a range of 60 to 100 ml · kg –1 · min –1 . 12\n\nExperimental studies have shown that the major determinant of RVO 2 is tubular sodium reabsorption. 20 We have previously shown in postoperative patients that there is a close correlation between GFR, renal sodium reabsorption, and RVO 2 . 21 – 23 Thus, an increase in GFR will increase sodium filtration, tubular sodium load, and tubular sodium reabsorption, which in turn will increase RVO 2 . In the current study, the increase in GFR in the high flow group was accompanied by an increase in renal sodium filtration and renal sodium reabsorption, which was not seen in the standard flow group. However, in the high flow group, the RVO 2 was uncoupled from GFR, unlike the findings from our previous studies in postcardiac surgery patients. 21 – 23 This could be attributed to a redistribution of RBF to the medulla in the high flow group (see previous paragraph), which together with previous findings of a lower oxygen uptake in medullary nephrons, when compared with cortical nephrons, 24 could explain the lack of an increase in RVO 2 despite the increase in GFR in the high flow group.\n\nWhole-kidney renal oxygen demand–supply relationship (the RVO 2 /RDO 2 ratio) 25 , 26 was assessed by the renal oxygen extraction (RO 2 Ex). A fall in RO 2 Ex indicates improved renal oxygen demand–supply relationship and vice versa . In a previous study, we studied the impact of increasing CPB flows, above standard flow, on the renal oxygen demand–supply relationship in patients undergoing cardiac surgery. 14 In that study, the CPB flow rate was randomly varied in each patient between 2.4, 2.7, and 3.0 l · min –1 · m –2 , each flow level for a duration of 10 min. It was shown that CPB flow rates above standard flow improved the renal oxygen demand–supply relationship, assessed by a fall in RO 2 Ex. 14 These findings were corroborated by Hu et al ., who, in a randomized crossover study, studied the effects of higher-than-normal blood flow during CPB on urine oxygen tension, in patients undergoing cardiac surgery. 15 They found that urine oxygen tension, a surrogate for renal medullary oxygen tension, increased when CPB flow was higher than normal. 15\n\nIn the current study, we could not verify our previous observation. In the high flow group, RO 2 Ex was not lower, i.e. the renal oxygen demand–supply relationship was not enhanced compared with the standard flow group. The major difference between the current and our previous study is that the higher CPB flow rate was maintained for a considerably longer time period (more than 60 min) compared with 10 min in our previous study. 14 One could speculate that renal adaptive autoregulatory mechanisms to the higher CPB flow could play a role in the high flow group by, for example, an activation of the slow tubuloglomerular feedback autoregulatory response induced by the increase in RPP and GFR, which would affect the tone of afferent arterioles, in turn, controlling RBF. 27\n\nOne major observation of the current study was that renal tubular injury marker release was attenuated in the high flow group, as indicated by a less-pronounced urinary release of the tubular injury marker NAG. Previous studies on perioperative release of NAG in cardiac surgery have shown that this biomarker may predict the development of AKI and thus have a prognostic implication. 28 One can only speculate on the potential mechanisms behind such a renoprotective effect in the high flow group. The previously described medullary hypoxia seen during experimental CPB in sheep was reversed by increased pump flow, while cortical P o 2 was not affected by this increase in pump flow. 12 Thus, it seems that increased pump flow during CPB preferentially improves perfusion and oxygenation of the renal medulla, which is particularly sensitive to a reduced oxygen delivery. Such an improvement of medullary oxygenation can be difficult to detect when assessing global renal oxygen extraction using a renal vein catheter, as the renal vein oxygen saturation is heavily affected by the plenteous cortical blood flow and to a lesser extent by the the much lower medullary blood flow. Neither in the current nor in the previous experimental study by Lankadeva et al. was a higher pump flow during CPB associated with a decrease in RO 2 Ex despite the the improved medullary oxygenation, as demonstrated in the latter study. 12\n\nThe norepinephrine dose used to maintain an adequate perfusion pressure was twice as high in the standard flow group compared with the high flow group. One could discuss whether the higher infusion rate of norepineprhrine in the standard flow group had a negative impact on medullary perfusion and oxygenation, contributing to a higher degree of tubular injury marker release in the standard flow group. Experimental studies in septic sheep have shown have shown that norepinephrine treatment is associated with a decrease in medullary oxygen tension and perfusion. 29 , 30 Data from studies on the renal effects of norepinephrine in volunteers and patients are somewhat contradictory. In volunteers it was demonstrated that a pressor dose of norepinephrine to increase MAP by 20 mmHg decreased RBF by 25%. 31 Furthermore, in a recent large observational study in cardiac surgery patients, it was shown that the perioperative use of norepinephrine was associated with postoperative AKI compared with a propensity score–matched control group not receiving norepinephrine. 32 In addition, Hajjar et al . showed in a randomized trial that the incidence of acute renal failure was higher with norepinephrine than with vasopressin when these vasopressors were used to treat vasodilatory shock in cardiac surgery. 33 On the other hand, it was demonstrated in patients with norepinephrine-dependent vasodilatory shock after cardiac surgery 34 and liver transplantation 35 that an increase in the norepinephrine dose to increase MAP from 60 to 75 mmHg if, anything, increased RBF and RDO 2 and improved the renal oxygen demand–supply relationship with no further improvement at higher infusion rates.\n\nOur choice of high flow target, 2.9 l · min –1 · m –2 , was a tradeoff between patient risk and feasibility while still producing a clinically relevant difference compared with our standard flow (2.4 l · min –1 · m –2 ). Higher CPB flows may necessitate larger cannulas and increased oxygenator pressure drops with potential risk for hemolysis 36 and may also induce an exaggerated systemic inflammatory response syndrome response with increased fluid accumulation. This was also the rationale for excluding patients with a body mass index above 32 kg/m 2 . The high flow used in experimental studies, corresponding to a flow up to 3.5 l · min –1 · m –2 on CPB, 12 would probably not be clinically feasible due to the aforementioned limitations.\n\nOne limitation of the current study is that the baseline renal function, both estimated and measured GFR, was lower in the high flow group despite randomization, which might limit the interpretation of the results. Furthermore, the sample size was low and since RBF was the primary outcome variable, the other variables were secondary or explorative and should be interpreted with caution. In addition, the study intervention was not blinded to the clinical team, which may have introduced bias. Last, as this was an investigation focused on the intraoperative renal effects of increased CPB flow, we have limited information on the effects of the intervention on postoperative renal outcome or potential negative effects of a higher-than-standard flow during CPB.\n\nConclusions\n\nDespite a 20% higher-than-standard CPB flow during cardiac surgery, we were not able to detect an increase in renal blood flow. Furthermore, we found no detectable differences between groups in renal oxygen delivery, oxygen consumption, or the oxygen demand–supply relationship. However, a higher-than-standard CPB flow increased GFR and induced a less-pronounced tubular injury marker release, suggesting that a higher-than-normal CPB flow may improve renal function and may be be renoprotective.\n\nResearch Support\n\nThis work was supported by grants from the Swedish State under the agreement between the Swedish government and the county councils, the ALF-agreement (ALFGBG-73450 and 75130), the Swedish Heart and Lung Foundation (No. 20200260), and the Gothenburg Society of Medicine (grants GLS-985241 and 973521).\n\nCompeting Interests\n\nDr. Lannemyr has received consultancy fees from XVIVO Perfusion (Mölndal, Sweden) and CardioRenal Systems (Milford, Massachusetts).
