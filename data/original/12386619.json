Among these, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is the most prevalent and has received increasing attention from the medical community due to its clinical significance [ 1 ]. OSA is characterized by repeated episodes of upper airway obstruction during sleep, resulting in intermittent apnea and hypopnea, and frequent episodes of decreased arterial oxygen saturation. It is typically diagnosed when the apnea–hypopnea index (AHI) is ≥5 (AHI is used to classify OSA severity as follows: mild (5–15 events/hour), moderate (15–30 events/hour), and severe (>30 events/hour). These thresholds are established by the American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) and are widely utilized in clinical practice [ 2 ]) and associated with excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) [ 2 , 3 ]. These events lead to cycles of hypoxemia and hypercapnia, increased sympathetic activity, and activation of the renin−angiotensin−aldosterone system, contributing to adverse metabolic and cardiovascular effects [ 4 ]. Polysomnography (PSG) remains the gold standard for diagnosis [ 5 ], but its limited accessibility has led to increased use of portable diagnostic tools in both research and clinical settings [ 5 , 6 , 7 ].\n\nWith a highly variable prevalence depending on definitions and diagnostic criteria, it is estimated that 1 in 5 adults have at least mild OSA, while 1 in 15 have moderate to severe forms [ 8 ]. In earlier reports, OSA was estimated to affect 2–5% of adults and up to 20% of the elderly population (>70 years) [ 6 ]. However, more recent data from the HypnoLaus study report substantially higher prevalence, with moderate-to-severe OSA affecting ~50% of men and ~20% of women [ 9 ]. OSA prevalence increases with age, body mass index (BMI), and upper airway abnormalities [ 10 , 11 , 12 ]. Despite its high prevalence, OSA is still under-recognized and underdiagnosed. Studies estimate that 50–90% of cases, particularly moderate-to-severe forms, may go undetected, especially in low-resource settings and among high-risk populations such as atrial fibrillation (AF) patients, who often lack symptoms like daytime sleepiness [ 6 , 13 , 14 , 15 ].\n\nUntreated OSA is associated with increased cardiovascular risk, including hypertension, heart failure (HF), stroke, coronary artery disease (CAD), pulmonary hypertension, and arrhythmias [ 5 , 16 , 17 , 18 , 19 , 20 , 21 , 22 ]. It also significantly reduces life expectancy—by as much as 20 years in severe untreated cases [ 7 ]. OSA significantly affects perioperative outcomes and is associated with increased postoperative complications, including readmissions and new-onset AF, particularly after cardiac surgery [ 23 , 24 ].\n\nAF is the most common sustained arrhythmia worldwide, particularly in older adults—more than one-third of patients are aged ≥80 years [ 25 , 26 ]. The global incidence continues to rise, contributing significantly to the socioeconomic burden on healthcare systems [ 25 , 27 ]. In 2010, worldwide prevalence was estimated at 596.2 per 100,000 men and 373.1 per 100,000 women, with projections suggesting a twofold increase by 2060 in the European population aged ≥55 years [ 27 ]. Notably, AF is associated with a fivefold increased risk of stroke and a twofold increased risk of cardiac death [ 26 ]. AF is also the most common arrhythmia found in patients with OSA [ 16 , 28 ], and the two conditions share several risk factors, including hypertension, diabetes, obesity, and structural heart disease [ 26 , 29 ].\n\nSeveral studies have demonstrated a strong bidirectional relationship between OSA and AF [ 14 , 30 , 31 ]. The mechanisms underlying this association are complex and multifactorial and may involve oxidative stress, inflammation, autonomic dysfunction and imbalance, and atrial remodelling [ 24 , 31 , 32 , 33 ]. These pathophysiological changes may contribute to the initiation and worsening of AF in patients with OSA.\n\nThe prevalence of OSA in AF patients varies considerably, with reports ranging between 21 and 82% [ 14 , 16 , 25 , 34 , 35 ]. A recent study using home sleep apnea testing (HSAT) found an OSA prevalence as high as 90% in patients with non-valvular AF [ 36 ]. Approximately 40–50% of patients with AF have coexisting OSA [ 30 , 37 ], and the prevalence of AF increases fourfold in patients with severe OSA [ 16 ].\n\nOSA adversely affects AF treatment outcomes, including response to antiarrhythmic drugs [ 38 ], recurrence after ablation [ 39 , 40 ], and electrical cardioversion [ 41 ]. It is also associated with an increased incidence of postoperative AF following coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) [ 24 ]. While observational studies and meta-analyses support a beneficial effect of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy on reducing AF recurrence [ 42 , 43 , 44 ], recent randomized controlled trials have challenged the protective effect of CPAP, highlighting the need for further research [ 45 ].\n\nGiven this strong interconnection, current guidelines continue to recommend OSA screening in patients with AF, particularly in those with resistant hypertension, obesity or HF, as managing OSA may improve arrhythmia and overall outcomes [ 26 , 29 , 33 ]. These recommendations are grounded in the evidence that arrhythmias such as AF and non-sustained ventricular tachycardia are significantly more likely to occur after a respiratory event than after normal breathing, as shown in analyses from the Sleep Heart Health Study and the DREAM study [ 16 , 28 , 35 ].\n\nTaken together, these findings underscore the critical importance of early and accurate OSA diagnosis in patients with or at risk for AF. Timely recognition may support prevention strategies, inform personalized management, and ultimately improve patient outcomes. In this context, the present systematic review aims to synthesize the most recent data on the prevalence and diagnostic approaches of OSA in AF, providing comprehensive evidence to inform clinical practice and guide future research.\n\n2. Methods\n\nA systematic review was conducted in peer-reviewed databases, including PubMed and Google Scholar, to obtain cohort studies and clinical trials published in English, Portuguese or Spanish between 1 January 2019 and 9 December 2024.\n\nThe literature search was performed using the following keywords: (“Atrial Fibrillation” OR “Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation” OR “Fibrillation”) AND (“Sleep Apnea” OR “Obstructive Sleep Apnea” OR “OSA”). The results were analyzed by two independent reviewers. Non-concordances were resolved by consensus.\n\nData on the selected studies were synthesized into a data extraction sheet developed to comprise relevant information needed for further analysis and sections of this review. The topics of analysis included general study characteristics and the reported prevalence of SDB in AF populations; clinical presentation, including self-reported symptoms and structured assessment tools (e.g., STOP-Bang, ESS, Berlin questionnaire); diagnostic and screening methods for SDB; and echocardiographic, polysomnographic and laboratory findings.\n\nThis systematic review was conducted according to the PRISMA guidelines 2020 ( Table S1 and S2 ).\n\n3. Results\n\n3.1. Search Results\n\nThe search strategy retrieved a total of 67 studies and the PRISMA flowchart of the study selection is presented in Figure 1 . Forty-nine papers were excluded because they were out of scope or not relevant for this review and one because it was a review article. Twenty-one additional references detected in crosschecking searches and reference lists were manually added by the authors due to their significance for the topic of interest. In total, 38 eligible articles were included for qualitative evaluation.\n\n3.2. Study Characteristics\n\nThe temporal distribution of the included studies was as follows: 2019 ( n = 6), 2020 ( n = 10), 2021 ( n = 3), 2022 ( n = 5), 2023 ( n = 10), and 2024 ( n = 4). Sixteen studies were conducted in Europe, followed by eleven studies from the United States. Additional countries represented included Australia ( n = 3), China ( n = 2), Japan ( n = 2), South Korea, Tunisia, Turkey, and Canada. A detailed summary of the included studies is provided in Table 1 .\n\nWith respect to study design, the majority were observational studies ( n = 34), while a minority were randomized controlled trials ( n = 4). Among the observational studies, seventeen were prospective studies, six were retrospective analyses, and seven were cross-sectional studies. Additionally, two studies were classified as quality improvement projects, one focused on the development and validation of a diagnostic model, and one was a matched case–control study.\n\nSample sizes varied considerably across studies, ranging from small (≤100 patients) [ 46 , 59 , 70 ] to moderate-sized cohorts (101–500 patients) [ 60 , 62 , 79 ], and large-scale studies (>500 patients) [ 23 , 52 , 58 , 66 ].\n\n3.3. Study Populations\n\nMost studies included adult patients with a diagnosis of AF, primarily middle-aged to elderly individuals, typically aged between 60 and 75 years. Across the included studies, the mean age of patients was 63.7 years (95% CI, 61.5–65.9 years; range 49.9–78.0 years), with a mean proportion of male participants of 63.2% (95% CI, 59.8–66.7%; range 45.0–80.1%). These participants were commonly recruited from inpatient cardiology units, outpatient clinics, or during assessments for catheter ablation procedures.\n\nThe study populations were diverse and included patients undergoing cardiac surgery—such as CABG or valve replacement—with or without AF, individuals with new-onset AF [ 50 ], and those scheduled for ablation procedures [ 54 , 67 ]. Several studies also involved patients with cardiac implantable electronic devices capable of monitoring SDB [ 7 , 48 ].\n\nWhile some studies specifically excluded individuals with a prior diagnosis of OSA [ 54 , 67 , 71 ], others enrolled patients with OSA confirmed by PSG or identified through validated screening methods [ 59 , 60 ].\n\nFurthermore, specific subgroups were represented, including elderly patients (e.g., Mehawej 2022; mean age ~75 years) [ 63 ] and individuals with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) [ 79 ].\n\n3.4. Methods of Sleep-Disordered Breathing Assessment Across Studies\n\nThere was substantial heterogeneity in the methods used to screen, diagnose, and monitor SDB across the included studies ( Table 1 ). The gold standard in-laboratory PSG was used in several studies for definitive diagnosis [ 7 , 15 , 36 , 46 , 59 ] either alone or alongside other modalities.\n\nAlternative diagnostic approaches included HSAT using devices such as WatchPAT [ 54 , 71 , 74 , 75 ], ApneaLink [ 55 ], and NightOwl [ 69 ], as well as respiratory polygraphy [ 56 , 76 ] and Type 3 sleep studies [ 47 , 61 ].\n\nSome studies specified the duration of the sleep assessment. A single-night study was conducted in several HSAT protocols [ 54 , 65 ], while others extended monitoring to two nights, such as in Traaen 2020 and Hunt 2024 [ 57 , 76 ]. Jensen 2023 [ 69 ] used a four-night HSAT protocol with NightOwl, and Linz 2019 [ 48 ] and Mazza 2020 [ 53 ] used continuous night-to-night SDB tracking via pacemaker-based systems.\n\nIn a subset of studies involving cardiac device recipients, pacemaker-based algorithms such as the sleep apnea monitoring algorithm [ 48 , 52 ] or ApneaScan [ 53 ] were employed to estimate respiratory indices via transthoracic impedance, allowing for long-term or continuous SDB monitoring. Few studies relied on retrospective data sources such as clinical documentation, International Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes, or physician-reported diagnosis for the identification of SDB [ 23 , 49 , 51 , 73 ].\n\nIn terms of screening tools, the STOP-Bang questionnaire was the most frequently used tool [ 63 , 64 , 70 ], often combined with other instruments such as the Berlin questionnaire, Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), or novel models like NABS (Neck circumference, Age, BMI, and Snoring) [ 15 ] and BOSS-GAP [ 67 ].\n\n3.5. Prevalence of Sleep-Disordered Breathing in Atrial Fibrillation Populations\n\nA total of 31 studies reported the prevalence of SDB conditions in patients with AF, as summarized in Table 2 . Of these, 21 studies reported on OSA, seven reported on sleep apnea (SA) without specifying the type, and four assessed SDB more broadly.\n\nSome studies included only patients with a confirmed or assumed diagnosis of SDB, thus not contributing to general prevalence estimates in unselected AF populations. In other studies, all participants had SDB by design or selection [ 46 , 72 , 77 , 79 ]. Vermeer’s 2023 study is ongoing and prevalence data has not yet been reported [ 75 ]. Two studies employed risk stratification tools without diagnostic confirmation: Oster 2022 [ 64 ] found that 53% of patients were at moderate to high risk for OSA (STOP-Bang score ≥ 3), while Rogel 2024 [ 78 ] reported that 25% were at high risk (STOP-Bang score ≥ 5).\n\nPrevalence estimates ranged from 5% to 90%, depending on the specific condition assessed, diagnostic method used (e.g., PSG, screening questionnaires, or device-based monitoring), patient population, and severity thresholds. Despite methodological variability, most studies reporting OSA prevalence found rates above ~60%, underscoring the substantial burden of OSA in AF populations.\n\n3.6. Severity Stratification of Sleep-Disordered Breathing in Atrial Fibrillation Populations\n\nAmong studies reporting OSA severity in AF populations, mild cases ranged from 23% to 75%, moderate from 18% to 50%, and severe from 7% to 48%. Despite some heterogeneity, a consistent pattern of moderate-to-severe disease emerged across studies. Several studies reported relatively balanced distributions across severity categories, suggesting a uniform and substantial disease burden [ 7 , 36 , 46 , 50 , 68 , 70 ]. Others identified higher proportions of severe OSA (approximately 33–48%), particularly among patients with persistent AF or comorbidities like HFpEF [ 58 , 59 , 61 , 79 ]. In contrast, some studies reported a predominance of mild OSA and relatively fewer severe cases [ 55 , 60 , 62 , 71 ]. Hunt 2024 found moderate-to-severe OSA in 42% of patients, underscoring its clinical relevance in AF populations [ 76 ].\n\nIn studies that reported SA without specifying the obstructive type, similar severity patterns were seen. Predominance of mild cases varied, accounting for nearly 44%, moderate cases had a prevalence between 33% and 51%, while severe OSA was observed in 12–31% of cases [ 15 , 54 , 57 , 69 , 74 ]. Moderate-to-severe SA was observed in approximately 42–56% of patients [ 15 , 57 , 69 ]. Higher proportions of severe SA were reported by Mazza 2020 (~80% in pacemaker recipients), highlighting a substantial burden in selected populations [ 53 ].\n\nAmong studies reporting SDB, Kadhim 2024 [ 77 ] identified SDB in approximately 66–86% of patients, and significant SDB (AHI ≥ 15) in approximately 34–54%, while Verhaert 2022 [ 65 ] and Betz 2023 [ 67 ] reported moderate-to-severe SDB in approximately 51–55%, with ~17% classified as severe. Linz 2019 [ 48 ], focusing specifically on device-based detection, found severe SDB in ~32% of patients using pacemaker-derived monitoring [ 48 ].\n\n3.7. Prevalence of Atrial Fibrillation in Populations with Sleep-Related Breathing Disorders\n\nTwelve studies referred to the prevalence of AF among patients with OSA, with reported rates ranging from 2% to 74%, depending on population characteristics and OSA severity. In general, AF prevalence was relatively low in population-based cohorts, ranging from approximately 2.5% in Blanchard 2021 [ 58 ] to 7.3% in Højager 2022 [ 61 ]. Higher prevalences were observed in clinical or selected populations, varying between approximately 18% in Rogel 2024 [ 78 ] and 37% in Rivas 2023 [ 73 ]. Feng 2019 [ 23 ] reported an AF prevalence of approximately 40% in postoperative cardiac surgery patients, while Gonçalves 2019 [ 7 ] documented a 42% AF rate during follow-up in pacemaker recipients. Despite earlier evidence suggesting that OSA increases the risk of AF recurrence following ablation, Hojo 2019 [ 47 ], focusing on recurrence after pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) in patients with pre-existing AF, found no significant association [ 47 ].\n\nHøjager 2022, Holtstrand 2023, and Wei 2024 reported a clear association between increasing OSA severity and higher AF prevalence [ 61 , 68 , 79 ].\n\n3.8. Risk Factors for Sleep-Disordered Breathing in Patients with Atrial Fibrillation\n\nThe clinical characteristics that distinguish patient populations across the included studies are summarized in Table 3 .\n\nFrequently reported and consistent risk factors for SDB in patients with AF included demographic factors, namely male sex [ 23 , 45 , 50 , 51 , 52 , 55 , 56 , 58 , 61 , 62 , 63 , 68 , 71 , 74 ], and older age [ 45 , 47 , 54 , 56 , 61 , 62 , 67 , 68 , 69 , 70 , 71 ], although two studies found more prevalent OSA among younger patients [ 23 , 66 ].\n\nAnthropometric factors such as higher BMI or obesity [ 23 , 47 , 49 , 50 , 54 , 55 , 57 , 58 , 60 , 61 , 62 , 63 , 65 , 67 , 68 , 69 , 70 , 71 , 79 ], as well as larger neck circumference [ 55 , 60 , 69 ] were also identified as significant risk factors.\n\nCardiometabolic comorbidities, such as hypertension [ 23 , 47 , 50 , 54 , 55 , 58 , 60 , 61 , 63 , 65 , 67 , 68 , 69 ], diabetes mellitus [ 23 , 47 , 51 , 58 , 61 , 62 , 63 , 77 ], history of thromboembolic events [ 67 , 68 , 69 , 77 ], cardiovascular disease [ 51 , 52 , 65 , 68 ], renal disease or failure [ 23 , 63 ], dyslipidemia, metabolic syndrome, and elevated HbA1c were also reported as relevant factors associated with OSA [ 61 , 67 ].\n\nAF-related characteristics were also commonly associated with OSA [ 36 , 60 , 62 , 69 , 71 , 77 ]. Longer AF duration (greater than two years) was associated with OSA [ 36 , 57 ], as a higher CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc score [ 50 , 60 , 65 , 67 , 69 , 71 , 77 ].\n\nEchocardiographic findings included increased left atrial size (diameter or volume) in several studies [ 15 , 60 , 77 , 79 ]. In contrast, Latif 2022 reported a smaller left atrial diameter in SA patients [ 62 ]. Regarding left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), results were mixed: Latif 2022 [ 62 ] found a lower LVEF in SA patients, while Jensen 2023 [ 69 ] found a higher LVEF among those with moderate-to-severe SA. In contrast, Hojo 2019 and Hunt 2024 found no significant differences in LVEF between OSA and non-OSA groups [ 47 , 76 ]. Additionally, Wei 2024 reported other structural cardiac changes associated with OSAHS and AF, including increased dimensions of the right ventricle, right atrium, and the right ventricular outflow tract [ 79 ].\n\n3.9. Symptom Evaluation Scores for Sleep-Disordered Breathing\n\nThe ESS was extensively used to assess daytime sleepiness [ 7 , 15 , 36 , 50 , 55 , 57 , 58 , 60 , 61 , 68 , 71 , 74 , 76 , 77 ]. Mean ESS scores ranged from 5.5 to 11 across studies. While most studies did not find significant differences between groups, Holtstrand, 2023 [ 68 ] observed increasing ESS scores with greater OSA severity ( Table 3 ).\n\nThe STOP-Bang questionnaire was also a commonly used tool to screen for SDB risk [ 15 , 50 , 54 , 55 , 57 , 60 , 64 , 68 , 71 ], with several studies reporting an increasing proportion of positive STOP-Bang results across OSA, SA or SDB severity levels [ 55 , 57 , 60 , 67 , 71 ].\n\nThe Berlin Questionnaire was used less consistently [ 36 , 50 , 57 , 60 ]. In two studies, more frequent high-risk classifications were found for OSA patients [ 57 , 60 ]. In addition, Starkey 2020 stratified symptom scores—such as STOP-Bang, ESS, NoSAS (Neck, Obesity, Snoring, Age, Sex), and snoring—across OSA severity categories [ 55 ]. Although no statistical comparisons were reported, the data showed an apparent upward trend in STOP-Bang and NoSAS scores with increasing OSA severity, as well as higher snoring prevalence in OSA groups.\n\nSome studies did not report any data on self-reported symptoms related to OSA, SA, or SDB [ 59 , 62 , 65 , 75 , 79 ].\n\n3.10. Self-Reported Symptoms of Sleep-Disordered Breathing\n\nSnoring was one of the most reported symptoms across studies, with prevalence typically ranging from 60% to over 90% in patients with SDB and increasing with disease severity ( Table 3 ). This symptom was assessed either by direct patient questioning or structured questionnaires. In several studies, snoring prevalence differed significantly between groups. Snoring was reported in 40–90% of OSA patients versus 0–60% of non-OSA [ 36 , 60 , 67 ]. By contrast, Gonçalves 2019 and Lin 2023 found no statistical differences in snoring between OSA patients and non-OSA patients [ 7 , 70 ].\n\nWitnessed apneas, often reported by bed partners or via questionnaires, were documented in several studies [ 7 , 54 , 57 , 64 , 67 , 70 ]. The reported rates of observed apneas varied across studies, but moderate-to-severe SDB groups showed a higher prevalence compared to controls or those with mild disease. Traaen 2020, observed that apneas were present in approximately 12% (no SA), 18% (mild SA), 37% (moderate SA), and 44% of cases (severe SA), with p < 0.001 [ 57 ]. In Betz 2023, 34% of patients with moderate-to-severe SDB reported witnessed apneas, compared to only 10–17% in mild or no SDB ( p = 0.003) [ 58 ] By contrast, three studies found no significant differences between groups [ 7 , 54 , 70 ].\n\nGeneral symptoms such as tiredness, fatigue, or EDS were reported differently across studies. Most studies assessed EDS using the ESS, while others evaluated fatigue through symptom checklists or other questionnaires. Among studies using ESS, higher scores were observed in patients with OSA, SA or SDB, but these differences were not statistically significant [ 36 , 60 , 77 ]. In Holtstrand 2023, although mean ESS scores increased significantly with OSA severity ( p < 0.001), the proportion of patients with EDS (ESS ≥ 11) remained similar across groups, and no p -value was reported for that comparison [ 68 ]. In parallel, fatigue or tiredness was also reported based on patient self-report, without statistical significance between groups [ 36 , 54 , 70 ]. In Oster 2022, 71% of patients in the intervention group reported fatigue, though no control comparison was available [ 64 ].\n\n3.11. Laboratory, ECG, Echocardiographic and Polysomnographic Findings\n\nAHI, Respiratory Disturbance Index (RDI), or peripheral AHI (pAHI) were the most consistently reported objective markers across studies ( Table 4 ) [ 15 , 36 , 47 , 50 , 52 , 53 , 56 , 58 , 60 , 61 , 62 , 65 , 68 , 69 , 70 , 71 , 72 , 76 , 77 , 80 ]. As expected, these indices were significantly higher in patients with OSA or with greater disease severity [ 47 , 60 , 68 , 69 , 77 ]. These indices were often stratified by clinical or demographic variables such as sex, BMI/obesity, hypertension status, or pacemaker-derived respiratory data [ 50 , 52 , 53 ].\n\nThe Oxygen Desaturation Index (ODI), measured at 3% or 4% thresholds, was another commonly used marker of SDB severity. Not surprisingly, ODI values were found to be higher in patients with SDB [ 58 , 60 , 65 , 68 , 69 , 71 , 76 ].\n\nOxygenation metrics, particularly those derived from peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO 2 ), were often used to characterize the severity of nocturnal hypoxemia across studies. These included nadir SpO 2 , mean SpO 2 , and time spent below 90% saturation. Minimum SpO 2 values were consistently lower in patients with SDB, varying between 79 and 81% in OSA vs. 84–92% in non-OSA [ 58 , 65 , 69 ]. In Holtstrand 2023, mean SpO 2 also declined progressively with increasing OSA severity (95.9% in no OSA to 93.0% in severe OSA, p < 0.001) [ 68 ]. In addition, several studies assessed the cumulative burden of hypoxemia. Mills 2023 reported that time spent with SpO 2 < 90% increased from 0.03 min in patients without OSA to 8.16 min in those with moderate-to-severe OSA [ 71 ]. Verhaert 2022 found a median time < 90% of 0 min in none/mild SDB and 7.0 min in severe SDB ( p < 0.01) [ 65 ]. In Blanchard 2021, the proportion of time with SpO 2 < 90% rose from 1% in patients without AF to 4% in those with incident AF ( p < 0.0001) [ 58 ].\n\nBiomarkers were less reported across the included studies and showed variable associations with SDB. B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) and N-terminal pro-BNP were evaluated in Hojo 2019, Hunt 2024, and Wei 2024 [ 47 , 76 , 79 ]. Among these, only Wei 2024 demonstrated a significant stepwise increase in BNP levels corresponding with AF severity in OSAHS patients [ 79 ]. In contrast, Hojo 2019 reported no significant differences in BNP between non- and untreated OSA groups [ 47 ]. Creatinine levels were also assessed, with inconsistent findings [ 47 , 70 , 76 ].\n\nHemoglobin-related measures were reported in Mehawej 2022, Højager 2022, and Hunt 2024 [ 61 , 63 , 76 ]. Total hemoglobin was significantly higher in high-risk OSA patients based on STOP-Bang [ 63 ] and a progressive increase in HbA1c levels with increasing OSA severity was reported [ 61 ].\n\nAlso, visfatin, an inflammatory marker, was evaluated in Szymańska 2020, showing a positive correlation between plasma concentration and OSA severity [ 56 ].\n\nAutonomic function measures, though rarely reported across the included studies, were detailed in Blanchard 2021 [ 58 ]. This study assessed heart rate variability parameters derived from nocturnal oximetry and found significant alterations in patients with incident AF and OSA. Specifically, those with incident AF had higher root mean square of successive differences and standard deviation of normal-to-normal intervals, showing increased overall variability, and a lower low-frequency to high-frequency ratio, suggesting parasympathetic predominance or reduced sympathetic modulation.\n\n4. Discussion\n\n4.1. Overview\n\nGlobally, an estimated 730 million individuals are affected by OSA [ 81 ]. Despite its high global burden, OSA is often an underrecognized condition, presenting with or without symptoms, and associated with substantial cardiovascular and neurocognitive morbidity [ 82 ]. OSA is characterized by recurrent episodes of nocturnal hypoxemia, hypercapnia, and autonomic activation, triggering systemic inflammation and oxidative stress. These mechanisms contribute to atrial remodelling and fibrosis, providing a pathophysiological substrate for the development and persistence of AF [ 83 ].\n\nThis systematic review synthesizes evidence on the prevalence and diagnosis of OSA in AF patients. Our review confirms the high prevalence of OSA in AF populations but also shows substantial methodological heterogeneity. This is reflected in the wide range of reported OSA prevalence, highlighting the need for consistent definitions and standardized diagnostic strategies.\n\n4.2. Heterogeneity in Study Populations and Methodological Designs\n\nBased on 38 studies published between 2019 and 2024, this review captures a growing global interest in the AF–OSA connection and the emerging diagnostic challenges in cardiology and sleep medicine, with significant contributions from Europe, North America, and Asia, and a predominance of observational studies. Sample sizes varied across studies, ranging from small cohorts to large-scale studies. Smaller studies typically focused on validating screening tools, while larger ones examined risk factors, outcomes, or prevalence of SDB and AF on a broader scale. Most studies included middle-aged to elderly AF patients (mean age ~64 years, ~63% male), often recruited during cardiology evaluations or ablation workups. Study populations were heterogeneous, including patients undergoing cardiac surgery, device recipients, and subgroups such as the elderly or those with HFpEF, which contributed to variability in the findings.\n\n4.3. Diagnostic Approaches and Screening Tools\n\nStudies included in this review employed a range of diagnostic methods, from gold-standard PSG to simplified ambulatory sleep studies, device-based monitoring, and screening questionnaires. Some studies relied on ICD codes or clinical diagnoses without formal testing, likely capturing only severe cases and introducing misclassification bias [ 84 ].\n\nScreening tools such as STOP-Bang were widely used across studies, often alongside the ESS and the Berlin questionnaire. Although inherently subjective and lacking specificity when used alone, they offer practical value in busy clinical settings, but their accuracy is limited, particularly in minimally symptomatic AF patients [ 70 , 77 ]. Nonetheless, their use in systematic screening approaches may help find high-risk individuals for further evaluation.\n\nMany studies relied on HSAT devices like WatchPAT or Level 3 monitors, rather than full PSG, the diagnostic gold standard. While HSAT offers advantages in cost and accessibility [ 85 ], it may lack accuracy in patients with comorbidities such as AF and may underestimate disease severity compared to PSG [ 74 ]. Inadequate stratification by severity and inconsistent AHI thresholds further contribute to this variability [ 86 , 87 , 88 , 89 ]. There was also a marked heterogeneity in the duration of sleep monitoring —ranging from a single night to multiple-night recordings. This variability likely affects diagnostic yield and may account for some of the inconsistencies in prevalence estimates. Linz et al. (2019) [ 48 ] proved that sleep apnea severity can vary significantly from night to night, suggesting that single-night testing may underestimate disease burden in some patients. Sousa et al., 2020 [ 90 ] emphasized the importance of considering how many nights should be assessed, as OSA severity fluctuates nightly [ 70 , 77 ].\n\nThese factors contribute to the broad range of reported prevalence estimates and highlight the importance of using standardized and sufficiently robust diagnostic and screening protocols in AF populations to ensure consistent classification, improve comparability across studies, and guide appropriate treatment decisions. Device-based monitoring, including pacemaker-derived respiratory data, represents a promising diagnostic avenue, particularly in patients already implanted with cardiac rhythm devices.\n\n4.4. Underdiagnosis of OSA in AF Populations\n\nA significant finding is the underdiagnosis of OSA in AF patients, which has been previously reported by other authors [ 91 ]. This is multifactorial, stemming from a general lack of awareness, the frequent absence of classic OSA symptoms, such as excessive daytime sleepiness—a presentation often referred to as the “non-sleepy” clinical phenotype common among cardiovascular patients [ 1 , 14 , 92 , 93 ]—and the limitations of relying on subjective screening tools alone [ 14 , 80 ]. In line with this, Lin 2023 [ 70 ] identified three major barriers to diagnosis and treatment of OSA in AF patients: (1) the lack of standardized and clinically validated predictors of OSA; (2) the lack of screening tools tailored to cardiovascular patients; and (3) the insufficient implementation and acceptance of PSG, despite its status as the diagnostic gold standard.\n\nTraditional diagnostic criteria may miss a large subset of patients with significant disease burden, as many individuals with AF have few or non-classic OSA symptoms of loud snoring or excessive daytime sleepiness, leading to missed opportunities for diagnosis and treatment. This low symptom burden also reduces clinical suspicion among physicians. Compounding this challenge, the absence of a standardized diagnostic algorithm tailored to AF populations contributes to substantial heterogeneity in clinical practice—as seen across the studies reviewed—and likely plays a key role in persistent underdiagnosis. These factors reinforce the importance of objective testing, even in asymptomatic individuals, and the urgent need to establish evidence-based diagnostic pathways for this patient group.\n\nCommon symptoms, including snoring, unrefreshing sleep, fatigue, nocturia, and witnessed apneas, were inconsistently reported. These symptoms often lacked diagnostic value in this population, making early recognition of OSA in AF patients particularly challenging [ 1 , 14 , 70 , 90 ].\n\nSeveral studies confirm that structured questionnaires like STOP-Bang, the ESS and the Berlin questionnaire, perform poorly in this population, and that newer models—such as the NABS score—may offer better predictive accuracy [ 15 , 92 ]. Nevertheless, they can serve as useful first-line options when incorporated into structured diagnostic pathways and supported by objective assessment methods [ 14 ]. Sousa et al. 2023 [ 92 ] suggested incorporating the STOP-Bang score into electronic health record systems to automate risk stratification and prompt timely referrals.\n\nAnother critical yet underexplored factor contributing to underdiagnosis is the duration of diagnostic monitoring. Most home-based assessments are limited to a single night, despite evidence showing substantial night-to-night variability in SA severity, particularly in patients with cardiovascular disease [ 48 , 57 , 76 ]. While multi-night recordings or continuous monitoring may increase diagnostic accuracy, their feasibility remains limited in routine practice. Therefore, there is a pressing need to develop and validate diagnostic methods that are both accurate and practical, ideally capable of reliably detecting clinically significant OSA in a single-night test.\n\nMoreover, the limited accuracy of HSAT in AF patients, combined with low physician awareness and reluctance to undergo full PSG, further contributes to underdiagnosis [ 14 , 70 ].\n\nThese barriers highlight the need for AF-specific screening tools and initiative-taking diagnostic strategies, even in asymptomatic individuals, and support a broader conclusion: no screening questionnaire has proven ideal in the general population—and even less so in AF patients, who tend to be minimally symptomatic.\n\n4.5. Prevalence Estimates\n\nOur results showed considerable variability, with prevalence rates ranging from as low as 2% in population-based samples to as high as 74% in clinical subgroups. Across the reviewed literature, the prevalence of OSA in patients with AF was remarkably high, often exceeding 60% in studies that used objective diagnostic criteria such as PSG. Reported rates ranged from ~5% to 90%, reflecting methodological heterogeneity. Still, findings are broadly consistent with prior estimates suggesting sleep apnea affects ~50% of AF patients [ 37 ].\n\nHowever, several studies relied on retrospective data sources such as ICD codes, clinical documentation, or physician-reported diagnoses, which may introduce diagnostic variability and misclassification bias, particularly where formal sleep testing was not systematically applied. Additionally, some studies included only patients with a confirmed or presumed diagnosis of sleep-disordered breathing, limiting their utility for estimating prevalence in unselected AF populations. As a result, data on OSA prevalence in the general AF population remain limited, partly due to the retrospective nature of some studies and the focus on selected, often symptomatic cohorts.\n\nA consistent observation across studies was the high burden of moderate-to-severe OSA, particularly in patients with persistent AF or those undergoing rhythm control interventions such as catheter ablation or cardiac surgery. For context, prior reviews in the general population have reported OSA prevalence ranging from 9% to 38%, rising to approximately 49% in individuals aged ≥ 65 years [ 12 ], underscoring the amplified burden of OSA among patients with AF.\n\nThe inverse relationship—AF prevalence in OSA populations—was also examined, albeit in fewer studies. Multiple studies demonstrated that increasing OSA burden is associated with a higher prevalence of AF, supporting the concept of a severity-dependent risk of atrial arrhythmogenesis. In fact, available evidence supports a positive correlation between OSA severity and AF risk, burden, progression, and recurrence post-ablation [ 27 , 31 , 94 , 95 ].\n\n4.6. Risk Factors and Clinical Correlates\n\nOSA and AF share common risk factors [ 96 , 97 ], and both result in a significant reduction in quality of life [ 82 ]. Consistent with the published literature, risk factors for SDB in AF patients included male sex, older age, higher BMI, and cardiometabolic comorbidities such as hypertension, diabetes, and metabolic syndrome [ 82 , 98 , 99 , 100 , 101 ]. In addition to general cardiometabolic risk factors, several studies reported AF-specific characteristics associated with SDB [ 102 , 103 ]. Longer AF duration—particularly over two years—and higher CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc scores were linked to increased likelihood of OSA, suggesting that arrhythmia burden may be a relevant clinical marker for targeted screening [ 36 , 104 ]. Echocardiographic findings also showed inconsistency across studies: while some reported larger left atrial dimensions in patients with OSA, others described variable results in LVEF and right heart measurements, such as right atrial or right ventricular enlargement [ 62 , 79 ]. These discrepancies underscore the need for standardized reporting and further investigation into structural cardiac correlates of SDB in AF populations.\n\n4.7. Clinical and Research Implications\n\nGiven the high prevalence of OSA in AF patients and the potential for improved outcomes with treatment, the underdiagnosis of moderate-to-severe OSA has significant clinical consequences [ 105 ], including increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality [ 106 ], and a higher risk of AF recurrence post-ablation [ 107 ].\n\nIntegrating structured pathways for sleep-disordered breathing screening in arrhythmia units is warranted. Sousa et al., 2023 [ 92 ] proposes a clinical pathway with multidisciplinary approach to implement SDB diagnosis in AF patients. Symptom-based screening limitations support the need for objective tests like PSG even in asymptomatic patients. A low threshold for objective testing, such as PSG, should be considered, even in the absence of sleepiness or snoring.\n\nCurrent guidelines recommend routine OSA screening in patients with AF, particularly in those with resistant hypertension, obesity, or heart failure [ 33 ], as managing OSA may improve arrhythmia and overall outcomes [ 14 ]. Despite these recommendations, routine implementation remains inconsistent. Gupta 2022 supports the idea that all patients with AF [ 101 ] should be screened for OSA, regardless of the presence of other risk factors [ 101 ]. Given the high burden of undiagnosed OSA in AF and its adverse impact on arrhythmia recurrence and cardiovascular outcomes, structured screening and diagnostic protocols should be prioritized. Interdisciplinary models involving sleep and cardiology services may improve detection, access to therapy, and long-term outcomes.\n\n4.8. Study Limitations\n\nThis review benefits from a comprehensive and up-to-date evidence base, encompassing 38 studies from diverse geographic regions. However, several limitations must be acknowledged.\n\nThe search strategy was limited to specific languages (English, Portuguese and Spanish) and selected databases, which might have excluded relevant studies and introduced bias.\n\nMarked heterogeneity in study designs, diagnostic methods, patient populations and sample sizes precluded quantitative synthesis and limited the comparability of results, which may affect the interpretation of overall findings.\n\nConsidering specifically the diagnostic methods, the approaches ranged from PSG to home sleep tests, screening questionnaires, and device-based algorithms. These tools differ in diagnostic accuracy, which may influence the reported prevalence rates. Additionally, some studies included in the review used only screening tools (e.g., STOP-Bang) without confirmatory testing, which may introduce misclassification bias and reduce diagnostic certainty.\n\nPotential publication bias may have influenced these findings. Most included studies were observational and cross-sectional, which limits conclusions about causality [ 25 ] or long-term outcomes of OSA in atrial fibrillation populations. In addition, many studies lacked detailed sex- and ethnicity-specific analyses, constraining the generalizability of results.\n\nAlthough this was a systematic review, the absence of a meta-analysis prevents pooled prevalence estimates or subgroup analyses, which would have strengthened our results. However, the heterogeneity of settings and results did not allow this analysis.\n\nLarge, prospective studies using PSG-confirmed OSA definitions are needed to better delineate prevalence and clinical impact. Randomized controlled trials assessing the effect of OSA therapy on AF outcomes are also warranted. Furthermore, validated AF-specific screening models are essential to enhance diagnostic accuracy [ 100 ]. Marulanda-Londoño 2017 suggest exploring reciprocal screening strategies between AF and OSA [ 108 ].\n\n4.9. Unexpected Findings and Research Gaps\n\nSome studies included in this review reported higher OSA prevalence among younger AF patients. This finding, while unexpected, underscores the importance of considering OSA in younger individuals with AF, regardless of traditional risk factors.\n\nThe lack of a consistent association between EDS and OSA severity in some studies suggests that symptom-based screening alone may not be sufficient for identifying all AF patients with clinically significant OSA.\n\nThe observation that OSA did not affect AF recurrence post-ablation in some studies highlights the complex interplay between these conditions and the need for further research to elucidate the mechanisms involved, namely atrial arrhythmogenesis in OSA, focusing on structural, electrical, and autonomic properties of the atria [ 47 , 97 , 108 ].\n\nSeveral key research gaps remain. Large, prospective studies using full PSG are needed to accurately define the epidemiology and clinical implications of OSA in AF populations [ 109 ]. Efforts should focus on developing and validating AF-specific screening tools to enhance early recognition and individualized risk stratification, improving the efficiency and accuracy of OSA diagnosis in this population. Finally, randomized controlled trials evaluating the impact of OSA diagnosis and treatment on AF outcomes, such as AF recurrence, and cardiovascular outcomes, such as stroke, and mortality, are essential to guide clinical practice [ 110 ]. Sousa et al., 2020 suggests a multidisciplinary work to provide a better understanding of the correlation between cardiac biomarkers and polysomnographic features [ 90 ].\n\nFurthermore, although a few studies investigated biomarkers such as BNP, visfatin, hemoglobin, and creatinine, the findings were inconsistent and often underreported. This limited and heterogeneous use of biochemical and cardiac markers represents an additional research gap. Further studies should explore inflammatory, oxidative stress, neurohormonal, and fibrosis-related biomarkers to improve risk stratification and support more personalized diagnostic strategies in AF patients with suspected OSA [ 97 , 111 , 112 ].\n\n4.10. Future Directions and Research Priorities\n\nIn summary, this review underscores the high prevalence and diagnostic challenges of OSA in AF patients. The variability in prevalence estimates highlights the need for standardized diagnostic approaches, including the development and validation of a diagnostic algorithm, with a validated screening tool and a confirmatory testing, particularly the use of PSG. Integrating routine OSA screening into AF management protocols is essential, especially in high-risk individuals, by applying uniform inclusion criteria such as comorbidity profiles, age ranges and gender. Further research should focus on conducting large-scale trials with stablished methodological guidelines specifically for prevalence or diagnostic studies in obstructive sleep apnea, similar to the PRISMA framework, to reduce the heterogeneity observed across study designs included in this review.\n\n5. Conclusions\n\nOSA is highly prevalent among patients with AF, yet it remains significantly underdiagnosed due to limited symptom presentation, low clinical suspicion, and suboptimal use of diagnostic tools. The current body of evidence consistently demonstrates that moderate-to-severe OSA is common in AF populations and may adversely impact arrhythmia burden, treatment success, and cardiovascular outcomes.\n\nThis systematic review confirms the substantial variability in prevalence estimates, driven by methodological differences across studies, including diagnostic criteria, assessment modalities, and population characteristics. Despite these differences, the findings strongly support the integration of structured and objective OSA screening into routine AF care, even for asymptomatic individuals. Screening tools such as STOP-Bang may be useful when embedded into electronic health records, but they must be complemented by definitive diagnostic testing—ideally polysomnography—to avoid missed diagnoses.\n\nGiven the shared risk factors and overlapping pathophysiological mechanisms between OSA and AF, identifying and managing OSA in AF patients may offer an opportunity to reduce arrhythmia recurrence, optimize cardiovascular care, and improve long-term prognosis. However, the lack of universally accepted AF-specific screening pathways, coupled with inconsistent evidence from recent randomized controlled trials, highlights the need for further research. Future studies should prioritize large, prospective cohorts using standardized PSG-based definitions and evaluate the impact of OSA treatment on hard outcomes, such as stroke, mortality, and AF recurrence.\n\nUltimately, multidisciplinary collaboration between cardiology and sleep medicine will be essential to overcome current diagnostic barriers, personalize management strategies, and address the persistent gaps in evidence that limit current practice.",
