  "title": "Making House Calls Increases Living Donor Inquiries and Evaluations for Blacks on the Kidney Transplant Waiting List",
  "abstract": "Background: Blacks receive live donor kidney transplantation (LDKT) less often than patients of all other races. We evaluated the effectiveness of educational interventions in removing barriers to LDKT for blacks.\n\nMethods: Patients were randomized to three interventions in which health educator(s) delivered an intervention to (a) the patient and his/her guests in the patient’s home (House Calls, HC n=54), (b) clusters of patients and their guests in the transplant center (Group-Based, GB n=49), (c) the individual patient alone in the transplant center (Individual Counseling, IC n=49).\n\nResults: At the 2-year endpoint, 15% (8), 8% (4), and 6% (3) of HC, GB, and IC patients, respectively, received LDKT (p=0.30). HC patients were more likely than GB and IC patients to have at least one donor inquiry (82% vs. 61% vs. 47%, p=0.001) and evaluation (65% vs. 39% vs. 27%, p<0.001). HC patients also were more likely to have higher knowledge, fewer concerns, and higher willingness to talk to others about donation 6 weeks post- intervention.\n\nConclusions: These findings underscore the importance of including the patient’s social network in LDKT education and the potential of the HC intervention to reduce racial disparity in LDKT rates.",
