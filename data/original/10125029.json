  "title": "Endothelial glycocalyx in retina, hyperglycemia, and diabetic retinopathy",
  "abstract": "The endothelial glycocalyx (EG) is a meshlike network present on the apical surface of the endothelium. Membrane-bound proteoglycans, the major backbone molecules of the EG, consist of glycosaminoglycans attached to core proteins. In addition to maintaining the integrity of the endothelial barrier, the EG regulates inflammation and perfusion and acts as a mechanosensor. The loss of the EG can cause endothelial dysfunction and drive the progression of vascular diseases including diabetic retinopathy. Therefore, the EG presents a novel therapeutic target for treatment of vascular complications. In this review article, we provide an overview of the structure and function of the EG in the retina. Our particular focus is on hyperglycemia-induced perturbations in the glycocalyx structure in the retina, potential underlying mechanisms, and clinical trials studying protective treatments against degradation of the EG.",
