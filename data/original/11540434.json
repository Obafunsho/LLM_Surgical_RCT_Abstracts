  "title": "Antibiotic-Impregnated Ventriculoperitoneal Shunts Decrease Bacterial Shunt Infection: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:: Antibiotic-impregnated shunts seem to be beneficial in preventing bacterial infections and decreasing mortality by effectively inhibiting microbial growth in the shunt system and reducing the risk of shunt-associated infections. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of antibiotic-impregnated shunt catheters (AISC) in reducing the incidence of bacterial shunt infection in patients with hydrocephalus.\n\nMETHODS:: The protocol was registered on PROSPERO. A meta-analysis was conducted by searching 3 databases (PubMed, Scopus, CENTRAL) for relevant randomized controlled trials and observational studies. We included all studies published until November 2022 in any language. The primary outcome was the rate of bacterial infections, whereas the rate of shunt failure was our secondary endpoint. Odds ratios (OR) with 95% CI were calculated using a random-effects model.\n\nRESULTS:: A total of 27 articles with 27 266 shunt operations were included in this study. The results indicated that using AISC is significantly associated with reduction in infections (OR = 0.42; 95% CI: 0.33-0.54). Regarding shunt failure, there was a tendency in favor of AISC use (OR = 0.73; 95% CI: 0.51-1.06).\n\nCONCLUSION:: Our study provided evidence that AISC is significantly associated with the reduction in the rate of bacterial ventriculoperitoneal-shunt infection. In addition, there was a tendency toward AISC to decrease shunt failure compared with the standard shunt.",

Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and observational cohort studies were included. Studies with <10 cases or without a control group were excluded.\n\nInformation Sources\n\nOur systematic search was conducted in 4 main databases: MEDLINE (through PubMed), Scopus, Embase, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) from the inception on the 22nd November 2022. Publications in all languages were included. In addition, a backward and a forward citation search was conducted after completion of the full-text selection to identify other potentially relevant publications.\n\nSearch Strategy\n\nOur search key consists of 3 domains: ventriculoperitoneal-shunt and infection and prophylaxis/treatment domain. For the detailed search strategy, see Supplemental Digital Content 2 ( http://links.lww.com/NEU/E271 ).\n\nScreening and Selection\n\nAfter conducting a thorough systematic search, the articles were imported into a reference management tool (EndNote 20.1, Clarivate). Automatic and manual processes were used to remove duplicate articles based on overlapping publication years, authors, and titles. Two reviewers independently conducted screening and selection, initially focusing on title and abstract, and subsequently on full-text evaluation to ensure eligibility criteria were met. Cohen kappa coefficient was calculated at both stages of selection to assess inter-reviewer reliability.\n\nData Extraction\n\nThe data extraction process involved collecting information on the first author's name, year of publication, the age range of participants, number of participants (antibiotic-impregnated shunt/conventional shunt group), study design, follow-up time, and outcomes such as infection, shunt removal, and direct cost. Data were collected by the first author and one co-author, who independently reviewed the relevant articles and recorded the information in a standard data collection form. Any disagreements regarding extracted data were resolved through discussion with a third reviewer.\n\nRisk of Bias Assessment and Quality of Evidence\n\nTwo independent authors performed the risk of bias assessment using the “Risk of Bias In Non-randomized Studies–of Interventions” (ROBINS-I) 28 and “Risk of bias tool for Randomized Trials” (Rob2) tool. 29\n\nThe ROBINS-I tool contains 7 items. Each item was rated as “serious”, “moderate”, or “low” risk according to information provided in each study. It also contains an overall score. The Rob2 tool contains 5 items. The items were rated as “high”, “low”, “some concerns”, or “no information”. This tool also has an overall rating.\n\nIn our study, we followed the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation methodology to assess the reliability of our findings. We used the GRADEpro software for this purpose. Key considerations for evaluating evidence quality included study design, risk of bias, consistency, indirectness, and precision. 30\n\nData Synthesis and Statistical Analysis\n\nThe minimum number of studies was planned to be 3 for performing this meta-analysis. As we assumed considerable between-study heterogeneity, a random-effects model was used in all cases to pool effect sizes.\n\nOdds ratios (OR) with s were used as effect size measures. The total number of patients and those with the event of interest in each group, respectively, were extracted directly or calculated where percentages were given. Pooling was performed using the Mantel-Haenszel method (without continuity correction). 31 , 32 To estimate the heterogeneity variance measure (tau squared), the Paule-Mandel method 33 was used. The CI of tau squared was determined by the Q profile method. 34 The Hartung-Knapp method 35 , 36 was used/applied to account for uncertainty in between-study heterogeneity. Heterogeneity was assessed by Higgins and Thompson 37 I 2 statistics. The results were considered statistically significant if the CI did not contain the null result (ie, OR = 1). Findings were summarized in forest plots. Where it was applicable, we reported the prediction interval (the expected range of effects of future studies). The statistical analysis was conducted with the R software using the meta and metafor package.\n\nModel parameters, and potential outlier publications, were explored using different influence measures and plots (leave-one-out analysis for change in fitted values, Baujat diagnostic 38 values and plots). Small study publication bias was assessed by the modified Egger test 39 and with a visual inspection of funnel plots. Subgroup analyses were performed based on study design (RCT-s and non–RCT-s) and age (adults and pediatric population). Furthermore, we performed a subgroup analysis for participants both below and above the age of one year. We also analyzed the rate of shunt failure and cost and care.\n\nRESULTS\n\nSearch and Selection\n\nAltogether, 10 306 studies were identified by our search key through the 3 main databases. In total, 6038 articles remained for the title and abstract selection after duplicate removal. A total of 55 studies were eligible for full-text selection. The article selection process is presented in the PRISMA flowchart (Figure 1 ).\n\nBasic Characteristics of Included Studies\n\nFour RCT and 23 observational cohort studies were included in our analysis. At total of 17 records were from Europe, 3 from Africa, 2 from North America, 2 from Asia, and 2 from Australia. In total, 27 265 patients were included in the analysis. The main characteristics of the enrolled studies are summarized in Supplemental Digital Content 3 ( http://links.lww.com/NEU/E272 ).\n\nInfection in Total (Children and Adult) Population\n\nAll 27 studies were included in this analysis. 40 - 46 Our result showed that the bacterial infection rate was associated with significantly lower rate of bacterial VP-shunt infection, when using AISC (OR = 0.42; CI: 0.33-0.54) (Figure 2 ).\n\nAge-Based Subgroups\n\nThe patients in this analysis were categorized into 2 groups based on their age: the adult group (18 years or older) and the pediatric group (younger than 18 years). The analysis of 14 studies conducted in the pediatric group showed significant improvement in the results with AISC (OR 0.38; 95% CI: 0.27-0.53; I 2 = 43%), and the difference was statistically significant ( P < .01) (2, 26-29). Only 4 studies were conducted in the adult group, and the outcomes indicated that AISC may also help prevent bacterial infections in the adult population; however, this result was not significant (OR = 0.50; CI: 0.22-1.13; I 2 = 32%) 5 , 7 , 47 , 48 (Figure 3 ).\n\nUnder 1-Year-Old Subgroup\n\nWe conducted an analysis of 4 articles that specifically differentiated patients younger than 1-year-old and 8 articles where all patients were older than 1 years. 5 , 7 , 47 - 54 Our findings indicated that the improvement in results with AISC was significantly greater (OR = 0.32; 95% CI: 0.19-0.53; I 2 = 0%) among patients younger than 1 year. On the other hand, in the remaining 8 articles that categorized patients older than 1 year, the use of AISC also showed a tendency that less bacterial VP-shunt infection occurred in these patients, but this tendency was not significant (OR 0.64; 95% CI: 0.38-1.08; I 2 = 49%) (Figure 4 ).\n\nRCTs and Observational Studies Subgroups\n\nIn this meta-analysis, we analyzed 4 RCTs and 23 retrospective observational studies. In the RCT subgroup, although the pooled OR was again below 1 (favoring AISC), but this outcome is far from being significant (OR 0.62; 95% CI: 0.22-1.79; I 2 = 66%). On the contrary, the analysis of observational studies supported the beneficial effect of AISC (OR, 0.39; 95% CI: 0.30-0.51; I 2 = 40%), but in this case, the study design diminishes the strength of the evidence (Figure 5 ).\n\nShunt Failure\n\nWe analyzed the frequency of shunt failure and removal using data from 9 articles, 4 , 17 , 54 - 60 four of which were RCTs. 4 , 17 , 54 , 58 Our results indicated that antibiotic-impregnated VP shunts are associated with a lower incidence of shunt failure, but the difference was not statistically significant (OR, 0.73; 95% CI: 0.51-1.06; I 2 = 70%) (Figure 6 ).\n\nCost of Care Related to AISC\n\nWe analyzed the cost of care in 4 retrospective studies. 7 , 48 , 55 , 61 Two article mentioned the total infection-related cost, one the cost of shunt infection per case and one the infection-related cost per 100 de novo shunt placed ( Supplemental Digital Content 4 , http://links.lww.com/NEU/E273 ).\n\nRisk of Bias Assessment and Quality/Certainty of Evidence\n\nMost of the studies had a high risk of bias. Only 5 studies were scored with moderate risk of bias. 7 , 12 , 47 , 55 , 56 The bias in the measurement of outcomes had the highest risk of bias. The results of the risk of bias assessment are presented in Supplemental Digital Content 5 ( http://links.lww.com/NEU/E274 ) and Supplemental Digital Content 6 ( http://links.lww.com/NEU/E275 ).\n\nBased on the results and the careful evaluation of the evidence level, the certainty levels were very low because most of the included studies (23/27) were considered observational studies. The certainty level for bacterial infection in RCTs was moderate ( Supplemental Digital Content 7 , http://links.lww.com/NEU/E276 ).\n\nHeterogeneity and Publication Bias\n\nIn our analysis of 27 studies, we observed relatively low heterogeneity in the case of the primary outcome (from 39% to 48%). Nevertheless, we had high heterogeneity (70%) in our secondary outcome, which we attributed to differences in the sample size, the type of surgery (urgent/planned), and the patient population (adults/mostly neonates). We discovered publication bias, which could be due to the inclination of researchers to publish favorable results.\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nBased on the results of this meta-analysis, the use of AISCs was associated with the reduction in the incidence of bacterial cerebrospinal fluid shunt infections in neurosurgical patients. Patients with standard VP shunts had a 1.85 to 3 times higher odds of developing a bacterial VP-shunt infection.\n\nAccording to a study by McGirt et al, 62 VP shunt infection occurs in approximately one in every 10 patients, with the lowest proportion being one in 20 patients undergoing initial shunt placement. The highest infection rates on admission were observed in patients with a history of previous shunt revisions, with a rate of 38% among various patient groups. 63\n\nOn conducting a subgroup analysis in our study, we found that the antibacterial effect of AISC tended to be more efficient in preventing shunt infection in children compared with adults. Furthermore, subgroup analysis based on patient age revealed that the most prominent antimicrobial effect of AISC was found in infants younger than 1 year, who are known to be more susceptible to bacterial infections because of their fragile immune systems.\n\nWe also conducted a subgroup analysis based on the study design, dividing the studies into 4 RCTs and 23 observational studies. Our findings indicated that the evidence coming from RCTs is weak because of the wide CI (mainly because of low number and high heterogeneity [between 1% and 89%] of articles, only 1 out of the 4 articles is significant); evidence coming from the observational studies is weak because of the inherent limitations of the study design.\n\nWe also investigated the incidence of shunt failure and removal in patients with AISC compared with non-AISC. The main cause of shunt failures is infection. The overall OR indicates that AISC could help prevent shunt failure, the wide CI suggests the role of other factors next to infection, such as obstruction, intracranial bleeding, and peritoneal adhesions, which could also lead to shunt failure. In the study of Attenello et al, 55 the OR is 0.34 (CI: 0.24-0.48). They investigated pediatric patients without risk factors like diabetes, steroid treatment, and cerebrospinal fluid leakage from wounds. While the OR in Wong et al 54 study is 1.27 (CI: 0.37-4.32), which can be explained by the more complicated adult population who had mostly urgent surgeries and had other risk factors, like skull base fracture or craniotomy. In addition, the rate of shunt failure caused by infection may vary because of differences in perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis and hygienic circumstances in different hospitals.\n\nOur cumulative forest plot showed that we have had available data about the efficacy of AISC in preventing bacterial infection since 2007 (Figure 7 ). We also investigated the cost of care related to AISC in 4 retrospective studies 7 , 48 , 55 , 61 ; however, we could not analyze them statistically. Our findings indicate that cost of care related to non-AISC shunts are twice as expensive as cost of care related to AISC shunts, suggesting that AISC could be a cost-effective treatment option ( Supplemental Digital Content 4 , http://links.lww.com/NEU/E273 ).\n\nLimitations\n\nOne of the strengths of this meta-analysis is that we used 27 articles from different countries with a huge number of patients (27 265) and different populations. We followed a rigorous methodology and conducted a PROSPERO registration in advance, following the PRISMA and Cochrane Handbook recommendations. However, as a limitation we have to state that most of the available data are from observational cohort studies, where only association and not direct causation effect can be concluded. Another limitation is that patients had different risk factors.\n\nWe also had high risk of bias using 2 tools, the (ROBINS-I), and (Rob2) tool ( Supplemental Digital Content 5 [ http://links.lww.com/NEU/E274 ] and Supplemental Digital Content 6 [ http://links.lww.com/NEU/E275 ]).\n\nWe incorporated research derived from administrative databases. It is important to acknowledge that such studies are susceptible to errors, which may, in some cases, surpass the potential magnitude of errors encountered in conventional retrospective investigations relying on chart reviews or case logs.\n\nImplications for Practice and Research\n\nOur findings suggest the need for further research to evaluate the effectiveness of AISC, particularly in different subgroups. Thus, it is crucial to conduct additional studies focusing on diverse subgroups, such as different age groups, sexes, indication of the surgery, and types and severity of infections. In addition, research efforts could explore the cost-effectiveness of AISCs compared with non-AISCs.\n\nFurthermore, future studies should investigate alternative approaches to reducing shunt infection rates. These may include improving surgical techniques, developing novel biomaterials, or enhancing immune system responses. Exploring these avenues can provide valuable insights into reducing the occurrence of shunt infections.\n\nBased on our current data, we recommend that neurosurgeons consider the use of AISCs as a potential option for mitigating the risk of shunt infection in their patients. Moreover, our study underscores the significance of implementing stringent infection control measures during both shunt implantation surgery and postoperative care, regardless of whether AISCs are employed.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nOur results suggest the use of AISCs as a preventive method against infection, especially in infants, moreover also for adults with chronic diseases.",
