  "abstract": "Background/Objectives : The use of medicines in pediatrics and geriatrics is widespread. However, information on pharmacokinetics of therapeutic drugs mainly comes from healthy adults, and the pharmacokinetic parameters of therapeutic drugs in other age stages, including pediatrics and geriatrics, are limited.

The number of pediatric clinical studies is substantially lower than the number of adult clinical studies due to ethical and clinical trial acceptance, leading to pediatric drug development lagging behind adult drug development [ 1 ]. The dosage regiment of drugs used for children is often based on scaled-down adults. However, the organs/tissue and physiological functions of children are always altered along with their growth and development. These alterations in turn affect the pharmacokinetic behaviors of drugs and their clinic efficiencies, leading to differences between pediatrics and adults, even among children in different age stages [ 2 ]. According to the FDA and the International Conference on Harmonization (ICH), the categorizations of the pediatric population are premature (gestational age ≤ 36 weeks), newborns (birth to 1 month of age), infants (1–23 months of age), children (2–11 years), and adolescents (12–16/18 years) [ 3 ].\n\nThe global elderly population is rapidly growing. It was estimated that 16% of the global population will be older than 65 years by 2050 [ 4 ]. Elderly peoples are divided into three categories (‘elderly adults’ (61–75 years), ‘old’ persons (76–90 years), and the ‘oldest old’ (over 90 years)) [ 5 ] or four categories (the late middle age (60–64 years), the young-old (65–74 years), old-old (75–84 years) and oldest old (85 years and older)) [ 6 ]. Most of these elder people often suffer from some diseases, consuming an average of two to five medications per day [ 7 ]. However, the pharmacokinetic information of the drugs used in elderly populations is often limited, and elderly patients often receive the same dosage regimen of drugs used for younger patients [ 8 ]. Accumulating evidence has demonstrated that some physiological functions of elderly people can be altered along with increasing age [ 9 , 10 , 11 ], including decreases in gastrointestinal motility, gastrointestinal blood flow, lean body mass, serum albumin, hepatic size, hepatic blood flow, renal blood flow and glomerular filtration rate, as well as increases in gastric pH and adipose mass [ 9 ]. For example, the liver volume and liver blood flow of 91-year-old men were, respectively, decreased to be 70% and 57% of that 21-year-old men [ 12 ]. Creatinine clearance (CL CR ) declined linearly across the age span [ 10 , 13 ]. It was reported that CL CR decreased from 140 mL/min/1.73 m 2 at an age of 30 years to 97 mL/min/1.73 m 2 at 80 years of age [ 13 ]. The alterations in physiological functions of elderly people may affect the pharmacokinetics of drugs used in elderly patients, in turn altering the clinical efficiencies of the drugs. A clinic trial showed that the area under the curve (AUC) of triazolam following oral 0.25 mg triazolam increased and clearance decreased with age (20- to 75-year-old men). The AUC of triazolam increased from 9.8 ± 1.4 ng.h/mL in the young group (20–36 years) to 17.2 ± 4.0 ng.h/mL in the elderly group (60–75 years), accompanied by the greater pharmacodynamics effects of triazolam [ 14 ]. The AUC values of S-verapamil and R-verapamil in elderly men (68 ± 5 years) following oral 80 mg verapamil were, respectively, 4.3-fold and 2.7-fold of younger peoples (21 ± 2 years). Consistently, the mean pulse rate in the elderly group was significantly decreased (at 1.5 and 4 h following verapamil) and the mean PQ interval was significantly prolonged (at 1.5 h following verapamil), which did not occur in the young group [ 15 ].\n\nThe physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model is established on the basis of the physiological and biochemical properties of organisms, the anatomical properties of organisms and the thermodynamic properties of drugs. The PBPK model can be used to assess the effects of physiological and pathophysiological changes on the pharmacokinetics of drugs and has been used to predict alterations in the pharmacokinetics of drugs used in pediatric [ 1 , 2 , 16 , 17 ] and elderly patients [ 8 ].\n\nOver 70% of clinical drugs are metabolized by cytochrome P450 enzymes. CYP3A4/5 represents the most prevalent form of hepatic CYP450 enzymes, accounting for approximately 30–60% of the total hepatic CYP450 and mediating a metabolism of about 50% clinical drugs [ 18 , 19 , 20 ]. Several reports have demonstrated that the age significantly affects CYP3A4 activity. It was reported that the total intrinsic clearance of triazolam at hepatic microsomes from men aged at 14–20 years, 21–40 years, 41–60 years and 61–72 years were 25.2, 89.8, 78 and 20.6 μL/min/mg protein. Consistently, the levels of hepatic CYP3A protein in hepatic microsomes were, respectively, 17.1, 425.6, 127.3 and 43.7 pmol/mg protein [ 21 ]. The activity of hepatic CYP3A, indexed as a clearance of midazolam in preterm neonates, was also less than that in term neonates [ 22 ].\n\nMidazolam is a short-acting benzodiazepine with anxiolytic, muscle-relaxant, anticonvulsant, sedative, hypnotic and amnesic properties. Midazolam is widely used for sedation and pre-surgical medication. Midazolam is also one of the most widely used sedatives in the “neonatal intensive care unit” [ 23 ]. Alfentanil, fentanyl and sufentanil are synthetic opioid analgesics which act as specific opioid receptors. They are widely used as analgesics to supplement general anaesthesia for various surgical procedures over the entire human age range [ 24 ]. Currently, fentanyl is the most frequently used opioid analgesic in neonatal intensive care units [ 25 ]. Fentanyl, alfentanil and sufentanil are mainly metabolized by hepatic CYP3A4 enzyme [ 26 , 27 , 28 ].\n\nThe aim of this study was to develop a dynamic age-dependent PBPK model to predict drug pharmacokinetics over the entire human age range from preterm neonates to the oldest old people using the CYP3A4-mediated metabolized drugs midazolam, fentanyl, alfentanil and sufentanil as model drugs and to validate the developed dynamic age-dependent PBPK model using clinical observations. A sensitivity analysis was performed to assess the impact of variability in physiological and biochemical parameters on the pharmacokinetics of the tested drugs. The developed dynamic age-dependent PBPK model was tried to facilitate dose optimization in pediatric and elderly patients.\n\n2. Method\n\n2.1. General Workflow\n\nThe workflow for developing a dynamic age-dependent PBPK model was shown in Figure 1 . A dynamic age-dependent PBPK model was developed to predict pharmacokinetics of drugs metabolized by CYP3A over the entire human age range from preterm neonates to the oldest old people. One thousand virtual individuals were constructed. In order to simulate the inter-individual and intra-individual variability of these parameters, the exponential model and additive residual error model were used. The model used the first-order conditional Lindstrom–Bates (FOCE L-B) estimation method. The effective permeability coefficient (P eff ) [ 29 , 30 ] of drugs across the intestinal wall, free fraction (f u,b ) [ 31 , 32 , 33 , 34 ] of drug in blood, hepatic intrinsic clearance (CL int,l ) [ 35 ], intestinal intrinsic clearance (CL int,i ) [ 35 ], the ratio of drug concentration in blood to plasma (R b ) [ 30 , 31 ] and the total amount of hepatic microsomal protein (PBSF) [ 35 ] were set as the random effect parameters of the virtual individuals, and these parameters were assumed to vary between 0.67 and 1.5 times of the ideal values at the corresponding age stages, based on the variation of clinical and non-clinical observations. Following validation using clinical observations in adults from literature, the developed PBPK model was extrapolated to all different age stages, including pediatrics and geriatrics, by replacing the values of system-specific model parameters (anatomical, biochemical and physiological parameters). The pharmacokinetics of the tested drugs were predicted in 1000 virtual individuals of corresponding age stages and compared with clinical observed pharmacokinetic data from the literature. The validated PBPK model was then used to optimize the drug dosage for populations of the corresponding age stages (pediatrics and geriatrics) based on drug plasma exposure in adults.\n\n2.2. Development of Dynamic Age-Dependent PBPK Model\n\nA dynamic age-dependent PBPK model ( Figure S1 ) was developed to describe the pharmacokinetic profiles of midazolam, fentanyl, alfentanil and sufentanil in the plasma of the entire human age range following oral or intravenous administrations. The dynamic age-dependent PBPK model consists of stomach, intestine, liver, spleen, kidneys, muscle, adipose tissue, skin, heart, brain, lungs, and other tissue, which are connected by the blood circulatory system. The intestine is divided into the duodenum, jejunum, ileum, cecum and colon according to the characteristics of physiology and anatomy. Each intestinal segment is further divided into the intestinal wall and lumen. Drugs are mainly eliminated via the liver and kidneys. Drug metabolism also occurs at the wall of duodenum, jejunum and ileum. For oral administration, drug absorption only occurs in duodenum, jejunum and ileum. The essential structure of the dynamic age-dependent PBPK model ( Figure S1 ) and its corresponding mass equations are illustrated in the Supplementary Information .\n\n2.3. Development and Optimization of PBPK Models in Adults\n\nThe drug-specific parameters and physiological parameters of adults used in the simulations were, respectively, listed in Tables S1 and S2 . Plasma concentrations of the four drugs in 1000 virtual individuals were predicted on Phoenix WinNonlin software (Version 8.4, Certara, Radnor, PA, USA). The simulation results were further compared with clinical observations.\n\nThe plasma concentration profiles of drugs in 1000 virtual adult individuals were simulated using the PBPK model. The 5th, 50th and 95th percentiles of plasma concentration profiles were obtained and compared with clinical observations. The pharmacokinetic parameters, such as the concentration–time curve (AUC 0–t ) and peak concentration (C max ) were also estimated from the 50th percentiles of plasma concentration profiles.\n\nTwo aspects were used to evaluate the successful development of the dynamic age-dependent PBPK model. (i) The observed plasma concentration profiles fell within the 5th–95th percentiles of simulations based on 1000 virtual individuals; (ii) The simulations using the developed PBPK model were within the 0.5–2.0-fold of clinic observations. In addition, the following two model prediction performance indicators were calculated for simulations (AUC 0–t and C max ). We also evaluate simulations using the average fold error (AFE) and the average absolute prediction error (PE%).\n\nThe AFE was defined by the equation [ 36 ]\n\nThe prediction may be considered satisfactory if the AFE is between 0.8 and 1.25, passable if the AFE is within 0.5–0.8 or 1.25–2 and poor if the AFE is within 0–0.5 or above 2.\n\nThe average absolute prediction error (PE%) is defined by equation [ 36 ]\n\nThe prediction may be considered satisfactory if the PE is less than 25%, passable if the PE is between 25 and 50% and poor if the PE is ≥50%.\n\n2.4. Extrapolation to the Pediatric PBPK Model\n\nThe PBPK model, following validation and optimization in adults, was extrapolated to pediatrics. One thousand virtual pediatric individuals (newborns, infants, children and adolescents) were constructed. Physiological parameters (such as organ volumes and organ blood flow) and parameters related to drugs at corresponding age stages were adjusted as follows. Physiological parameters (such as organ volumes and organ blood flow) of pediatrics along with age were estimated using the equations listed in Tables S3 and S4 .\n\nThe body weight (BW, kg) and height (H, cm) of pediatrics were estimated using equation [ 37 ]. where Y is body weight or height. A is age (year). The correlation coefficients a, b, c and d are shown in Table S5 .\n\nThe gastric emptying time of neonates (0–27 days), infants (1–23 months), children (2–11 years), adolescents (12–18 years) and adults (>18 years) were, respectively, 68 min (54–82 min), 41 min (12–70 min), 41 min (12–70 min), 75 min (12–138 min) and 62.5 min (5–120 min); no obvious age-dependent differences were observed. The intestinal transit time in pediatrics was also similar to that in adults [ 38 ]. Here, the gastric emptying time and intestinal transit time in pediatrics were assumed to be similar to those for adults.\n\nThe intestinal radius (r, m) was associated with body surface area (BSA), which may be calculated using the following equation [ 39 ]: where BSA may be estimated using the following equations [ 40 , 41 ]: and\n\nThe activity of the hepatic CYP3A4 increased along with growth and development, which may be illustrated by equation [ 39 ]. The ratio (R CYP3A,pediatric ) of hepatic CYP3A activity as follows:\n\nThe impact of gestational age on the development of newborns and preterm infants was of critical importance. The activity of the hepatic CYP3A4 in neonates and preterm infants was illustrated by an equation as follows [ 42 ]: where R CYP3A,neonate/preterm is the ratio of hepatic CYP3A activity in neonates or preterm infants to adults. The PMA is the postmenstrual age (year). PMA is the sum of the gestational age (GA) and postnatal age (PNA).\n\nHepatic microsome protein also varied with age, and the microsomal protein per gram of liver (MPPGL, mg protein/g liver) was estimated using equation [ 43 ].\n\nThe intrinsic hepatic clearance (CL int,pediatric ) in pediatrics was illustrated by the following equation: where CL int,adult,l and LW pediatric are the intrinsic hepatic clearance of the drugs in the hepatic microsomes (mL/min/mg) of adults and the liver weight of pediatrics, respectively.\n\nThe expressions of intestinal CYP3A were altered along with age; the fraction (R CYP3A,pediatric,i ) of adult intestinal CYP3A may be estimated using the following equation:\n\nThe intrinsic intestinal clearance (CL int,pediatric,i ) in pediatrics was illustrated by the following equation: where CL int,pediatric,l and A adult,i are the hepatic clearance of the drugs in the CYP3A (mL/min/pmol) of pediatrics and the CYP3A4 abundance in adults’ intestines, respectively.\n\nThe levels of plasma albumin (ALB) and alpha1-acid glycoprotein (AAG) levels also increased along with age, leading to a decrease in f u,b . The levels of plasma ALB (g/L) in preterm infants and pediatrics were, respectively, estimated using the following equations.\n\nFor preterm infants [ 42 ]\n\nFor pediatrics [ 39 , 44 ],\n\nLevels of plasma AAG in pediatrics were calculated using the following equation. where R AAG,pediatrics and AAG adult are the ratios of the AGG level in pediatrics and the AGG level in adults, respectively. Here, the AGG level in adults was set to be 0.61 g/L [ 45 ]. The R AGG,pediatrics was calculated using following equation [ 46 ]: where the “days” represent the number of days after birth.\n\nThe unbound fraction (f u,pediatrics ) of drugs in the plasma of pediatrics was estimated using the following equation [ 46 ]: where f u,adult is the unbound fraction of drug in plasma of adults. P pediatrics and P adult are the levels of plasma ALB (or AAG) in pediatrics and adults, respectively.\n\nFollowing obtaining physiological parameters and pharmacokinetic parameters in pediatrics, 1000 virtual pediatric individuals were constructed. The pharmacokinetic profiles of drugs in the 1000 virtual pediatric individuals were simulated. The 5th, 50th and 95th percentiles of plasma concentration-profiles were obtained and compared with clinical observations from pediatrics at corresponding age stages.\n\n2.5. Extrapolation to the Geriatrics PBPK Model\n\nThe physiological parameters including height, weight, body surface area, tissue and organ volume, and blood flow in the elderly were altered along with increasing ages, which were estimated using equations listed in Tables S6 and S7 .\n\nIn consideration of the hepatic metabolism of drugs, it was reported that, in predicted clearances from 30 to 35 years, the MPPGL decreased along with increasing adult age until approximately 80–85 years. Then, the MPPGL failed to decrease further with advancing age. More importantly, the MPPGL at 85–90 years and 90–95 years were higher than those at 80–85 years [ 47 ]. The relationships between the MPPGL in the elderly and age were illustrated using the following equations: and where A is age (year).\n\nIt was reported that the activity of the CYP3A4 enzyme in the elderly population decreased by 8% per decade [ 48 , 49 ]; thus, the ratio of CYP3A in the elderly to 40-year-old adults was illustrated by following equation\n\nThe intrinsic hepatic clearance of drug in the elderly (CL int,elderly ) can be expressed as follows: where CL int,adult,l is the intrinsic hepatic clearance of the drug in the microsomes (mL/min/mg) of adults; the MPPGL elderly and LW elderly are the productivity of hepatic microsomes and liver weight in the elderly, respectively.\n\nThe intrinsic intestinal clearance of drugs in the elderly (CL int,elderly,i ) was assumed to be the same as in adults, which may be corrected by the body weight at a special age.\n\nIt was shown that, from 20 to 90 years, ALB concentration (g/L) decreased with increasing age [ 47 ], which was illustrated by the following equation:\n\nHowever, the AAG concentration did not change with age. Here, the AAG level in the elderly was set to be 0.58 g/L.\n\nThe unbound fraction (f u,elderly ) of drugs in plasma in the elderly was estimated using Equation (15).\n\nFollowing the obtaining of physiological parameters and pharmacokinetic parameters in the elderly, 1000 virtual individuals of different elderly age stages were constructed. The pharmacokinetic profiles of drugs in the 1000 virtual elderly individuals were simulated. The 5th, 50th and 95th percentiles of plasma concentration profiles were obtained and compared with clinical observations at corresponding elderly age stages.\n\n2.6. Sensitivity Analysis\n\nParameters such as physiological parameters (Q l , PBSF and K ti ) and pharmacokinetic parameters (f u,b , P eff and CL int,l ) were selected for sensitivity analyses using midazolam as a model drug. In local sensitivity analysis evaluations, the variabilities of Q l [ 50 , 51 ], f u,b [ 31 , 32 ] and K ti [ 52 ] was set at 0.5, 1 and 2 times, while the variabilities of PBSF and CL int,l were set at 0.1, 1 and 10 times [ 35 ]. Midazolam was given to adults via an oral dose (10 mg) [ 53 ] or an intravenous dose of 0.75 mg over 2 min [ 54 ]. A global sensitivity analysis (GSA) evaluation was also performed for the identification of the more accurate parameter’s contribution. The variability of parameters was set as the same as the local sensitivity analysis. A GSA was performed with the R (Version 4.4.2), RStudio (Version 2024.12.0+467) and RXODE2 package. Total order sensitivity indices and first-order sensitivity indices was estimated using the SOBOL method [ 55 ] for the GSA. Corresponding script are included in the Supplementary File S2 .\n\n2.7. Pediatrics and Geriatrics Dose Optimization\n\nMidazolam served as an example of clinical dose optimization in pediatrics and geriatrics. According to age, the patients were divided into 0–0.083 year old, 0.083–0.5 year old, 0.5–1 year old, 1–2 years old, 2–5 years old, 5–9 years old, 9–12 years old, 12–15 years old, 15–18 years old, 19–59 years old, 60–65 years old, 65–75 years old, 75–85 years old and ≥85 years old. The pediatric and the geriatric dosages of midazolam were optimized to achieve AUC and C max values of midazolam that were similar (within 15% deviation) to those following i.v. 0.75 mg midazolam [ 54 ].\n\n2.8. Collection of Data\n\nThe pharmacokinetic data of the midazolam, fentanyl, alfentanil and sufentanil following oral or intravenous dose to the entire human age range (from preterm to the oldest old) were collected from the data published on PubMed based on the following criteria. (1) The tested drugs must be mainly metabolized by hepatic CYP3A. The fraction of the CYP3A-mediated metabolism was over 70%. (2) The pharmacokinetics of the tested drugs were examined in the pediatric patients, adults and the elderly, whose plasma concentrations profiles or pharmacokinetic parameters were simultaneously shown. The plasma concentration profiles may be digitized using the Engauge Digitizer. (3) The tested drugs were administrated via an oral or intravenous route. (4) The clinical pharmacokinetic data might come from different reports or patients, but the diseases did not affect the pharmacokinetics of the tested drugs.\n\n3. Result\n\nA total of 166 sets of data from the clinical studies involving four CYP3A4 substrate drugs were collected ( Tables S8–S11 ), including 85 sets for midazolam, 54 sets for fentanyl, 15 sets for alfentanil and 12 sets for sufentanil; 43 sets of data were for pediatrics (23 sets for midazolam, 12 sets for fentanyl, 5 sets for alfentanil and 3 sets for sufentanil); 102 sets of data were for adults (52 sets for midazolam, 36 sets for fentanyl, 9 sets for alfentanil and 5 sets for sufentanil); 21 sets of data were for the elderly (10 sets for midazolam, 6 sets for fentanyl, 1 set for alfentanil and 4 sets for sufentanil). Forty-one sets of data were for pediatrics (21 sets for midazolam, 12 sets for fentanyl, 5 sets for alfentanil and 3 sets for sufentanil).\n\n3.1. Model Validation in Adults\n\nThe established PBPK model was employed to forecast the pharmacokinetic profiles of the four drugs in 1000 virtual adults, with the results being subsequently compared with the clinical observations ( Figure 2 , Figure 3 , Figures S2 and S3 ). The results demonstrated that almost all of the observed plasma concentrations fell within the 5th–95th interval of the simulations from 1000 virtual adults. Furthermore, the pharmacokinetic parameters such as AUC and C max were estimated using the 50th percentile of simulated plasma concentrations and compared with the clinical observations ( Tables S12–S16 ). The results demonstrated that the almost predicted AUC (97/97) and C max (28/28) were within a range of 0.5–2-folds of the observed values and that the AFE (0.9) and PE (15.1%) were satisfactory, indicating the successful development of a PBPK model for the four drugs in adults.\n\n3.2. PBPK Model in Pediatrics\n\nThe developed PBPK models were extrapolated to pediatrics to predict the pharmacokinetic profiles of the four drugs following administration to newborns, infants, children and adolescents. The 5th, 50th and 95th percentiles of plasma concentration profiles from 1000 virtual pediatrics were obtained and compared with clinical observations from pediatrics at corresponding age stages ( Figure 4 and Figure S4 ). The results showed that, among the selected 43 sets of data, except for two sets of data, other clinic observations almost fell within the 5th to 95th percentile range of the simulations. The pharmacokinetic parameters were estimated from the 50th percentile of plasma concentration profiles and compared with clinical observations ( Tables S12–S16 ) The results demonstrated that the predicted AUC (34/35) and C max (5/6) were within a range of 0.5–2-folds of the observed values, and that the AFE (1.1), PE (24.0%) was also satisfactory. These results indicated successful modelling of four drugs in pediatrics.\n\n3.3. PBPK Model in Geriatrics\n\nThe developed PBPK models were further extrapolated to geriatrics to predict the pharmacokinetic profiles of the four drugs following administration to the late middle age, the young-old, old-old and oldest old. The 5th, 50th and 95th percentiles of plasma concentration profiles from 1000 virtual pediatrics were obtained and compared with clinical observations from geriatrics at corresponding age stages ( Figure 5 ). The pharmacokinetic parameters were estimated from 50th percentile of plasma concentration-profiles and compared with clinical observations ( Tables S12–S16 ). The results demonstrated that almost all of the observed plasma concentrations fell within the 5th–95th interval of the simulations from 1000 virtual adults. In addition, the results also demonstrated that the predicted AUC (19/19) and C max (4/5) were within a range of 0.5–2-folds of the observed values and that the AFE (1.1), PE (24.2%) was also satisfactory. The above results indicated successful modelling of four drugs in geriatrics.\n\n3.4. Sensitivity Analysis of Model Parameters\n\nThe physiological parameters Q l , PBSF, K ti and the pharmacological parameters f u,b , CL int,l , P eff were selected for local sensitivity analyses to observe the effects of these parameters on the plasma concentrations of midazolam following oral administration and intravenous administration of midazolam, fentanyl, alfentanil and sufentanil ( Figure 6 A–F). The findings indicated that alterations in PBSF and CL int,l exerted a more pronounced influence on the plasma concentrations of the four drugs administered intravenously followed by f u,b and Q l . These results align with our hypothesis that these four drugs are primarily metabolized by hepatic CYP3A4 and, thus, an increase in PBSF and CL int,l would consequently impact the metabolic rate and the plasma concentrations. Furthermore, following oral administration of midazolam, an increase in P eff will elevate C max , while K ti exerted a diminished influence on the midazolam concentrations. A global sensitivity analysis revels the SOBOL sensitivity indices of the six parameters in the PBPK model of midazolam ( Figure 6 G). Compared with other parameters, PBSF, CL int,l and f u,b are the key parameters of the model output (AUC 0–24 ). When the first-order sensitivity indices (S1) are considered, the three parameters were not as critical as when the total order sensitivity indices (ST) were considered. This suggested that there is a strong interaction between PBSF, CL int,l and f u,b . In comparison, the effect of Q l is weaker and the effects of K ti and P eff are much smaller, based on ST or S1.\n\n3.5. Virtual Simulation for Pediatric and Geriatrics Dose Optimization\n\nThe effects of age on the AUC and C max of midazolam at clinically recommended doses were also recorded ( Figure 7 ). The recommended clinical dose of midazolam is 0.05 mg/kg for <6 months, 0.05–0.01 mg/kg for pediatrics aged 6 months–6 years, 0.025–0.05 mg/kg for pediatrics aged 6–12 years, 0.5–1 mg for pediatrics aged > 12 years (as well as adults) and 1–1.5 mg for geriatrics [ 53 ]. The results showed that the AUC and C max of midazolam were higher than those of adults at the recommended clinical dose in the pediatric groups, with special attention being paid to the fact that the AUC and C max values of 0.17 mg midazolam injected into infants at 1 month (≈0.083 year) of age were 6.16 and 2.47 times higher than those of adults injected with recommended 0.75 mg midazolam. In geriatrics, the AUC and C max were within a range of 1.5–2.5 times higher than those of adults at the recommended clinical dose.\n\nDirect comparisons were made by a Box–Whisker analysis to account for the pharmacokinetic variability in pediatrics and the elderly. We constructed nine groups of pediatrics and four groups of geriatrics for the dose design of midazolam. As shown ( Figure 7 ), the dose of sedated midazolam should be adjusted to 8.4 μg/kg for 0–0.083 year, 11.91 μg/kg for 0.083–0.5 year, 16.32 μg/kg for 0.5–1 year, 17.59 μg/kg for 1–2 years, 17.70 μg/kg for 2–5 years, 15.43 μg/kg for 5–9 years, 13.37 μg/kg for 9–12 years, 12.88 μg/kg for 12–15 years, 12.40 μg/kg for 15–18 years, 8.3 μg/kg for 60–65 years and 7.82 μg/kg for 65–75 years, 7.38 μg/kg for 75–85 years and 7.24 μg/kg for >85 years of age to make the AUC 0–t comparable to that of an adult dose of 0.75 mg of midazolam administered intravenously. To make the C max comparable to that of an adult dose of 0.75 mg of midazolam administered intravenously, the dose of sedated midazolam should be adjusted to 22.41 μg/kg for 0–0.083 years, 18.58 μg/kg for 0.083–0.5 year, 17.10 μg/kg for 0.5–1 year, 18.16 μg/kg for 1–2 years, 19.37 μg/kg for 2–5 years, 17.44 μg/kg for 5–9 years, 14.31 μg/kg for 9–12 years, 13.24 μg/kg for 12–15 years, 12.41 μg/kg for 15–18 years, 8.96 μg/kg for 60–65 years, and 8.82 μg/kg for 65–75 years, 8.68 μg/kg for 75–85 years and 8.63 μg/kg for >85 years. The results showed that optimized dosages of midazolam in pediatrics (<12 years) and geriatrics (>60 years) were lower than recommended dosages.\n\n4. Discussion\n\nIt is challenging to recruit patients from vulnerable groups, such as pediatrics and geriatrics, for clinical trials of drugs. This is because these groups require additional safeguards during the research process [ 115 ]. Despite the increasing need for medications in pediatrics and the elderly, clinical studies rarely target these age groups [ 116 ]. Furthermore, a limited number of clinical observations and time points exist. Dosing in pediatrics as well as in the elderly needs to take into account the changes in physiological and biological parameters with ages. Thus, a PBPK model characterizing age-related changes in physiological and biochemical parameters was developed to simulate the disposition of the drugs in both pediatrics and the elderly; this will provide help for the designment of dosages in both populations. Midazolam, fentanyl, alfentanil and sufentanil served as model drugs. The established PBPK model was first validated by plasma drug concentration–time curves after oral or intravenous administration of model drugs in adults. Then, the developed PBPK model was extrapolated to pediatrics and the elderly. The developed PBPK models could reasonably predict the pharmacokinetics of four model drugs in all age groups. The majority of measured values fell within the 5th to 95th percentile range of the predicted values, and the C max and AUC 0–t were consistently within 0.5 to 2.0 times of the clinical observations.\n\nDuring the modelling process, the four model drugs chosen belong to the CYP3A4 substrates, and the activity of the CYP3A4 enzyme is also an aspect that is considered in addition to anatomical and physiological parameters such as organ volume and organ blood flow. Enzyme activities and organ systems are constantly changed with age, especially for preterm neonates. The high variability in preterm neonates may explain the somewhat poorer simulation compared to other age populations [ 117 ]. Three equations were used to estimate the levels of ALB based on their age stages. Furthermore, the exposure of drugs at clinically recommended doses in different age groups was evaluated, including AUC 0–t and C max . Additionally, dose optimization in pediatrics and the elderly was investigated using established PBPK models to ensure the plasma exposures were comparable to those observed in adults, with midazolam serving as an illustrative example.\n\nFor midazolam, pediatrics dosing requires special attention. One study counted 1578 pediatric endoscopies with a median age of 10 years and intravenous midazolam doses of 0–0.39 mg/kg, which were higher than the model-optimized dose of 13.37/14.31 μg/kg for ages 9–12 years in Figure 7 . The results of adverse reaction statistics showed a 10% incidence of decreased oxygen saturation, 8% incidence of hypotension, 3% incidence of hypertension, and 5% incidence of vomiting [ 118 ]. In addition, Pena et al. counted cases observed in the emergency department of an urban pediatric teaching hospital from 1997 to 1998 and showed that, among pediatric patients receiving fentanyl for sedation and analgesia, case statistics showed that 84% of the pediatric patients who experienced adverse reactions had midazolam i.v doses (0.16 or 0.09 mg/kg) beyond the model-recommended values for the corresponding age group ( Figure 7 ), which may explain some of the adverse reactions in some patients, such as oxygen saturations of less than 90% (nine cases) and vomiting (three cases) [ 119 ]. In a study that administrated intravenous midazolam and ketamine for sedation in pediatric patients from 5 months to 17 years, it was observed that half of the children treated with 0.3 mg/kg of midazolam developed oxygen desaturation. It was notable that both the initiating (0.1 mg/kg) and terminating doses (0.4 mg/kg) were considerably higher than ten folds of the model-informed dose. This may help to explain the high incidence of adverse effects, including tachycardia (27.9%), increased secretion (17.6%), agitation (13.6%) and oxygen desaturation (8.4%) [ 120 ]. Similarly, a trial on 164 children demonstrated that the incidence of paradoxical reactions was significantly higher in children aged 1–3 years old who were sedated with midazolam at 0.1 mg/kg than in children aged 1–3 years old who were sedated at 0.05 mg/kg, both of which were higher than the incidence in children aged 3–5 years old who were sedated at 0.1 mg/kg [ 121 ]. The administered doses are at least two fold of the model-recommended dose of the 1–2 or 2–5-years-old groups, respectively ( Figure 7 ).\n\nFurthermore, the administration of fentanyl and midazolam in the elderly population merits particular attention. The metabolism of the same dose of intravenously delivered fentanyl in the elderly presents a risk of reduced clearance and an elevated half-life and AUC in comparison to younger volunteers [ 85 ]. Furthermore, another study demonstrated the probability of increased risk of respiratory depression with age for opioids, including fentanyl [ 122 ]. A further randomized, double-blind study indicated a notable reduction in mean blood pressure following the intravenous administration of 0.06 mg/kg midazolam in the elderly, while a comparatively minor reduction was observed in the 0.02 mg/kg dosing group. The decrease in oxygen saturation was significantly greater in the 0.06 mg/kg dosing group of older adults over 60 years compared to the 0.02 mg/kg dosing group [ 123 ].\n\nThis study represents an attempt to develop a PBPK model characterizing different stages of ages. It can be employed to achieve dose optimization in pediatric and geriatric populations. However, there are some limitations to our study. Firstly, there were limited data from clinical studies, some of which had a wide age range. Here, the age and body weight of the indicated patients were their mean values, which may be somewhat different from the patient’s actual situations. In addition, our model drugs are commonly used for intraoperative sedation and anesthesia, and we did not consider the effects of surgery on in vivo pharmacokinetics in the fitting process. A review of the literature revealed that the performance of certain surgical procedures, such as a cardiopulmonary bypass and extra-corporeal membrane oxygenation, during cardiac surgeries may result in unintended consequences in regard to pharmacokinetic parameters [ 124 , 125 , 126 , 127 ]. For example, Kumar et al. investigated the effects of a cardiopulmonary bypass on the plasma concentrations and protein binding of continuously infused alfentanil and found that the half-life of alfentanil was prolonged during the cardiopulmonary bypass and that there was a decrease in the plasma concentrations in vivo, as well as a significant decrease in the albumin and α-acid glycoprotein concentrations, corresponding to an increase in f u,p [ 127 ]. Another aspect worth pondering is that, when we performed dose optimization, we used AUC 0–t and C max as optimization metrics and did not take into account the pharmacodynamics (PD) metrics, which for some drugs, especially antimicrobials, may need to be integrated with PK-PD to assess the dose–effect relationship so that dose optimization will be more comprehensive and accurate. Although gender may affect the pharmacokinetics of some drugs, several studies [ 49 , 71 , 92 , 128 , 129 , 130 , 131 , 132 , 133 , 134 , 135 , 136 , 137 , 138 , 139 , 140 , 141 , 142 , 143 , 144 , 145 ] have demonstrated that gender did not obviously affect the pharmacokinetics of the four tested drugs. Thus, the effects of gender on pharmacokinetics were not considered in the simulation.\n\n5. Conclusions\n\nThe dynamic age-dependent PBPK model may successfully be applied to predict the pharmacokinetics of CYP3A4-mediated metabolized substrate drugs over the entire human age range and to design the dosage of CYP3A4 substrates.",
