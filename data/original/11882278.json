  "title": "Acute Implantation of a Bioresorbable Polymer Scaffold in Patients With Complete Thoracic Spinal Cord Injury: A Randomized Controlled Trial (INSPIRE 2.0)",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:: Traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI) remains a devastating condition with no proven effective treatment options available. In a prior single-arm study of patients with thoracic complete SCI (INSPIRE; ClinicalTrials.gov , NCT02138110 ), acute implantation of an investigational bioresorbable polymer scaffold (Neuro-Spinal Scaffold [NSS]) appeared to be safe through 24 months postimplantation and was associated with an American Spinal Injury Association Impairment Scale (AIS) conversion rate that exceeded historical controls. Here, we evaluated whether NSS implantation demonstrates probable benefit for safety and neurological recovery in patients with thoracic complete SCI vs standard-of-care spine surgery.\n\nMETHODS:: INSPIRE 2.0 was a randomized, controlled, parallel, multicenter study conducted at Level I trauma centers in the United States ( ClinicalTrials.gov , NCT03762655 ; funded by InVivo Therapeutics Corporation). Patients with AIS grade A, thoracic (T2-T12), nonpenetrating SCI requiring spine surgery ≤7 days postinjury were randomized (1:1, computer-generated allocation) to undergo NSS implantation or spine surgery alone (control group). Patients and follow-up International Standards for Neurological Classification of SCI assessors were blinded. A predefined study success criterion required the proportion of patients with improvement of ≥1 AIS grade at 6 months postsurgery (primary endpoint) to be ≥20% higher in the NSS group than in the control group.\n\nRESULTS:: Target enrollment was reached (N = 20) with 10 patients randomized and analyzed in each group. At 6 months postsurgery, an improvement in the AIS grade was reported in 2 NSS patients (20%; both to AIS C) and 3 control group patients (30%; to AIS B [n = 2] or AIS C [n = 1]). No serious or unanticipated adverse device effects were reported. The study was closed to further follow-up because of not meeting its primary endpoint.\n\nCONCLUSION:: In this small group of patients with thoracic complete (AIS A) SCI, implantation of an intraparenchymal bioresorbable scaffold did not produce probable clinical benefit. However, this study provides evidence that surgical intervention in an injured spinal cord parenchyma may be performed safely.",

  "full_text": "METHODS\n\nStudy Design and Oversight\n\nINSPIRE 2.0 was a randomized, controlled, parallel-group, multicenter Humanitarian Device Exemption probable benefit trial conducted in the United States ( ClinicalTrials.gov , NCT03762655 ). Within the Humanitarian Device Exemption regulatory pathway, Humanitarian Use Devices are exempt from effectiveness requirements but must be determined not to expose patients to an unreasonable or significant risk of illness or injury, and the probable benefit to health from using the device must outweigh the risk of injury or illness. Table 1 summarizes key planned study assessments. This preplanned analysis reports data through the 6-month primary endpoint follow-up visit.\n\nThis study was conducted following the ethical principles of the Declaration of Helsinki, the International Conference on Harmonization guidelines for Good Clinical Practice, and applicable regulatory requirements. All patients provided signed written informed consent before study enrollment or undergoing any study procedure. Each institution's respective Institutional Review Board/Research Ethics Board approved the protocol and all relevant study forms. An independent Data and Safety Monitoring Board conducted unblinded monitoring of all patients.\n\nEligibility\n\nEligible patients were aged 16 to 70 years and had complete (AIS A) traumatic SCI at T2-T12 neurological level of injury (NLI) with a requirement for spine surgery, allowing access to the injured spinal cord, ≤7 days from injury as part of standard treatment. The SCI was nonpenetrating (contusion injury) and ≥4 mm in diameter by MRI. Additional inclusion criteria were Injury Severity Score ≤45 at screening, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score ≥14 at screening (GCS score ≥10 for intubated patients), GCS score of 15 within 2 hours before surgery (GCS score ≥10 for intubated patients), and 8 hours of hemodynamic stability (systolic blood pressure >90 mm Hg) before surgery. Notable exclusions were >1 discrete SCI, complete spinal cord transection, clinically significant neurological or respiratory comorbidities, significant traumatic brain injury or coma, requirement for long-term ongoing mechanical ventilation, and evidence of clear and significant somatosensory-evoked potentials transmission through the injury site. All study sites were Level 1 trauma centers and were selected based on SCI case volume and experience from the INSPIRE study.\n\nRandomization and Blinding\n\nOn induction of anesthesia, patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to undergo SOC spine surgery followed by NSS implantation (NSS group) or SOC spine surgery alone (control group). The computer-generated random allocation sequence was not stratified, and a permuted block method was used (block size of 4). The Interactive Web Response System vendor created the randomization list and enrolled participants. The Interactive Response Technology system assigned patients to the appropriate treatment arm during the randomization visit. Patients and follow-up International Standards for Neurological Classification of SCI (ISNCSCI) assessors were blinded to treatment assignment for the study duration. A patient unblinding form allowed for emergency unblinding by the Interactive Web Response System vendor, which would trigger notification to study management. All study staff conducting ISNCSCI examinations had to provide documentation of training by approved trainers within 2 years of each study assessment. Study sites were encouraged to have a single assessor perform all follow-up examinations.\n\nStudy Interventions and Surgical Procedures\n\nAll patients underwent SOC spine surgery (eg, decompression, fusion, and stabilization). The same team of neurosurgeons could perform surgeries in either treatment group. Intraoperative ultrasound was performed to confirm the contusion size and location, and the presence or absence of a cavity, as initially assessed by the preoperative MRI. Investigators ensured patients continued to meet eligibility criteria before proceeding to implantation (NSS group) or after completion of spine stabilization and before surgical site closure (control group). Prophylactic antibiotics were administered perioperatively per institutional practice. A pulmonary embolism prophylaxis protocol was implemented and documented postsurgery through hospital discharge and had to include mechanical prophylaxis modalities and anticoagulation therapy. All patients participated in a comprehensive rehabilitation program after hospital discharge.\n\nFor the NSS group, an illustrative example of the surgical procedure including implantation is provided in Figure 1 . Further details, including an example intraoperative video, were published previously. 10 To standardize the NSS implantation procedure, all implanting neurosurgeons were trained on the proper storage, handling, and use of the NSS, using individual and SCI model training. A slide deck and instructional video were also available for reference before surgery.\n\nOutcomes\n\nThe primary endpoint was the proportion of patients with an improvement of ≥1 AIS grade from baseline at 6 months postsurgery. Key secondary efficacy endpoints were changes in NLI, sensory scores (total, light touch, and pinprick), motor scores (total, lower extremity, and upper extremity), and changes in spinal cord anatomy as determined by MRI. ISNCSCI endpoints were assessed at hospital discharge and 3 and 6 months postsurgery. MRI endpoints were evaluated at 3 and 6 months postsurgery. For this 6-month analysis, all safety events with start dates on or before Day 181 were included.\n\nStatistical Considerations\n\nFor the study to be deemed a success, the proportion of patients who demonstrated an improvement of ≥1 AIS grade at 6 months (primary endpoint) had to be ≥20% higher in the NSS group than the control group. This predefined criterion was determined based on INSPIRE study data and historical data (including CONTEMPO Registry Study data, which evaluated patients closely matched to INSPIRE inclusion criteria). 10 , 12 , 13 , 15 A sample size of up to 35 patients was selected to make it highly probable that there would be 10 patients in each study arm. Based on AIS conversion rates from INSPIRE (44%) and best natural history data available at the time of study initiation (SCI Model Systems and European Multicenter Study about SCI registries; both 16%), the study was underpowered. 10 , 13 , 15\n\nThe ISNCSCI examination performed within 8 hours of surgery was used as the baseline for ISNCSCI endpoints, and the screening MRI was used as the baseline for changes in spinal cord anatomy. Patients who did not complete the 6-month primary endpoint follow-up visit were considered not to have an improvement in the primary efficacy analysis. No other missing data were imputed. No formal statistical hypothesis testing was performed because of the small sample size. Descriptive statistics were used for all efficacy and safety analyses. Data were analyzed using SAS® for Windows® version 9.4.

Individual anonymized patient data supporting this study cannot be made available because participants did not consent to have their data shared.\n\nRESULTS\n\nPatients and Follow-up\n\nTwenty patients (of 20 screened) were enrolled at 11 study sites between May 21, 2019, and June 1, 2022 (Figure 2 ). Target enrollment was reached with 10 patients assigned to each treatment group, and the 6-month primary endpoint follow-up analysis was completed as planned. With US FDA approval, subsequent follow-up of included patients ceased on September 30, 2023, and the study was terminated by the sponsor because of not meeting its primary endpoint as of December 31, 2023.\n\nDemographics and clinical characteristics seemed to be balanced across treatment groups (Table 2 ). All patients had successful surgery according to their treatment arm, and there were no major protocol violations; therefore, all randomized patients were included in the Safety, Intent-to-Treat, and Primary Endpoint Analysis Sets. Protocol deviations are detailed in Supplemental Digital Content 1 ( http://links.lww.com/NEU/E475 ). Median time from injury to start of surgery was 29.9 hours (range, 9.3-104.4 hours) for the NSS group and 20.6 hours (range, 7.0-89.7 hours) for the control group, with 40% (4/10) and 60% (6/10) of patients undergoing spine surgery <24 hours after injury, respectively. Intraoperative ultrasound confirmed the contusion size and location in 100% (8/8) and 80% (4/5) of patients with available data, respectively. NSS-treated patients received a 6 mm (n = 1), 8 mm (n = 4), or 10 mm (n = 5) scaffold.\n\nPrimary Endpoint\n\nThe proportion of patients with an improvement of ≥1 AIS grade at the 6-month follow-up visit was 20% in the NSS group (2/10 patients; both AIS C) and 30% in the control group (3/10 patients; AIS B [n = 2] and AIS C [n = 1]).\n\nSecondary Endpoints\n\nAIS grades in individual patients are presented in Table 3 . In the NSS group (N = 10), 1 patient each first converted to AIS C by 3 and 6 months, respectively, both by obtaining voluntary anal contraction. In the control group (N = 10), 2 patients were AIS B at hospital discharge because of the presence of deep anal pressure, including 1 patient who improved to AIS C at 3 and 6 months because of the additional presence of voluntary anal contraction, and 1 patient converted to AIS B at 6 months because of the presence of deep anal pressure. An additional control group patient was AIS B at hospital discharge but was AIS A at subsequent assessments. The remaining ISNCSCI secondary endpoints are presented in Table 4 , with further detail provided in Supplemental Digital Content 1 ( http://links.lww.com/NEU/E475 ).\n\nAmong NSS and control group patients with available data (n = 7 for each group), intraparenchymal spinal cord cysts were documented at 6 months postsurgery in 2 (29%) and 3 (43%) patients, respectively (further details are provided in Supplemental Digital Content 1 [ http://links.lww.com/NEU/E475 ]). There was no evidence of spinal cord adhesion in either treatment group.\n\nSafety\n\nSafety events are summarized in Table 5 , with further detail provided in Supplemental Digital Content 1 ( http://links.lww.com/NEU/E475 ). Most adverse events (AEs) were of mild or moderate severity (60/68 events [88%] in the NSS group and 107/122 events [88%] in the control group). The most common AEs by Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities preferred term (defined as those occurring in ≥30% of patients in either the NSS group [N = 10] or control group [N = 10]) were urinary tract infection (60% vs 40%), nausea (0 vs 30%), pulmonary embolism (10% vs 30%), muscle spasms (30% vs 30%), pyrexia (10% vs 50%), deep vein thrombosis (10% vs 40%), hypokalemia (10% vs 30%), and decubitus ulcer (30% vs 10%).\n\nSafety events meeting the criteria for study stopping rules were reported in 2 (20%) and 3 (30%) patients in the NSS and control groups, respectively. These patients remained on study at data cut-off, and the Data and Safety Monitoring Board reviewed all study patients and did not recommend stopping the trial at any point. One NSS-treated patient had ascending NLI of 6 levels to T6 at hospital discharge, which returned to within 2 levels of baseline at subsequent visits. Another patient had ascending NLI of 9 levels to C2 at 6 months. The examination documented decreased light touch sensation at the C4 dermatome, with normal pinprick sensation, which normalized and was most likely due to left clavicle surgery. In the control group, 1 patient had an ascending NLI of 3 levels to T2 at hospital discharge, another patient had an ascending NLI of 3 levels to T1 at hospital discharge and 7 levels to C5 at 6 months, and a third patient had an ascending NLI of 6 levels to C5 at both hospital discharge and 3 months combined with a 20-point and 15-point deterioration in upper extremity motor score at these time points, respectively.\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nKey Results\n\nThe INSPIRE 2.0 study did not meet its primary endpoint, which was assessed by the proportion of patients with thoracic AIS A SCI who underwent acute NSS implantation having an improvement of ≥1 AIS grade at 6 months postsurgery compared with the control group (20% vs 30%). However, the device had no apparent safety concerns because there were no serious or unanticipated adverse device effects (ADEs).\n\nInterpretation\n\nNeurological improvement after NSS implantation was less dramatic in this study than in the previously reported INSPIRE study (6-month AIS conversion rates were 20% [2/10 randomized patients] and 44% [7/16 patients who completed 6-month follow-up], respectively). 10 , 11 Conversely, the control group seemed to overperform relative to natural history in patients with thoracic complete SCI (6-month AIS conversion rate 30% [3/10 randomized patients] vs AIS conversion rates of 14%-21% [follow-up duration varied across studies]). 12 - 15\n\nOf note, 2 of the 3 control group patients who had improvement in AIS grade at 6 months were graded AIS B at hospital discharge, which was an earlier timepoint than AIS conversions reported among NSS-treated patients in either of the INSPIRE studies. 10 , 11 Both patients underwent surgery within 24 hours of injury (11 and 21 hours, respectively). This result may highlight a conundrum of acute SCI clinical trials. While there is a push for earlier surgery, 17 it is important to consider that early examinations can be deceiving. 18 , 19 Interpretation of INSPIRE 2.0 study data may be further limited by 2 patients (20%) in each treatment group not completing their 6-month primary endpoint ISNCSCI examinations (including 1 patient each because of COVID-19 restrictions).\n\nNLI changes were generally within the range of what would be expected based on natural history and INSPIRE study data, 10 - 13 , 15 , 20 and there was no discernible difference between treatment groups. Owing to the severe neurologic injury from great mechanical forces, spontaneous motor recovery is uncommon in patients with thoracic AIS A SCI. 12 , 13 , 15 , 21 In this study, 1 patient in each treatment group had lower extremity motor score improvement, with the greatest improvement noted at 6 months (NSS: 19 points; control: 2 points).\n\nAEs were consistent for the injury and across treatment groups. 22 Replicating the results from INSPIRE, no unanticipated or serious ADEs were reported. 10 , 11 Longer-term data from INSPIRE showed that the NSS safety profile was stable through 24 months postimplantation and void of long-term neurological issues. 11 The INSPIRE studies have firmly established the safety of the NSS and its implantation procedure. 10 , 11 Based on learnings from INSPIRE, inclusion criteria for INSPIRE 2.0 were modified to prevent critically ill patients from being operated on prematurely, and a pulmonary prophylaxis protocol was implemented. The early complications seen in INSPIRE, 10 , 11 unrelated to the NSS or its implantation procedure, were not observed in INSPIRE 2.0 despite most patients (15/20 patients [75%]) heading to the operating room within 48 hours of injury.\n\nGeneralizability\n\nTo our knowledge, this is the first randomized clinical trial of a biomaterial placed in an acutely injured spinal cord. From a safety standpoint, there does not seem to be any serious complications related to NSS implantation within the spinal cord. It is acknowledged that it will likely take more than one treatment modality to make a significant impact on outcomes in patients with severe traumatic SCI, eg, neuromodulation, pharmaceutical agents, cell-based therapies, or direct intervention at the site of injury, such as NSS implantation. 2 , 23 Importantly, this study conducted by experienced spinal neurosurgeons showed that myelotomy can be performed safely in patients with complete (AIS A) injuries.\n\nLimitations\n\nThe main limitation of this study was the small sample size. Ideally, clinical trials are enrolled to statistical significance, but this is difficult to achieve for traumatic SCI studies because of the inherent patient enrollment challenges and associated costs. 12 , 24 - 26 SOC spine surgery was considered the only appropriate choice for the control group by the US FDA. Double blinding was not feasible; however, patients and assessors performing follow-up ISNCSCI examinations were blinded to treatment group allocation to minimize potential bias. While ISNCSCI training was mandated and study sites were advised to use consistent assessors throughout the study, inter-rater variability cannot be ruled out.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nIn this small randomized controlled trial, implantation of an intraparenchymal bioresorbable scaffold did not produce probable clinical benefit in patients with thoracic complete (AIS A) SCI. While this result is disappointing, the procedure's safety profile remains acceptable, thus supporting the results of previous studies and demonstrating the feasibility of performing a myelotomy on an acutely injured spinal cord without causing serious neurological deterioration.",
