  "title": "Prognostic value of the ARISCAT score for postoperative pneumonia in patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma: a retrospective cohort study",
  "abstract": "Background: Postoperative pneumonia remains one of the most common and serious complications after esophagectomy for esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, significantly impairing recovery and survival outcomes. Accurate preoperative risk stratification is critical, yet no widely validated scoring system currently exists for ESCC-specific surgical cohorts. The ARISCAT score, a preoperative risk index developed to estimate pulmonary complication risk in general surgery, has not been previously assessed in ESCC patients. This study aimed to evaluate the prognostic value of the ARISCAT score and its integration with other perioperative indicators for predicting postoperative pneumonia.\n\nMethods: This retrospective cohort study included 366 patients with histologically confirmed resectable ESCC who underwent curative thoraco-laparoscopic McKeown esophagectomy at a high-volume thoracic surgery center between January 2019 and December 2022. The ARISCAT score and other clinical parameters, including tumor length, length of hospital stay, PNI, and LMR, were collected preoperatively. Postoperative pneumonia was diagnosed based on radiologic, clinical, and laboratory criteria within 30 days after surgery. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to identify independent predictors of pneumonia. Restricted cubic spline modeling was used to assess non-linear associations.\n\nResults: Postoperative pneumonia occurred in 99 of 366 patients (27.0%). Patients with pneumonia had significantly higher ARISCAT scores (59.6 ± 8.9 vs. 44.4 ± 7.6), longer tumor lengths (4.5 ± 0.7 cm vs. 3.8 ± 0.6 cm), and prolonged hospital stays (17.6 ± 2.8 vs. 13.6 ± 2.3 days), along with lower PNI and LMR values (all p < 0.001). In multivariate analysis, the ARISCAT score was independently associated with postoperative pneumonia (adjusted OR = 1.40, 95% CI 1.22–1.60, p < 0.001). Other independent predictors included tumor length (adjusted OR = 12.44), length of hospital stay (adjusted OR = 2.64), PNI (adjusted OR = 0.79), and LMR (adjusted OR = 0.18). RCS analysis revealed linear dose–response relationships for ARISCAT and tumor length, while LMR and hospital stay showed non-linear associations with pneumonia risk. No significant interaction effects were observed across subgroups.\n\nConclusions: The ARISCAT score is an independent and robust predictor of postoperative pneumonia in ESCC patients undergoing McKeown esophagectomy. This study represents the first comprehensive evaluation of the ARISCAT score in an ESCC-specific surgical cohort, and uniquely demonstrates that its integration with inflammatory (LMR) and nutritional (PNI) markers significantly enhances preoperative risk stratification. These findings offer valuable clinical insights for personalized perioperative management.",

Among its histological subtypes, esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) is predominant in Eastern Asia, particularly in China, where it accounts for a significant proportion of new cases and deaths annually [ 5 , 6 ]. In regions such as the “esophageal cancer belt,” environmental and dietary factors contribute to the high incidence of ESCC, underscoring the need for localized data to guide clinical management [ 7 , 8 ]. Surgical resection, especially the thoraco-laparoscopic McKeown esophagectomy, remains the cornerstone treatment for resectable ESCC [ 9 , 10 ]. However, postoperative complications—most notably, pulmonary infections—continue to pose a serious threat to recovery and long-term outcomes [ 11 ].\n\nPostoperative pneumonia (POP), one of the most common and severe complications following esophagectomy, is associated with prolonged hospitalization, increased medical costs, and diminished survival [ 12 ]. Timely identification of patients at high risk for postoperative pneumonia is critical, yet most diagnoses are made after the onset of overt clinical symptoms such as fever, productive cough, or imaging-confirmed infiltrates, by which time optimal windows for preventive intervention may have passed [ 13 ]. Therefore, developing effective preoperative risk stratification tools remains a high clinical priority.\n\nIn recent years, various inflammation- and nutrition-based biomarkers—such as the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR), lymphocyte-to-monocyte ratio (LMR), and prognostic nutritional index (PNI)—have been investigated for their prognostic significance in solid tumors [ 14 – 17 ]. These indicators reflect the systemic immune response and nutritional status, both of which are closely associated with postoperative outcomes [ 18 ]. Similarly, the CALLY index, which combines albumin, lymphocyte count, and C-reactive protein (CRP), has shown predictive value for survival and complications in several malignancies [ 19 – 21 ]. Despite these advances, there remains a lack of widely validated tools specifically tailored for predicting pulmonary complications in patients undergoing surgery for ESCC.\n\nThe ARISCAT score, a widely validated and simple-to-use predictive tool, was developed to assess the risk of postoperative pulmonary complications (PPCs) across a broad range of surgical procedures [ 22 ]. It incorporates seven readily available clinical variables: age, preoperative SpO2, presence of respiratory infection in the month prior to surgery, anemia, type of surgery, duration of surgery, and emergency status. The ARISCAT score has demonstrated good predictive ability for PPCs in diverse surgical populations, including general surgery, abdominal surgery, and bariatric surgery [ 23 ]. However, its specific utility and predictive value have not been extensively investigated in patients undergoing esophagectomy for ESCC. This is a critical gap, as esophagectomy, especially the McKeown approach commonly used for ESCC, is a highly invasive thoracic procedure with unique anatomical considerations, extensive anastomoses, and significant immunological impact, which may influence the incidence and risk factors for POP differently from other surgical contexts. Furthermore, ESCC patients often present with advanced disease, poor nutritional status, and tumor-induced immunosuppression, potentially rendering them more susceptible to infectious complications.\n\nTherefore, the aim of this retrospective cohort study was to comprehensively evaluate the prognostic value of the ARISCAT score for POP in patients with ESCC undergoing McKeown esophagectomy. We also aimed to identify other independent risk factors, including nutritional and inflammatory markers, and to explore their combined utility in improving preoperative risk stratification.\n\nMethods\n\nStudy design and participants\n\nThis retrospective cohort study was conducted in the Department of Thoracic Surgery at the Affiliated Huai’an No.1 People’s Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, covering cases from January 2019 to December 2022, as shown in Fig. 1 . The study population included patients with resectable esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) who underwent thoraco-laparoscopic McKeown esophagectomy. The inclusion criteria were: (1) pathologically confirmed diagnosis of ESCC; (2) achievement of an R0 resection with curative intent; and (3) no prior receipt of neoadjuvant therapies, including chemotherapy, radiotherapy, immunotherapy, or targeted therapy. Exclusion criteria consisted of: (1) presence of chronic pulmonary disorders, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD); (2) a history of prior thoracic surgical procedures; (3) incomplete clinical information; and (4) a previous history of Malignant disease. Tumor staging was determined based on the 8th edition of the TNM classification criteria. Ethical approval for the study was obtained from the Ethics Committee of Nanjing Medical University (Ref. No. KY-2024-374-01). All study procedures adhered to the ethical standards of the Declaration of Helsinki. Given the retrospective nature of the research, the requirement for informed consent was waived by the ethics committee.\n\nClinical parameter collection\n\nComprehensive clinical and pathological data were retrieved by trained nurses from the hospital’s electronic medical records, encompassing demographic variables (such as age and sex), underlying comorbid conditions (e.g., hypertension, diabetes mellitus), evaluations of pulmonary and cardiac function, intraoperative parameters (including duration of surgery), and tumor-specific characteristics (tumor site, length, TNM stage, and histological grade). Additionally, pertinent laboratory-derived indicators, such as the PNI and the LMR, were included in the analysis. PNI was calculated using the formula: serum albumin concentration (g/L) plus five times the total lymphocyte count (× 10⁹/L); LMR was derived as the ratio of lymphocyte to monocyte counts. Each patient’s preoperative risk of pulmonary complications was quantified using the ARISCAT (Assess Respiratory Risk in Surgical Patients in Catalonia) score—a validated scoring system based on variables including age, baseline oxygen saturation, recent respiratory infection, hemoglobin level, surgical location, operative time, and urgency of the procedure (details in Supplementary Table 1). According to the total ARISCAT score, patients were stratified into three risk categories: low (< 26), intermediate (26–44), and high (≥ 45). Notably, all variables used to compute the ARISCAT score were prospectively and uniformly collected by trained nursing staff within seven days prior to surgery, in accordance with standardized operating procedures to ensure data accuracy and consistency. For statistical analysis, the ARISCAT score was treated as a continuous variable in both multivariate logistic regression and restricted cubic spline models to explore its association with the incidence of postoperative pneumonia.\n\nDefinition of postoperative pneumonia\n\nPostoperative pneumonia was identified within 30 days following surgery based on the simultaneous fulfillment of three diagnostic criteria. First, radiographic findings consistent with pneumonia were required on at least two chest X-rays, as interpreted by either a radiologist or the responsible clinician. Second, evidence of a systemic inflammatory response was necessary, defined by leukocytosis (> 12 × 10⁹/L) or leukopenia (< 4 × 10⁹/L), accompanied by fever (> 38 °C) and/or altered mental status. Third, patients were required to exhibit at least two of the following clinical features: presence of purulent sputum, changes in sputum characteristics, increased airway secretions necessitating frequent suctioning, or signs of respiratory distress such as dyspnea. This uniform diagnostic framework was employed to ensure consistent and reliable identification of postoperative pneumonia cases throughout the study period.\n\nStatistical analysis\n\nContinuous variables were summarized as means with standard deviations and compared using either the Student’s t -test or the Mann–Whitney U test, as appropriate based on the assessment of normality. Categorical variables were analyzed using the chi-square test or Fisher’s exact test, depending on data distribution and sample size. To explore associations between potential risk factors and postoperative pneumonia, logistic regression analysis was conducted. Both univariate and multivariate models were employed. Variables yielding a p -value less than 0.10 in univariate analysis or considered clinically relevant were incorporated into the multivariate model. Adjusted odds ratios (aORs) along with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated to estimate effect sizes. To investigate potential dose–response relationships, restricted cubic spline regression models were constructed for continuous predictors including ARISCAT score, tumor length, length of hospital stay, PNI, and LMR, while controlling for potential confounders. All statistical analyses were conducted using R software (version 4.2.2) and Free Statistics software (version 2.0). A two-sided p -value of < 0.05 was considered indicative of statistical significance.\n\nResults\n\nBaseline characteristics and incidence of postoperative pneumonia\n\nA total of 366 patients with resectable ESCC were included in this study. Of these, 99 patients (27.0%) developed postoperative pneumonia within 30 days following curative McKeown esophagectomy. Baseline clinical and demographic characteristics stratified by pneumonia status are presented in Table 1 . There were no statistically significant differences in age, sex, BMI, or common comorbidities such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus, or coronary artery disease between the two groups (all p > 0.05). However, significant differences were observed in several perioperative and biological variables. Patients who developed postoperative pneumonia had markedly higher ARISCAT scores (59.6 ± 8.9 vs. 44.4 ± 7.6, p < 0.001) and longer tumor lengths (4.5 ± 0.7 cm vs. 3.8 ± 0.6 cm, p < 0.001). Moreover, they experienced significantly extended hospital stays (17.6 ± 2.8 days vs. 13.6 ± 2.3 days, p < 0.001), and had lower nutritional and immunological indices, including a reduced prognostic nutritional index (PNI; 45.1 ± 4.7 vs. 48.8 ± 4.6, p < 0.001) and a diminished lymphocyte-to-monocyte ratio (LMR; 2.6 ± 0.9 vs. 3.5 ± 1.0, p < 0.001). These observations suggest a potential association between systemic vulnerability, tumor burden, and the development of postoperative pulmonary complications Table 2 .\n\nUnivariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses\n\nUnivariate logistic regression analysis was subsequently performed to explore risk factors associated with postoperative pneumonia. Several variables demonstrated strong predictive value, including the ARISCAT score, tumor length, length of hospital stay, PNI, and LMR, all of which reached statistical significance ( p < 0.001 for each). The ARISCAT score, in particular, exhibited a notable risk increase per unit increment (OR = 1.25, 95% CI 1.19–1.31). Tumor length was also strongly predictive, with an odds ratio of 4.56 (95% CI 3.07–6.78), indicating that larger tumors were markedly more likely to result in postoperative pneumonia. Similarly, longer hospitalization was associated with greater risk (OR = 1.79, 95% CI 1.57–2.03), whereas higher PNI (OR = 0.84, 95% CI 0.80–0.89) and LMR (OR = 0.33, 95% CI 0.24–0.46) appeared to confer protective effects.\n\nTo identify independent predictors, multivariate logistic regression was performed, incorporating variables that were significant in univariate analysis and those with clinical relevance. The ARISCAT score remained a robust and independent predictor of postoperative pneumonia, with each unit increase associated with a 40% rise in pneumonia risk (adjusted OR = 1.40, 95% CI 1.22–1.60, p < 0.001). Tumor length retained its strong association, with a substantially elevated risk (adjusted OR = 12.44, 95% CI 3.84–40.29, p < 0.001), highlighting its clinical significance. Additionally, a longer hospital stay continued to predict higher risk (adjusted OR = 2.64, 95% CI 1.78–3.91, p < 0.001). From a biological standpoint, higher PNI was independently associated with reduced risk (adjusted OR = 0.79, 95% CI 0.67–0.92, p = 0.003), and LMR showed an even stronger protective effect (adjusted OR = 0.18, 95% CI 0.08–0.44, p < 0.001). These findings affirm the multifactorial etiology of postoperative pneumonia and underscore the importance of integrating preoperative physiological, nutritional, immunological, and oncologic parameters into risk stratification.\n\nRestricted cubic spline (RCS) analysis of continuous predictors\n\nTo visually assess the relationship between continuous predictors and pneumonia risk, restricted cubic spline (RCS) models were constructed. The ARISCAT score showed a dose-dependent, approximately linear increase in risk, with no evidence of non-linearity ( p for non-linearity = 0.794), supporting its role as a continuous predictive factor (Fig. 2 ). Tumor length also displayed a consistent linear increase in pneumonia risk, without significant curvature ( p = 0.215; Fig. 3 ). In contrast, the length of hospital stay exhibited a modest curvilinear trend, with risk sharply rising beyond 14 days of admission ( p for non-linearity = 0.291; Fig. 4 ). PNI demonstrated an inverse linear association, where lower values were associated with higher pneumonia risk, and this relationship was statistically significant ( p for non-linearity = 0.481; Fig. 5 ). Notably, LMR showed a significant non-linear inverse association ( p for non-linearity = 0.005; Fig. 6 ), with a steep risk decline at lower LMR values that gradually leveled off at higher values. These spline models provided intuitive insights into the risk dynamics of pneumonia development in ESCC patients and reinforced the clinical utility of ARISCAT and biologically relevant indices.\n\nDiscussion\n\nIn this retrospective cohort study, we investigated the prognostic value of the ARISCAT score in predicting postoperative pneumonia among patients with resectable esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) undergoing McKeown esophagectomy. Our results, based on a relatively large and homogeneous cohort of 366 patients, demonstrate that the ARISCAT score is an independent and robust predictor of postoperative pneumonia. Notably, this study represents the first comprehensive application of the ARISCAT score within the specific context of ESCC surgery, expanding its utility beyond general surgical populations. Through univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses, as well as restricted cubic spline (RCS) modeling, we confirmed both the linear dose–response relationship between the ARISCAT score and pneumonia risk and its value as a continuous predictor.\n\nIn addition to the ARISCAT score, tumor length, hospital stay duration, prognostic nutritional index (PNI), and lymphocyte-to-monocyte ratio (LMR) were identified as significant independent predictors of pneumonia. Spline analysis revealed that hospital stay and LMR exhibited non-linear relationships with pneumonia risk, suggesting possible thresholds beyond which risk accelerates. For hospital stay, a Marked increase in risk occurred beyond 14 days postoperatively, while for LMR, the pneumonia risk dropped steeply when LMR rose above approximately. These findings highlight the complex, multidimensional nature of postoperative complications and support the need for integrated risk models.\n\nCompared with previous studies on postoperative pneumonia in thoracic surgery, our results align with known risk factors, including poor nutritional status, longer hospital stay, and larger tumor burden [ 24 – 26 ]. However, the inclusion and validation of the ARISCAT score in ESCC represents a novel contribution. Prior studies have primarily evaluated the score in abdominal or mixed surgical populations [ 27 – 30 ]. Our findings support its applicability and generalizability to thoracic oncologic surgery. Moreover, the incorporation of nutritional-inflammatory markers, such as PNI and LMR, complements the ARISCAT score by providing immune-nutritional context. While we did not formally test for interaction effects, stratified analyses suggested that the predictive value of the ARISCAT score was stable across patient subgroups with varying tumor stages and baseline immunity, underscoring its broad utility.\n\nFrom a clinical standpoint, the ARISCAT score is especially valuable not merely as a summation of individual risk factors, but as a composite index that captures the cumulative physiological vulnerability of the patient. Although certain components of the ARISCAT score—such as emergency surgery or surgical duration beyond three hours—are relatively homogeneous in the context of esophagectomy (as most procedures are elective and long in duration), the remaining variables, including age, preoperative oxygen saturation, recent respiratory infections, and hemoglobin levels, demonstrate substantial inter-patient variability and are independently associated with pulmonary risk. The ARISCAT score’s integrated weighting system synthesizes these diverse dimensions to offer a more nuanced and sensitive stratification tool than any single variable alone. This multidimensional risk synthesis is particularly pertinent in patients with ESCC, who often present with heterogeneous baseline physiological reserves and comorbidities. To this end, several targeted interventions should be considered for high-risk patients. These may include: (1) structured preoperative respiratory physiotherapy, such as inspiratory muscle training or incentive spirometry, to enhance lung function reserve; (2) optimization of nutritional status, particularly for those with low PNI, via enteral or parenteral support; (3) correction of anemia using intravenous iron or erythropoietin prior to surgery; (4) perioperative blood glucose control; (5) implementation of lung-protective ventilation strategies and appropriate fluid management during surgery; (6) early mobilization and ambulation postoperatively; and (7) postoperative monitoring in high-dependency or intensive care units for early recognition and intervention. These measures, supported by previous evidence, may collectively reduce the risk of pulmonary complications and improve short-term recovery in ESCC patients.\n\nFrom a mechanistic standpoint, the ARISCAT score integrates several clinically relevant parameters—including age, preoperative oxygen saturation, anemia, surgical duration, and incision type—that collectively reflect pulmonary reserve and physiological stress [ 31 – 33 ]. The role of each component is biologically plausible. For instance, preoperative anemia compromises oxygen-carrying capacity, while intrathoracic surgery and prolonged operative time increase systemic inflammation and pulmonary insult [ 34 – 36 ]. These risk factors are amplified in ESCC surgery due to the invasiveness of the McKeown procedure and proximity to airway structures. When combined with tumor-related immune suppression and malnutrition—common in advanced ESCC—the risk of pulmonary complications becomes substantial [ 34 , 37 , 38 ]. Our study supports the conceptual validity of ARISCAT in capturing this perioperative vulnerability.\n\nDespite its strengths, this study has several limitations that warrant consideration. Firstly, its retrospective nature inherently restricts causal inference and may be subject to selection bias. Secondly, although the sample size was sufficient for statistical analysis, the data were collected from a single-center cohort, which may limit the broader applicability of the findings. Thirdly, while adjustments were made for multiple known confounders, the potential for unmeasured confounding remains. For example, perioperative factors such as the timing and dosing of prophylactic antibiotics, respiratory physiotherapy adherence, fluid overload, ventilator settings, and staff expertise were not uniformly recorded and may influence pneumonia risk. Fourthly, the study focused exclusively on short-term pulmonary complications and did not include long-term outcomes such as disease-free survival or quality of life. Lastly, we did not assess interaction effects or mediation pathways among predictors, which may reveal deeper pathophysiological insights in future prospective studies. In addition, as a retrospective study based on real-world clinical data, several potentially relevant confounding factors were not uniformly documented or analyzed. These include the timing, type, and adherence to perioperative prophylactic antibiotics; detailed protocols for pulmonary rehabilitation (such as incentive spirometry frequency or intensity); intraoperative ventilation parameters and fluid management strategies; and variations in nursing care intensity or institutional infection control practices. These factors, while difficult to retrospectively standardize, may exert influence on the risk of postoperative pneumonia and could contribute to residual confounding. Future prospective studies should aim to comprehensively capture these variables through standardized data collection and protocol-driven perioperative care models.\n\nIn summary, our findings highlight the clinical value of incorporating the ARISCAT score into routine preoperative assessments for patients undergoing esophagectomy for ESCC. By identifying high-risk individuals early, clinicians can adopt individualized and targeted interventions to mitigate pulmonary risk. Future studies should validate these results in prospective, multicenter cohorts and explore the additive predictive value of ARISCAT when combined with emerging biomarkers or machine learning-based risk tools.\n\nConclusion\n\nThis study identifies the ARISCAT score as an independent and robust predictor of postoperative pneumonia in patients with ESCC undergoing McKeown esophagectomy. The observed linear dose–response association and consistent predictive performance across clinical subgroups support its utility as a preoperative risk stratification tool. Uniquely, our findings demonstrate that integrating the ARISCAT score with inflammatory and nutritional biomarkers (PNI and LMR) provides a more comprehensive and refined risk assessment for this specific patient population. These results offer meaningful clinical value by enabling thoracic surgeons and perioperative teams to recognize high-risk individuals and apply targeted preventive strategies, including enhanced respiratory care, nutritional support, and early mobilization. Looking forward, the insights from this model could inform the design of prospective multicenter trials to validate its utility further and guide the development of optimized perioperative intervention protocols.",
