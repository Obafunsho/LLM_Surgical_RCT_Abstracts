  "title": "Cosmetic outcomes following breast conservation surgery and radiation for multiple ipsilateral breast cancer: Data from the Alliance Z11102 Study",
  "abstract": "Background: The diagnosis of multiple ipsilateral breast cancer (MIBC) is increasing. Historically, the primary treatment for MIBC has been mastectomy due to concerns about in-breast recurrence risk and poor cosmetic outcome. The Alliance Z11102 study prospectively assessed cosmetic outcomes in women with MIBC treated with breast conserving therapy (BCT).\n\nMethods: Z11102 was a multicenter trial enrolling women with 2 or 3 separate sites of biopsy proven malignancy separated by ≥2 cm within the same breast. Cosmetic outcome was a planned secondary end-point. Data were collected with a 4-point cosmesis survey (1=excellent, 4=poor) and the BREAST-Q (scored 0–100). All patients undergoing successful breast-conserving therapy were treated with whole breast radiation. Associations were assessed with chi-square or Fisher’s exact tests as appropriate.\n\nResults: Cosmetic outcome data for 216 eligible women who completed therapy are included in this analysis. Of the 136 patients who completed the survey 2 years postoperatively, 70.6% ( N=96) felt the result was good or excellent while 3.7% (N=5) felt the result was poor. We found no significant differences in patient reported cosmetic outcomes when stratifying by patient age, number of lesions (2 or 3), number of incisions, number of lumpectomies or size of largest area of disease. Mean satisfaction score on the BREAST-Q was 77.2 six months following whole breast radiation and 73.7 three years following surgery.\n\nConclusions: BCT performed for MIBC results in good or excellent cosmesis for the majority of women. From a cosmetic perspective, BCT is a valid surgical approach to women with MIBC.",
