  "abstract": "Introduction: Effective and sustained postoperative analgesia is essential to enhance recovery after video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS). Liposomal bupivacaine, a multivesicular formulation enabling extended local anesthetic release, offers a mechanistic advantage over conventional agents. However, prior comparisons with adjuvant-enhanced regimens such as plain bupivacaine plus dexamethasone were confounded by pharmacological and dose inequivalence. This equivalence-dose randomized controlled trial evaluated whether liposomal bupivacaine provides non-inferior analgesia to the standard combination when administered via rhomboid intercostal block (RIB).\n\nMethods: In this double-blind randomized controlled trial, 90 VATS patients were randomly assigned to receive either: a 20-ml premixed solution containing 93 mg of liposomal bupivacaine combined with 25 mg of plain bupivacaine (liposomal bupivacaine group), or a 20-ml admixture of 105 mg of plain bupivacaine and 5 mg of dexamethasone (plain bupivacaine with dexamethasone group). The primary outcome assessed was the area under the curve (AUC) of the 48-h resting pain numeric rating scale (NRS). Secondary outcomes consisted of opioid consumption, dermatomal spread, and Quality of Recovery-15 scores (QoR-15).\n\nResults: Liposomal bupivacaine was shown to be non-inferior to plain bupivacaine with dexamethasone, with a 48-h NRS AUC of 105.5 ± 13.6 vs . 113.1 ± 16.3 (mean difference − 7.6; 95% CI − 13.9 to − 1.2, upper limit < non-inferiority margin 3.7). Opioid use and dermatomal spread were comparable within the first 24 h ( P > 0.05). There was a notable contrast in sustained dermatome blockade at 48 and 72 h between the two groups ( P < 0.001). The liposomal bupivacaine group demonstrated a significantly reduced opioid requirement ( P = 0.016) within 24–48 h and superior QoR-15 scores on postoperative day 2 (POD2) ( P < 0.001). Safety profiles were comparable, with no between-group differences in postoperative nausea and vomiting or other severe complications ( P > 0.05).\n\nConclusions: Rhomboid intercostal block with liposomal bupivacaine provided similar analgesia to plain bupivacaine with dexamethasone for postoperative pain after VATS.\n\nTrial Registration: The trial was registered on ClinicalTrials.gov ( NCT06392191 ).

The rhomboid intercostal block (RIB), first described by Elsharkawy et al. [ 5 ], has emerged as an innovative ultrasound-guided regional anesthesia technique that strategically targets the interfascial plane between the rhomboid major and intercostal muscles [ 6 ]. This approach provides effective thoracic wall analgesia through precise local anesthetic deposition while circumventing risks associated with surgical site-adjacent blocks, including infection and hematoma formation [ 7 ]. By combining anatomical specificity with enhanced safety margins, RIB demonstrates superior efficacy in multimodal pain management protocols for VATS, potentially reducing opioid dependence and facilitating early recovery without compromising procedural safety [ 8 ].\n\nSingle-injection peripheral nerve blocks offer limited analgesia, with conventional local anesthetics providing less than 24 h of postoperative pain control, requiring strategies to extend their therapeutic effects. Perineural dexamethasone is a key adjuvant with strong clinical evidence. Animal models demonstrate that dexamethasone potentiates nerve blockade by suppressing the release of inflammatory cytokines and inhibiting ectopic neuronal discharge [ 9 ]. Clinically, the addition of 4–8 mg dexamethasone to bupivacaine extends analgesic duration to 30–48 h in human trials [ 10 , 11 ]. This pharmacological synergy has established the bupivacaine–dexamethasone combination as a reference standard for extended-duration nerve blocks.\n\nIn parallel, liposomal bupivacaine, a multivesicular formulation designed for sustained 72-h drug release [ 12 ], represents a promising alternative. While liposomal bupivacaine demonstrates prolonged analgesia in abdominal and orthopedic surgeries [ 13 , 14 ], its comparative efficacy against optimized adjuvant-enhanced conventional local anesthetics remains controversial. Critical analysis reveals fundamental methodological flaws in existing comparisons: prior trials frequently compared unequal total bupivacaine doses (e.g., 133 mg liposomal bupivacaine vs. 75 mg plain bupivacaine + dexamethasone) [ 15 ]. Such pharmacological inequivalence confounds interpretation [ 16 ], as dose-dependent effects on block duration are well documented [ 17 ].\n\nPrevious comparisons with adjuvant-enhanced regimens such as plain bupivacaine plus dexamethasone were confounded by pharmacological and dose inequivalence. Therefore, we conducted an equivalence-dose, randomized controlled trial to assess whether liposomal bupivacaine offers non-inferior analgesia compared to the standard combination when administered via RIB in patients undergoing VATS.\n\nMethods\n\nEthical Approval\n\nThis prospective, randomized controlled trial was approved by the Ethics Committee of the affiliated hospital of Jiaxing University (Ethical number: 2024-KY-226) on 2024-04-01, registered on ClinicalTrials.gov ( NCT06392191 ) on 2024-04-08. Participants provided written informed consent and followed Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) guidelines and the Helsinki Declaration of 1964 and its later amendments.\n\nParticipants\n\nEligible participants were adults aged between 18 and 80 years with an American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status of I–III. All patients were scheduled for elective thoracoscopic lung resection surgery, including wedge resection, segmentectomy, or lobectomy, conducted under general anesthesia. Surgical procedures involved single or three incisions, with an anticipated duration of less than 4 h. Participants were required to have a body mass index (BMI) ranging from 18 to 30 kg/m 2 .\n\nPatients were excluded if they were scheduled for trauma-related or emergency surgery; had New York Heart Association (NYHA) class III or IV heart failure; or had unstable coronary artery disease. Severe renal impairment, defined as an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) < 30 ml/min/1.73 m 2 , and significant hepatic dysfunction, indicated by alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels exceeding twice the upper limit of normal, also constituted exclusion criteria. Patients were not eligible if they had any coagulation disorders or failed to discontinue anticoagulant therapy, including warfarin, rivaroxaban, or dabigatran, according to institutional perioperative protocols. To minimize interindividual variability in baseline nociception and reduce the potential for opioid tolerance, individuals with chronic pain syndromes (e.g., complex regional pain syndrome or reflex sympathetic dystrophy) or long-term opioid use (defined as opioid use for > 3 months or > 5 mg oral morphine equivalents per day for ≥ 1 month) were excluded. Further exclusions included current or recent (within 2 months) alcohol or substance abuse, uncontrolled psychiatric illness (e.g., schizophrenia, severe anxiety disorders), known hypersensitivity to amide-type local anesthetics or any investigational agents, and any contraindications to study medications. Pregnant or breastfeeding women, those planning to conceive during the study period, and individuals unwilling or unable to provide written informed consent were also excluded.\n\nParticipants were withdrawn from the study under several conditions: the occurrence of severe intraoperative complications, including cardiac arrest or significant vascular injury, or if intraoperative blood loss surpassed 800 ml. Additionally, withdrawal was implemented if participants refused postoperative follow-up or necessitated transfer to the intensive care unit (ICU) following surgery.\n\nGeneral Anesthesia Management\n\nA consistent anesthesiology team performed surgeries using a standardized general anesthesia protocol. Standard monitoring equipment was used, with radial artery cannulation performed under ultrasound guidance for continuous blood pressure monitoring.\n\nGeneral anesthesia was induced through the administration of intravenous sufentanil at a dosage of 0.4–0.6 μg/kg, propofol at 2–3 mg/kg, and rocuronium at 0.6–1.0 mg/kg. Following an interval of 3–5 min, a double-lumen endotracheal tube was inserted utilizing direct laryngoscopy. The accurate positioning of the tube was verified via auscultation and capnography. Anesthetic maintenance was achieved using remifentanil at a rate of 0.05–0.2 μg/kg/min and sevoflurane, with dosages adjusted according to the anesthesiologist's clinical discretion to maintain a Bispectral Index (BIS) score within the range of 40–60. Mechanical ventilation was administered utilizing a pressure-controlled volume guarantee mode. For bilateral lung ventilation, the tidal volume was adjusted to 7–8 ml/kg, and the respiratory rate was set at 12–15 breaths per minute, employing a 2 l/min air/oxygen mixture with 70% oxygen concentration. During single-lung ventilation, the tidal volume was decreased to 5–6 ml kg, and the respiratory rate was increased to 15–20 breaths per minute, with 100% oxygen being delivered. End-tidal carbon dioxide (EtCO₂) levels were maintained within the range of 35–45 mmHg, while ensuring that peak airway pressure remained below 35 cm H₂O. Throughout the procedure, hemodynamic parameters were meticulously monitored. An increase in heart rate or blood pressure exceeding 20% of baseline values, after excluding non-analgesic causes, was addressed with administration of intravenous sufentanil at a dosage of 0.1 μg/kg. In instances of bradycardia, defined as a heart rate below 50 bpm, 0.5 mg of atropine was administered. Furthermore, additional vasopressors, including ephedrine or norepinephrine, were employed as necessary to maintain blood pressure within 20% of baseline levels.\n\nUpon completion of the procedure, all patients were relocated to the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) for recovery. In instances where reversal of residual neuromuscular blockade induced by rocuronium was required, atropine at a dosage of 0.01 mg/kg and neostigmine at 0.05 mg/kg were administered. Prophylactic management of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) was achieved through the administration of 4 mg of intravenous ondansetron, administered 30 min prior to the conclusion of the surgical procedure. Upon meeting the standardized discharge criteria from the PACU, defined as an Aldrete recovery score of ≥ 9, patients were transferred to the surgical ward for continued postoperative care.\n\nRegional Anesthesia Technique\n\nFollowing the induction of anesthesia, the patient was positioned in the lateral decubitus orientation to facilitate an ultrasound-guided RIB. The procedure was conducted under aseptic conditions, employing 10% povidone-iodine for skin disinfection. The anesthesiologist utilized a 6–12 MHz micro-convex ultrasound probe (LOGIQ e ultrasound system; Deutschland GmbH & Co. KG, Solingen, Germany) oriented in the oblique sagittal plane along the medial border of the scapula. Critical anatomical landmarks, including the serratus anterior, rhomboid, intercostal muscles, pleura, and lungs, were identified and verified using ultrasound guidance, as illustrated in Fig. 1 . All nerve block procedures were performed by a single anesthesiologist who possesses extensive experience, having conducted over 100 ultrasound-guided RIB procedures.\n\nUtilizing an in-plane technique, a 22-gauge nerve block needle was inserted at the T 5 –T 6 vertebral level. The correct placement was confirmed by the dispersion of 0.5–1 ml of local anesthetic within the targeted fascial plane, as visualized via ultrasound. Upon verification of proper diffusion, the full dose of anesthetic was administered. Participants in the liposomal bupivacaine cohort received 93 mg of liposomal bupivacaine in combination with 25 mg of plain bupivacaine. In contrast, those in the plain bupivacaine with dexamethasone cohort received 105 mg of plain bupivacaine along with 5 mg of dexamethasone. Each milligram of liposomal bupivacaine was equivalent to 1.128 mg of standard bupivacaine [ 18 ]. This combination (93 mg liposomal bupivacaine + 25 mg plain bupivacaine vs. 105 mg plain bupivacaine + 5 mg dexamethasone) was selected based on the pharmacokinetic equivalence of liposomal and plain formulations and to simulate a clinically relevant analgesic profile. The early-onset component (25 mg plain bupivacaine) aimed to ensure intraoperative coverage, while the sustained-release component (liposomal formulation) targeted prolonged postoperative analgesia within an equivalence-dose framework. The total injection volume was standardized at 20 ml for both groups.\n\nUtilizing real-time ultrasound guidance, the anesthesiologist verified the diffusion of the local anesthetic beneath the rhomboid muscle, thereby ensuring comprehensive coverage of the interfascial plane. The anesthetic solution was observed to disperse uniformly along the intended plane, confirming the successful placement of the block.\n\nSurgical Procedure\n\nIn patients undergoing single-port thoracoscopic surgery, a solitary incision measuring 4.0–5.0 cm was created at the 4th or 5th intercostal space along the anterior axillary line. Through this incision, a trocar was introduced, facilitating all surgical maneuvers, including instrumentation and visualization. For patients undergoing the three-port thoracoscopic approach, the primary operative port was strategically positioned at the anterior axillary line within the 3rd or 4th intercostal space, with an incision length ranging from 3.0 to 4.0 cm. The secondary operative port was placed at the posterior axillary line in the 5th or 6th intercostal space, with an incision measuring 1.5 cm. Additionally, the observation port was located at the mid-axillary line in the 7th intercostal space, also featuring an incision length of 1.5 cm. Each incision was strategically outfitted with a trocar to facilitate the insertion of surgical instruments and the endoscopic camera. The meticulous positioning of the ports was crucial for achieving optimal visualization and access during the surgical procedure.\n\nThe decision to employ either single-port or three-port thoracoscopic surgery was contingent upon the complexity of the lung resection and the surgeon's clinical judgment. In all instances, the placement of a chest tube prior to skin closure was standardized to ensure adequate drainage and to support postoperative recovery.\n\nPatient Grouping, Randomization, and Blinding Method\n\nPatient randomization was conducted utilizing a computer-generated sequence from http://www.random.org . To ensure balanced allocation between the liposomal bupivacaine group and the plain bupivacaine with dexamethasone group, block randomization with a block size of four was employed, maintaining an allocation ratio of 1:1. The randomization codes were securely stored and managed by an independent research coordinator who was not involved in clinical care or patient assessment.\n\nTo preserve blinding within the study, the preparation of study medications was conducted by an independent anesthetic nurse in accordance with the randomization code. Due to the opaque nature of liposomal bupivacaine in contrast to the colorless appearance of plain bupivacaine combined with dexamethasone, the syringes containing these medications were coated to obscure their contents. A stringent separation of roles was implemented: individuals tasked with drug preparation were not involved in the administration of nerve blocks, and those responsible for performing the nerve blocks did not engage in anesthesia management or postoperative evaluations. This stringent protocol guaranteed that healthcare providers and researchers responsible for follow-up evaluations remained blinded to group assignments. All nerve blocks were administered post-anesthesia induction, thereby preventing patients from observing the study drug and preserving blinding. The double-blind design was meticulously maintained throughout the study to uphold scientific rigor and minimize potential biases. Regular audits were conducted to ensure compliance with the randomization and blinding protocols.\n\nPain Management and Assessment Protocol\n\nPostoperatively, in the PACU, patients were provided with intravenous patient-controlled analgesia (PCIA) consisting of sufentanil 100 μg and ondansetron 8 mg, diluted to 100 ml with 0.9% saline. The PCIA settings included a self-administered dose of 2 ml, a lockout interval of 15 min, and no continuous basal infusion. Pain intensity was evaluated utilizing the numeric rating scale (NRS), which spans from 0, indicating no pain, to 10, representing the worst pain imaginable. Standardized pain assessments were conducted at intervals of 0.5, 2, 4, 12, 18, 24, 48, and 72 h following tracheal extubation and patient awakening. These specific time points were chosen to effectively capture fluctuations in pain intensity over time. Prior to surgery, patients received education on the correct use of the PCIA to enhance their ability to self-manage pain.\n\nRescue analgesia protocol: patients with significant pain (NRS > 3) were first instructed to administer one dose of PCIA. If pain persisted, a stepwise protocol was followed. For moderate pain (NRS 4–6), 40 mg of parecoxib sodium was administered as needed. For severe pain (NRS 7–10), 10 mg of oxycodone was given as needed. If pain relief remained inadequate despite these measures, rescue analgesia with intravenous hydromorphone (0.5 mg every 15 min, up to a maximum of 1 mg) was provided until adequate pain control was achieved.\n\nOutcome Measures\n\nThe primary outcome of this study was the area under the curve (AUC) of NRS scores at rest, measured 48 h postoperatively. This metric was employed to assess the overall variations in postoperative pain intensity, thereby offering a comprehensive measure of analgesic efficacy. Secondary outcomes encompassed the NRS scores assessed at multiple time intervals up to 72 h following surgery, with analyses conducted using the AUC method. Patient characteristics, the administration of general anesthesia, postoperative sufentanil consumption, the time to first ambulation, and the frequency of rescue analgesia utilization were systematically documented. The sensory blockade area was evaluated at various time intervals within 72 h following surgery utilizing pinprick testing.\n\nThe postoperative recovery process was evaluated utilizing the Quality of Recovery-15 (QoR-15) scale at the preoperative baseline, as well as on postoperative day 1 (POD-1) and day 2 (POD-2). We confirm that permission has been obtained to use QoR-15. Functional recovery metrics encompassed the volume of chest tube drainage, the timing of chest tube removal, the duration of stay in the PACU, and the overall length of hospitalization. Additionally, Systemic inflammation was evaluated by measuring C-reactive protein (CRP) preoperatively (1 day before surgery), and CRP, procalcitonin (PCT), and interleukin-6 (IL-6) on postoperative day 1.\n\nThe occurrence of significant postoperative pulmonary complications (PPCs) was documented within post-surgery. PPCs encompassed respiratory infection, respiratory failure, pleural effusion, atelectasis, pneumothorax, bronchospasm, and hypoxemia, and were categorized as grade II or higher in accordance with the Clavien–Dindo classification [ 4 ].\n\nAdditional postoperative complications were documented, including new-onset atrial fibrillation (NOAF), severe ventricular arrhythmias, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), pulmonary embolism (PE), and intestinal obstruction. The PONV were evaluated using a four-grade scoring system, where 0 represented no symptoms, 1 represented mild nausea, 2 represented severe nausea and vomiting one time, and 3 represented vomiting two times or more and requiring rescue antiemetic metoclopramide 10 mg intravenously. The results of the Pulmonary function tests (PFTs) were conducted using a computerized spirometry system, and results were categorized based on clinical diagnosis and forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) as follows: (1) mild, FEV1 ≥ 80% predicted; (2) moderate, FEV1 50–79% predicted; (3) severe, FEV1 30–49% predicted; and (4) very severe, FEV1 < 30% predicted.\n\nSample Size Calculation\n\nThe sample size for this study was determined using PASS 15.0 software (NCSS, LLC., Kaysville, Utah, USA). A preliminary power analysis was performed under a non-inferiority framework, concentrating on the AUC of NRS scores at rest during the first 48 h postoperatively, which served as the primary outcome measure. Preliminary data from 20 patients ( n = 10 per group, unpublished) revealed AUC values of 111.1 ± 18.0 for the liposomal bupivacaine group and 120.1 ± 18.3 for the plain bupivacaine with dexamethasone group. To determine the non-inferiority margin, a clinically significant difference was defined as one-fifth of the standard deviation of the AUC scores derived from the preliminary dataset, yielding a margin of 3.7. This threshold was chosen to ensure that any observed differences would fall within a range considered clinically acceptable.\n\nWith a one-sided type I error rate of 0.05 and a statistical power of 90%, it was calculated that a sample size of 36 patients per group was necessary to establish non-inferiority. To accommodate a potential dropout rate of 20%, the final sample size was adjusted to 90 patients, with 45 individuals allocated to each group.\n\nStatistical Analysis\n\nCategorical variables are presented as numbers and percentages. Continuous variables are presented as the mean ± standard deviation or median (interquartile range [IQR]). The chi-square test or Fisher’s exact test was used to compare categorical variables and Student’s t test or Mann–Whitney U test was used for continuous variables, based on the normality of the data. The non-inferiority analysis concentrated on evaluating the mean difference and the 95% confidence interval (CI) of the AUC for NRS scores between groups, with a comparison of the CI limits against the predefined non-inferiority margin [ 19 ]. The determination to reject the null hypothesis was based on a visual assessment of whether the lower limit of the CI exceeded the non-inferiority margin.\n\nTo determine whether the surgical approach (single-port vs. three-port VATS) modified the treatment effect, a general linear model (GLM) was constructed incorporating an interaction term between group allocation and surgical approach. A significant interaction ( P < 0.05) was considered evidence of effect modification, in which case subgroup analyses were performed to evaluate between-group differences within each surgical stratum. If no interaction was detected, stratified analyses were not pursued. Statistical analyses were conducted utilizing SPSS software, version 25.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA), in conjunction with GraphPad Prism, version 8.0. A P value of less than 0.05 was considered indicative of statistical significance.\n\nResults\n\nBaseline Characteristics\n\nA total of 90 patients were recruited for the study and randomly allocated into two groups, with 45 patients in each group. Prior to the unsealing of the randomization envelopes, one patient assigned to the plain bupivacaine with dexamethasone group was excluded due to postoperative transfer to the ICU. Consequently, the final analysis comprised 44 patients in the plain bupivacaine with dexamethasone group and 45 patients in the liposomal bupivacaine group. The process of patient randomization and exclusion is depicted in the CONSORT flow diagram (Fig. 2 ). The baseline characteristics, encompassing both demographic and clinical variables, were similar between the two groups, as detailed in Table 1 .\n\nThe AUC of NRS Scores Over Time at Rest and on Movement\n\nThe mean 48 h AUC of NRS scores was 105.5 ± 13.6 in the liposomal bupivacaine group, whereas it was 113.1 ± 16.3 in the plain bupivacaine with dexamethasone group. This resulted in a mean difference of − 7.6 (95% confidence interval [CI]: − 13.9 to − 1.2). Notably, the upper limit of the 95% CI was below the predefined non-inferiority margin of 3.7, thereby confirming the non-inferiority of liposomal bupivacaine, as shown in Fig. 3 .\n\nNo significant interaction was observed between group allocation and surgical approach ( P > 0.05), as shown in Supplementary Material, indicating that incision type did not modify the treatment effect. Therefore, subgroup analysis by surgical approach was not performed. No statistically significant differences were observed between the two groups in terms of the AUC of NRS scores at 12 and 24 h, both at rest and during movement ( P > 0.05). However, at 48 and 72 h, the group administered plain bupivacaine with dexamethasone demonstrated a significantly greater AUC of NRS scores compared to the group receiving liposomal bupivacaine, under both resting and movement conditions ( P < 0.05), as shown in Table 2 .\n\nDermatomal Spread of the Blockades in the Medial-Scapular Area\n\nAt 0.5, 2, 12, 18, and 24 h postoperatively, the dermatomal counts between the two groups were comparable, with no statistically significant differences observed (all P > 0.05). At 48 h, the liposomal bupivacaine group had a median dermatomal spread of 4.0 [3.5–5.0], while plain bupivacaine with dexamethasone group had 0.0 [0.0–1.0] ( P < 0.001). At 72 h, the liposomal bupivacaine group showed 2.0 [2.0–3.0] spread, compared to 0.0 [0.0–0.0] in the plain bupivacaine with dexamethasone group ( P < 0.001), as shown in the Supplementary Material.\n\nOpioid Consumption, Quality of Recovery-15 Score\n\nNo statistically significant difference in opioid consumption was observed between the groups during the surgical procedure and the postoperative period from 0 to 24 h ( P > 0.05). Conversely, during the 24–48 h postoperative interval, opioid usage was significantly elevated in the group receiving plain bupivacaine with dexamethasone compared to the group administered liposomal bupivacaine ( P = 0.016), as shown in Table 3 . At baseline, the overall QoR-15 scores, as well as the scores for individual items, did not significantly differ between the two groups ( P > 0.05). On POD 1, the group receiving liposomal bupivacaine demonstrated significantly higher overall QoR-15 scores compared to the group receiving plain bupivacaine with dexamethasone (114.0 ± 7.4 vs . 108.5 ± 5.0; P < 0.001). On POD 2, the QoR-15 scores were significantly higher in the group receiving liposomal bupivacaine compared to the group administered plain bupivacaine with dexamethasone (126.4 ± 4.6 vs . 118.0 ± 4.6; P < 0.001), as shown in Supplementary Material.\n\nAnesthetic Drug Dosage, Time-Dependent Outcomes, and Inflammatory Markers Formatted\n\nNo statistically significant differences were found between groups in propofol induction doses, nerve block procedure duration, PACU stay, extubation time, chest tube removal, ambulation, procedure duration, anesthesia duration, hospital stay, or rescue analgesia incidence (all P > 0.05). Refer to Table 3 for detailed data. Preoperative CRP levels did not significantly differ between the two groups ( P > 0.05). On POD-1, both CRP and PCT levels remained statistically similar ( P > 0.05). In contrast, IL-6 levels were significantly elevated in the liposomal bupivacaine group compared to the plain bupivacaine with dexamethasone group ( P = 0.002), as shown in Supplementary Material.\n\nPONV, Pulmonary-Related Complications, and Other Adverse Events\n\nThe incidence of PONV did not exhibit a statistically significant difference between the group receiving liposomal bupivacaine and the group administered plain bupivacaine with dexamethasone ( P = 0.930), as shown in Table 4 . PPCs occurred in 35.6% of liposomal bupivacaine and 38.6% of plain bupivacaine with dexamethasone patients ( P = 0.764). Specific PPC rates: respiratory infections (17.8% vs. 20.5%, P = 0.748), pneumothorax (24.4% vs. 18.2%, P = 0.471), pleural effusion (13.3% vs. 18.2%, P = 0.530), and atelectasis (2.2% vs. 4.5%, P = 0.544). No hypoxemia, bronchospasm, or respiratory failure reported, as shown in Table 5 and Fig. 4 ). NOAF occurred in two patients receiving plain bupivacaine with dexamethasone. DVT was reported in one patient (2.2%) in the liposomal bupivacaine group and three patients (6.8%) in the plain bupivacaine with dexamethasone group ( P = 0.295). No severe ventricular arrhythmias, PE, or intestinal obstructions were detected, as shown in Table 5 .\n\nDiscussion\n\nThis study, employing an innovative equivalence-dose design, systematically evaluated the analgesic efficacy of liposomal bupivacaine versus the conventional bupivacaine–dexamethasone combination in patients undergoing VATS. The findings confirmed the non-inferiority of liposomal bupivacaine to bupivacaine–dexamethasone combination when administered via the RIB.\n\nThis study broadens the application of liposomal bupivacaine to the innovative RIB technique, a fascial block that targets the rhomboid and intercostal muscles, thereby offering coverage of the T 2 –T 9 dermatomes [ 20 ]. The study evaluates the clinical efficacy of liposomal bupivacaine in comparison to equivalent plain bupivacaine combined with dexamethasone in the context of RIB, providing significant clinical insights. Following the methodology outlined by Finnerty et al. [ 21 ], the present study utilized the AUC of the NRS scores over time to assess postoperative pain levels between the two groups, instead of depending on single-point NRS scores. The AUC serves as a more comprehensive metric, as it accounts for uneven data distribution and offers a more precise assessment of the overall pain experience over a specified time period. The findings indicated no statistically significant differences in AUC values between the two groups during both rest and movement at 12 and 24 h postoperatively. However, at 48 and 72 h postoperatively, the group receiving liposomal bupivacaine demonstrated significantly lower AUC values during both rest and movement, alongside a marked reduction in opioid consumption between 24 and 48 h. These findings indicate that liposomal bupivacaine provides enhanced and extended analgesic effects.\n\nAlthough the total dose of bupivacaine in the liposomal group was slightly higher (118 vs. 105 mg), the following evidence supports the validity of the equivalence-based comparison: (1) The pharmacokinetic characteristics of the additional 25 mg of conventional bupivacaine limit its effect to the early postoperative phase [ 22 ]; after 24 h post-surgery, the analgesic effect was entirely attributed to the long-acting liposomal bupivacaine, with statistical differences between the two groups only emerging after 24 h. (2) Liposomal bupivacaine has an onset time of approximately 30 min, and the mixed-drug strategy leverages a “rapid onset and sustained release” synergistic mechanism, ensuring intraoperative hemodynamic stability. The liposomal formulation, in turn, maintains effective analgesia for over 48 h [ 23 , 24 ]. This strategy effectively addresses the dose-confounding issues commonly seen in previous comparative studies [ 15 , 25 , 26 ] and provides a new framework for evaluating extended-release formulations in clinical settings. In this way, the primary outcomes were not influenced by the increased dose of conventional bupivacaine, while ensuring a reasonable comparison of equivalent doses.\n\nPostoperative recovery assessed via QoR-15 revealed superior scores in the liposomal bupivacaine group on both postoperative days. Although the POD-1 difference (5.5 points) narrowly missed the 6.0-point [ 27 ] threshold for clinical significance, the POD-2 improvement (8.1 points) surpassed this benchmark, highlighting liposomal bupivacaine's capacity to attenuate delayed pain exacerbation. This temporal pattern correlates with reduced opioid-related complications—notably respiratory depression and gastrointestinal dysfunction—facilitating earlier mobilization [ 28 ]. Furthermore, despite IL-6 levels in the plain bupivacaine with dexamethasone group (attributable to dexamethasone's anti-inflammatory action [ 29 ]), recovery metrics favored the liposomal group, suggesting analgesia quality outweighs isolated inflammatory modulation in postoperative rehabilitation.\n\nThe sustained analgesic advantage observed in the liposomal group during the 48-h period can be directly attributed to its porous membrane-controlled release mechanism. The microencapsulation technique allows for a controlled, sustained release of the drug, overcoming the binary (\"all-or-none\") effect typical of conventional local anesthetics and providing continuous, dynamic analgesic coverage. Notably, intermittent fluctuations in the anesthetic block plane were observed in some patients within the liposomal bupivacaine group, as demonstrated by pinprick testing. This suggests the formation of a \"drug depot\" within the fascial layers [ 8 , 30 ]. Although the heterogeneous release pattern occasionally resulted in subtherapeutic troughs (manifested as intermittent blocks), therapeutic threshold concentrations were overall maintained. Zadrazil et al. [ 22 ] and Ilfeld et al. [ 31 ] found that low-dose bupivacaine liposomes can induce prolonged sensory block, but often result in inconsistent sensory and motor block, as well as fluctuating effects over time. Therefore, the diffusion properties and dosage optimization of liposomal bupivacaine in fascial plane blocks warrant further investigation.\n\nThe study had some limitations. First, its single-center design and modest sample size may limit generalizability. Second, sensory blockade assessment focused on the medial scapular region, omitting midclavicular evaluation, which might underdetect incomplete dermatomal coverage. Third, short-term follow-up precluded analysis of chronic pain outcomes.\n\nConclusions\n\nIn conclusion, under a dose-equivalence design, rhomboid intercostal block with liposomal bupivacaine provided non-inferior effective analgesia to plain bupivacaine with dexamethasone. Plain bupivacaine with dexamethasone can be used interchangeably with liposomal bupivacaine for postoperative analgesia following VATS.\n\nSupplementary Information\n\nBelow is the link to the electronic supplementary material.
