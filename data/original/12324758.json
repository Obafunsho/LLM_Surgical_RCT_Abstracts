  "title": "The Role of Acetaminophen Use in Acute Kidney Injury Prevention in Cardiac Surgery: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis",
  "abstract": "Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common complication following cardiac surgery, often leading to increased morbidity and mortality. Despite its prevalence, the role of acetaminophen in preventing AKI after cardiac surgery remains uncertain. This meta-analysis sought to clarify whether perioperative administration of acetaminophen could reduce the risk of postoperative AKI in adult patients undergoing cardiac procedures. To address this question, a systematic review and meta-analysis were performed by searching the MEDLINE, Cochrane, and Embase databases. Studies comparing the effects of perioperative acetaminophen to those of no acetaminophen in adult cardiac surgery patients were evaluated, with risk of bias assessed for each study. Sensitivity analyses were also conducted to strengthen the reliability of the findings. In total, 13 studies, including nine randomized controlled trials and four observational studies, involving 11,583 patients, were analyzed. The results showed that acetaminophen administration was associated with a lower incidence of AKI [OR 0.62 (95% CI 0.40–0.97), P = 0.04]. Additionally, acetaminophen use was linked to reduced in-hospital mortality, delirium rates, and shorter ICU stays, though it had no significant effect on overall hospital length of stay. These findings suggest that perioperative acetaminophen administration may play a protective role in reducing both AKI incidence and in-hospital mortality in patients undergoing cardiac surgery. Until large multicenter randomized controlled trials confirm these results, acetaminophen may still be considered as a preventive measure for patients both before cardiopulmonary bypass initiation and in the postoperative period.",

Elevations in serum creatinine following cardiac surgery are linked to the progression of chronic disease states and poor outcomes, including heart failure, major adverse cardiovascular events, and long-term postoperative mortality.[ 1 ]\n\nThe complex pathophysiology of AKI following cardiac surgery involves multiple contributing factors. These factors include preoperative atheroembolism, intraoperative hemodynamic instability, hypoperfusion, and oxidative stress. Additionally, ischemia-reperfusion injury, inflammation, and hemolysis (with the release of cell-free hemoglobin during surgery) play important roles.[ 4 ] Despite extensive research exploring various pharmacological agents, no promising solutions for AKI prevention have been identified. However, emerging evidence suggests that acetaminophen, a commonly used analgesic, available worldwide, and of low cost, might play a role as a potential renoprotective agent.[ 5 ] Previous studies have demonstrated associations between acetaminophen administration and reduced odds of AKI in both pediatric and adult cardiac surgery patients.[ 6 7 ] Given the high incidence of AKI in cardiac surgery patients and its association with postoperative adverse outcomes, there is an ongoing clinical need to explore agents that might be effective at its prevention or treatment.\n\nTo investigate this issue further, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies examining the role of acetaminophen in cardiac surgery. We hypothesized that perioperative acetaminophen administration is associated with reduced odds of developing AKI.\n\nMETHODS\n\nThis systematic review and meta-analysis was registered in the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO) under protocol CRD42024514111. This study was designed in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) reporting guidelines. Due to the public status of the data and its nonidentifiable characteristics, no IRB registration was made.\n\nSearch strategy and data extraction\n\nMEDLINE, Cochrane, and Embase databases were systematically searched in February 2024. The search strategy was as follows: (“cardiac surgery” OR “CABG” OR “valvular” OR “valve” OR “by-pass” OR “bypass” OR “heart surgery” OR “cardiac anesthesia” OR “OPCABG” OR “CPB” OR “cardiopulmonary bypass”) AND (acetaminophen OR Tylenol OR paracetamol OR APAP). All identified articles were systematically assessed using inclusion and exclusion criteria. Article selection and data extraction were undertaken independently by two reviewers (LC, TB). Disagreements were resolved by consensus or by a third reviewer (MC).\n\nEligibility criteria\n\nWe included studies that met the following eligibility criteria: peer-reviewed (1) randomized trials or nonrandomized case-control or cohort; (2) comparing the administration of preoperative, intraoperative, or postoperative oral and/or intravenous acetaminophen with no administration in patients undergoing various types of cardiac surgery (elective or emergent, congenital, valvular, coronary, or thoracic aortic). We excluded studies with (1) overlapping populations, (2) pediatric patients (younger than 18 years of age), (3) no control group, and (4) those written in a non-English language. There were no restrictions concerning the date of publication.\n\nInterventions and outcomes\n\nThe primary outcome was the (1) incidence of postoperative AKI, as defined by each study (see Table 1 ). Secondary endpoints included (2) in-hospital mortality (defined as intraoperative or postoperative deaths), (3) postoperative delirium, as defined by each study, (4) intensive care unit (ICU) length of stay (LOS), and (5) hospital LOS. Two authors tabulated the results of each study using an Excel spreadsheet. The administration and dosage regimen of acetaminophen differed across studies, as seen in Table 1 .\n\nRisk of bias assessment\n\nThe Cochrane tool for assessing risk of bias in randomized trials (RoB 2) was utilized for quality assessment of randomized studies.[ 8 ] Nonrandomized studies were appraised with the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS).[ 9 ] The risk of bias evaluation was performed independently by two authors (LC, VP), with disagreements resolved by a third author (MC). Publication bias was assessed with funnel-plot analysis and Egger’s test of the all-cause mortality endpoint to evaluate the symmetric distribution of trials with similar weights.[ 10 ]\n\nStatistical analysis\n\nStudies that reported median and interquartile intervals had mean and standard deviations calculated based on a validated method (Wan et al .).[ 11 ] ICU LOS was calculated in hours. Therefore, studies that reported their values in days were converted to hours (rounding 1 day to 24 hours). Treatment effects for binary endpoints were compared using odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs), whereas continuous endpoints were compared using mean difference (MD) with 95% CI. The restricted maximum-likelihood random effects model was used for the outcomes of interest. Heterogeneity was examined with Cochran’s Q test, I2 statistics, and Tau-square. Heterogeneity was reported as low (I2 = 0–25%), moderate (I2 = 26–50%), or high (I2 > 50%). All statistical analyses were performed using R Studio Version 2023.12.1 + 402.\n\nGiven the high heterogeneity, a sensitivity analysis was conducted to assess the robustness of the primary outcome (AKI). A studentized residual test was applied to identify potential outliers in participant numbers. Studies with outlying participant counts were excluded, and the outcomes were recalculated, resulting in a final analysis with low heterogeneity.\n\nRole of funding\n\nThere was no funding source for this study. All authors had full access to the data. The corresponding author had final responsibility for the decision to submit it for publication.\n\nRESULTS\n\nStudy selection and baseline characteristics\n\nA total of 3039 studies were screened through MEDLINE, Cochrane, and Embase databases [ Figure 1 ]. Of these, 2941 were excluded based on title and abstract; 98 were read in full. Of these, 13 studies were included for review, comprising nine randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and four observational studies [ Table 1 ]. The total number of patients was 11,583, with 7833 (67.62%) in the acetaminophen group and 3750 (32.38%) in the control group.[ 4 7 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 ] The unequal sample sizes between the groups highlight the impact of observational studies, lacking randomization. Xiong et al . analyzed two different datasets with two different populations.[ 4 ] Therefore, each had their individual results plotted. Subramaniam et al .[ 15 ] had four groups (dexmedetomidine and acetaminophen, dexmedetomidine and placebo, propofol and acetaminophen, propofol and placebo) and reported ICU and hospital LOS for each group; therefore, each group had their results plotted separately.\n\nPrimary and secondary endpoints\n\nAKI, the primary outcome, was reported in four studies involving a total of 7403 patients in the acetaminophen group and 3190 patients in the control group. The definition used to diagnose AKI differed among the studies [see Table 1 ]. One study defined AKI using AKIN classification[ 12 ]; another used a serum creatinine threshold of more than 2 mg/dL[ 14 ]; two studies employed KDIGO criteria.[ 4 7 ] Postoperative administration of acetaminophen was associated with reduced odds of AKI [OR 0.62 (95% CI 0.40–0.97), P = 0.04] [ Figure 2 ]. When stratifying for retrospective studies only (3 different populations, with a total of 7323 patients in the treatment group and 3110 in the control group), no statistically significant difference was obtained [OR = 0.57 (95% CI 0.32–1.01), P = 0.05]. Due to the small number of RCTs, it was not possible to perform an analysis including RCTs only.\n\nIn-hospital mortality was reported in three studies, with a total of 7380 patients in the acetaminophen group and 3175 in the control group.[ 4 7 13 ] Ninety-eight patients (1.33%) died in the acetaminophen group versus 87 (2.74%) in the control group. Acetaminophen administration was associated with lower in-hospital mortality [OR 0.52 (95% CI 0.29–0.92), P = 0.02] [ Figure 3 ].\n\nThree studies reported rates of postoperative delirium, with a total of 254 patients included (123 in the acetaminophen group and 131 in the control group).[ 13 15 16 ] Subramaniam et al . and Susheela et al . defined delirium using the Confusion Assessment Method,[ 15 16 ] while Almoghrabi et al . defined it as postoperative confusion.[ 13 ] The incidence of delirium was lower in the intervention group [OR 0.22 (95% CI 0.09–0.54), P < 0.001] [ Figure 4 ].\n\nICU LOS was reported in eight studies, including 858 patients.[ 13 15 17 18 19 20 21 22 ] The acetaminophen group had a shorter ICU LOS [MD -6.64 hours (95% CI -10.60, -2.68), P = 0.001] [ Figure 5 ].\n\nFinally, seven studies reported hospital LOS, with a total of 352 patients in the acetaminophen group and 360 in the control group.[ 12 13 15 16 17 19 22 ] There was no difference in this outcome between the groups [MD -0.19 days (95% CI -0.71, 0.33), P = 0.47].\n\nSensitivity analysis\n\nInitially, the primary outcome (AKI) exhibited apparent heterogeneity as indicated by the Q-test (Q (5) = 50.8697, P < 0.0001, tau² = 0.1842, I² = 87.1615%). Notably, the larger populations reported in Xiong (1) (2023) and Xiong (2) (2023) were identified as potential outliers by the studentized residual test. Consequently, to evaluate their influence on the initial findings, a recalculation of AKI rates excluding these two populations (9631 patients) was performed. Upon removal of Xiong et al .[ 4 ] from the statistical analysis, the result was nonheterogeneous. Importantly, the difference in AKI rates remained statistically significant, favoring the acetaminophen group [OR 0.72 (95% CI 0.55–0.94), P = 0.02].\n\nQuality assessment\n\nThe risk of bias of nine RCTs is shown in Figure 6 . Six studies had a low overall bias. Three RCTs presented some concerns. Despite blinding for acetaminophen, Subramaniam et al .[ 15 ] and Susheela et al .[ 16 ] did not blind for propofol use. Therefore, they performed as “some concerns” on domain 4 (bias in the measurement of the outcome). In the study by Jelacic et al. ,[ 18 ] the baseline BMI was significantly lower in the acetaminophen group, posing concerns regarding the randomization process.\n\nFigure 7 shows the risk of bias in four observational studies. Three cohort studies matched intervention and control patients. All four nonrandomized publications achieved seven or more points on the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale, classifying three as good quality[ 4 7 13 ] and one as poor quality.[ 19 ]\n\nThe risk of publication bias for AKI was assessed by funnel plot and regression test for funnel plot asymmetry. Despite displaying a little visual asymmetry, the regression test for funnel plot asymmetry (Egger’s test) was not statistically significant ( P = 0.24). Therefore, there is no evidence that small-study effects are present in this meta-analysis.\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nTo our knowledge, this is the first systematic review and meta-analysis evaluating postoperative acetaminophen for AKI prevention in adults undergoing cardiac surgery. AKI is a prevalent complication in cardiac surgery patients, particularly in those with advanced age and multiple comorbidities.[ 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 ] The escalating risk profile of cardiac surgery patients in recent years underscores the urgent need for effective preventative or therapeutic measures. Our meta-analysis suggests that acetaminophen, a readily available and cost-effective intervention, may mitigate the risk of AKI associated with cardiac surgery in addition to reduce in-hospital mortality, delirium, and ICU length of stay.\n\nThe pathophysiology of cardiac surgery-associated AKI is complex, multifactorial, and not fully elucidated. Hemolysis and red blood cell damage appear to play an important role. Contributors include shear stress on erythrocytes as blood flows through the cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) circuit, the use of venting and suction devices, and cell salvage techniques, potentially being exacerbated by allogeneic red blood cell transfusion.[ 29 30 31 ] The damaged red blood cells release nephrotoxic components, such as cell-free hemoglobin and other heme-derived products that may cause kidney injury through mechanisms that involve oxidative stress, inflammation, and reduced nitric oxide availability.[ 32 33 34 35 ] Furthermore, studies suggest that cell-free hemoglobin exacerbates kidney injury through the oxidation of heme moiety’s central iron to form the highly reactive and nephrotoxic ferryl (Fe4þ) form.[ 35 ]\n\nThe proposed mechanism by which acetaminophen exerts renal protection primarily stems from animal studies involving induced rhabdomyolysis. Acetaminophen was found to intercept ferryl myoglobin and inhibit rhabdomyolysis-induced lipid peroxidation catalyzed by hemoprotein.[ 36 ] In the same study, acetaminophen showed promise in protecting kidney function from rhabdomyolysis-induced injury, as evidenced by decreased markers of lipid peroxidation.[ 36 ] This hypothesis was corroborated by small trials in pediatric and adult cardiac surgical patients, demonstrating attenuation in plasma isofurans when acetaminophen was administered every 6 hours for 24 hours preceding cardiopulmonary bypass initiation.[ 12 37 ] Whether there is a dose-dependent relationship between acetaminophen and AKI, it has not been explored in adult patients.\n\nSeveral retrospective cohort studies have reported lower rates of AKI with acetaminophen administration in postoperative cardiac surgery patients.[ 19 37 ] The largest study, by Xiong et al. ,[ 4 ] encompassed 9631 patients, drawing from the MIMIC-III and eICU databases. In their multivariable logistic regression model, acetaminophen exposure was associated with a significant reduction in the risk of severe AKI (defined as KDIGO stage 2 or 3) as well as any stage AKI. However, despite observational evidence, there is a lack of large-scale randomized controlled trials investigating acetaminophen’s renoprotective effects post cardiac surgery.\n\nOur subgroup analysis including only observational studies failed to reveal a difference in AKI rates between the groups, despite three out of the four studies favoring the acetaminophen group.[ 4 7 ] The one study with different results had lower AKI rates in the control group.[ 13 ] In this study, the authors reported only one case of AKI in the acetaminophen group out of a total of 121 participants, an incidence well below average in the cardiac surgery population. Therefore, this result should be interpreted with caution. Our meta-analysis offers promising insights, suggesting that perioperative acetaminophen administration may diminish AKI occurrence and mortality in cardiac surgery patients.\n\nGiven the limited number of RCTs, it would be beneficial to perform an RCT examining the role of acetaminophen in AKI. Assuming an AKI incidence of 30% in the unexposed group[ 1 38 ] and 20% in the acetaminophen group after cardiac surgery, with a 95% CI and 80% power, we would need a sample size of 307 patients in each group. However, if we anticipate a 25% incidence in the acetaminophen group, the sample size increases to 1161 patients in each group. Therefore, it is essential to conduct a large multicenter study.[ 39 ]\n\nNotably, akin to previous research, we observed an association between acetaminophen use and reduced delirium rates, a prevalent neurocognitive complication postcardiac surgery.[ 36 ] Delirium has been associated not only with postoperative cognitive dysfunction but also with increased risk of discharge to nursing facilities, mortality, and cost.[ 36 ] Consequently, the impact of acetaminophen in positively affecting the recovery trajectory of individuals undergoing cardiac surgery could be very significant. An important step in analyzing delirium is to account for the heterogeneity of its definitions. While two studies used the Confusion Assessment Method (CAM),[ 15 16 ] one study did not report the method used to screen for delirium.[ 13 ] Additionally, studies by Subramaniam et al . and Susheela et al . investigated the impact of adjuvants on postoperative delirium.[ 15 16 ] These studies included four groups: acetaminophen with propofol, acetaminophen with dexmedetomidine, placebo with propofol, and placebo with dexmedetomidine. Both studies resulted in delirium reduction in the acetaminophen group. Subramaniam et al .[ 15 ] further reported that acetaminophen use was associated with reduced delirium duration and decreased postoperative opioid requirements compared to the placebo group. The ongoing multicenter PANDORA trial ( NCT04093219 ) will help shed light on this important clinical question.[ 40 ]\n\nMoreover, our meta-analysis revealed a significant reduction in ICU LOS in the intervention group. Given the resource-intensive nature of ICU care and the associated clinical and financial implications, minimizing ICU LOS holds paramount importance[ 41 ] and is in the best interest of patients and healthcare systems. The mechanism through which acetaminophen might affect ICU LOS is unclear. It is possible that its association with reduced rates of AKI and delirium could result in less time spent in the ICU. Furthermore, its analgesic and antipyretic effects might also play a role in the decision to discharge patients from intensive care. Despite the reduction in ICU LOS, a difference in hospital LOS was not observed between the groups.\n\nOur study has several limitations. The inclusion of observational studies alongside RCTs may affect the robustness of our findings and introduce selection bias. Due to the small number of RCTs reporting AKI as an outcome, subgroup analysis of these RCTs was not possible. Sensitivity analysis revealed significant heterogeneity in the primary outcome, necessitating meticulous scrutiny and exclusion of potential outliers. In eight of the 13 studies included, AKI was not a primary outcome. This raises concerns about the accuracy of data collection as the focus on AKI may have been insufficient, potentially compromising the reliability of the reported findings. Furthermore, inconsistencies in AKI definition and acetaminophen dosing characterization pose challenges in interpreting our results accurately. The optimal timing and dosing regimen for acetaminophen administration remain elusive, warranting further investigation. Notably, our results indicate only an association with the outcome, without establishing causality. Furthermore, given the large sample size (N = 11,583) and the borderline statistical significance ( P = 0.04), the treatment effect is likely modest.\n\nAdditionally, Xiong’s study disproportionately influences AKI and mortality outcomes due to its retrospective design and large sample size. Despite the weight adjustments made on the forest plot, the considerable influence of Xiong’s study raises concerns about the robustness of the findings. The absence of a standardized protocol for acetaminophen administration across studies, combined with the possibility that patients unable to take acetaminophen may have received alternative NSAIDs, could have introduced bias into our results. Last, some institutions do not give IV Tylenol to critically ill patients, which could impact the result of two of our outcomes (mortality and ICU LOS).\n\nThis systematic review and meta-analysis provide evidence that perioperative acetaminophen administration may reduce the incidence of postoperative AKI in patients undergoing cardiac surgery. Additionally, the intervention was also associated with lower in-hospital mortality, delirium rates, and duration of ICU stay. Our study underscores acetaminophen’s potential as an effective perioperative intervention for improving cardiac surgery outcomes. Further research is essential to comprehensively understand acetaminophen’s potential role as a kidney-protective medication. While awaiting the results of RCTs, our meta-analysis suggests that acetaminophen can be considered for use before initiation of cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) and postoperatively for patients undergoing cardiac surgery.\n\nConflicts of interest\n\nThere are no conflicts of interest.",
