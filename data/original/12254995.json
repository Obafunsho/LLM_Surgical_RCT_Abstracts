  "abstract": "Objectives: There is controversy over the optimal management of moderate tricuspid valve regurgitation during left-sided valve surgery due to the paucity of robust evidence for enhanced outcomes from concomitant tricuspid valve repair.

We identified articles to evaluate primary outcomes of both, cardiac and overall mortality. Secondary outcomes included stroke, wound infection, reoperation, new-onset atrial fibrillation, renal failure, duration of intensive care stay and permanent pacemaker implantation. All analysis was done using the random effects model.\n\nResults: A total of 36 studies were included with 76,249 patients. There was significant reduction in cardiac mortality ( p < 0.0001) with concomitant tricuspid valve repair despite higher CPB ( p < 0.00001) and X-Clamp times ( p < 0.00001). There was no significant difference in overall mortality. There was significantly lower postoperative tricuspid regurgitation ( p < 0.00001) with concomitant tricuspid repair. There were no differences in postoperative stroke, wound infection, atrial fibrillation, renal failure, and intensive care unit duration of stay between the two groups.\n\nConclusions: Concomitant tricuspid valve surgery for moderate tricuspid regurgitation during left-sided valve surgery offers improved survival benefit due to significant decrease in cardiac mortality.

It is well documented that correction of MV/AV disease mitigates pulmonary artery hypertension (PAH). A common presumption is that resultant improvement in right ventricular (RV) hemodynamics might diminish moderate TR. Furthermore, intraoperative reduction in systemic vascular resistance under anaesthesia impedes precise on-table evaluation of TR. Paucity of definitive evidence has dampened the enthusiasm to pursue concomitant correction of moderate TR; a strategy which may increase the technical complexity and consequently cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) time in patients already undergoing MV/AV surgery. However, Concomitant Tricuspid Repair (CTR) is definitive and improves RV function. More importantly, this approach obviates the need for late reoperation due to severe TR in patients with RV failure. Reoperation under these circumstances carries a substantial surgical risk and portends a poor clinical outcome.\n\nThere are contrarian viewpoints in managing varying degrees of functional TR at the time of MV/AV surgery. Variability in repair rates range 7–65% around the world [ 1 ]. While the previous meta-analyses done by Cardoso et al. and Yasmin et al. looked at overall mortality and showed no statistically significant difference [ 2 , 3 ], the study by Kara et al. commented only on the progression of severity of TR in cases of moderate or less-than moderate TR [ 4 ] and that by Pagnesi et al [ 5 ] showed a significant reduction in the cardiac-cause mortality but failed to analyse the other commonly seen early postoperative morbidities. Since then there have been multiple studies published looking at CTR with MV/AV surgery. This meta-analysis aims to determine the best available evidence for CTR in functional moderate TR when patients undergo MV/AV surgery, with respect to intraoperative and early postoperative outcomes.\n\nMethods\n\nA systematic literature search was performed using PubMed, EMBASE and Google Scholar until January 2024 using MESH search headings: (Mitral Valve Surgery [Title]) AND (Tricuspid Valve Surgery [Title]) OR Concomitant [Title] (Mitral valve/Aortic valve Heart Surgery [Title]) AND (Tricuspid Valve Annuloplasty[Title])\n\nAll studies comparing outcomes for MV/AV surgery with or without CTR for Functional TR were included in the study. Moderate TR was defined according to Echocardiographic parameters in these studies by the authors. The resulting titles and abstracts were screened for relevance, followed by evaluation of the remaining publications in their entirety.\n\nExclusion criteria: Not available in English. Involved animal studies. Pertained to literature reviews or single case reports. Non-surgical treatment of Mitral/Aortic and Tricuspid valves. TR due to any cause other than functional.\n\nThe criterion was widened further by using the ‘related article’ function during the search. Additionally, a manual search was performed for publications in keeping with the above criteria. CINAHL, DARE, ACP, LILACS, and SCOPUS databases were also used to conduct the search from 1966 to 2024. This search was supplemented by a hand search of published abstracts from 1980 to 2024 in meetings of the Surgical Societies worldwide. Current Controlled Trials Register, The Cochrane Database of Controlled Trials and Science Citation Index Expanded were searched. The reference lists of all articles obtained were further examined to identify additional relevant studies. Review articles were also obtained to determine other possible studies. We applied the PRISMA guidelines.\n\nEligibility for study inclusion into the meta-analysis and study quality assessment were performed independently by four of the authors (SJ, MU, AB & NW). Study data was extracted onto standard forms. Any disagreements were resolved by the senior author (LB). Studies were only included if they were trials in which direct comparisons were made between patients who had CTR and No Concomitant Tricuspid Valve Repair (non-CTR) with MV/AV surgery. Any unclear or missing information was obtained by contacting the authors of the individual trials. For duplicate publications, the smaller dataset was excluded.\n\nThe quality of each study was assessed by use of Newcastle–Ottawa scale, which is a nine-point scale that assigns points based on the process of selection (0–4 points), comparability (0–2 points), and identification of the outcomes of study participants (0–3 points).\n\nThe primary outcomes were mortality (all-cause and cardiac-cause) and postoperative stroke rates. Secondary outcomes were CPB time, Aortic cross-clamp (X-clamp) time, length of Intensive care unit (ITU) stay, postoperative TR grade, sternal wound infection, early reoperation for bleeding/tamponade and late reoperation for TR grade progression, atrial fibrillation, renal failure and need for permanent pacemaker (PPM). Only trials that reported at least one of the primary or secondary outcome measures were included in the meta-analysis.\n\nStatistical analysis\n\nData from the individual eligible studies were entered into a spreadsheet for further analysis. RevMan 5.4.1 was used to perform the statistical analysis. Weighted mean differences (WMD) were calculated for the effect size of continuous variables such as CPB times/X-clamp times. Pooled odds-ratios (OR) were calculated for discrete variables such as stroke and mortality rates.\n\nFor this analysis, the random effects model with a 95% confidence interval (CI) was used when there was a substantial risk of heterogeneity, originating from the non-randomised nature of the included studies. In addition, because risk profiles and selection criteria differed between centres, the random effects model was favoured. The I 2 test for heterogeneity was conducted to assess variability across studies that could not be due to random error alone. High I 2 values indicated that the observed variability among studies could not be explained by chance (i.e., a consequence of clinical and/or methodological diversity). Heterogeneity was deemed to be substantial and considerable if I 2 > 50% and I 2 > 75%, respectively with p value < 0.10. No additional analyses were conducted.\n\nResults\n\nThe search criteria as stated in the methods section were performed. Search strategies #1 and #2 described above yielded 773 and 441 results respectively. Figure 1 illustrates the selection process of articles for inclusion in the study. After screening and evaluating the studies a total of 36 studies were included in the meta-analysis. Publication years ranged from 2005 to 2024. Table 1 shows the characteristics of the included trials. From these 36 studies, there were a total of 76,249 patients. Of these 14,765 patients had CTR compared to 61,484 patients had non-CTR. The mean ages of the CTR and the non-CTR groups were 61.9 vs 61. years with the same study not providing any data about the mean age of patients in each group. The CTR group had a male: female sex ratio of 4:5 compared to 6.5:5 in the non-CTR group. Table 2 shows the demographic characteristics and echocardiographic data of the included trials. Additional patient pre-operative characteristics are shown in Table 3 . Statistical results of the outcome measures of the included studies are shown in Table 4 .\n\nThe analysis in Fig. 2 shows that all-cause mortality is not statistically significant between the two groups, however, there was statistically significant heterogeneity between the studies (I 2 = 95%; p < 0.00001). Cardiac-cause mortality is significantly lower (p < 0.0001) in the CTR group than in the non-CTR group with no significant heterogeneity (I 2 = 0%; p = 0.68) (Fig. 2 ). The postoperative TR severity grades are significantly lower in the CTR group ( p < 0.00001). Secondary outcome parameters detailed in Fig. 3 : reoperation, atrial fibrillation, wound infection, renal failure, stroke, PPM implantation rates and length of ITU stay showed no statistically significant differences. CPB times and X-clamp times were significantly higher in the CTR group ( p < 0.00001) (Fig. 3 ).\n\nComment\n\nLeft ventricular dysfunction due to MV/AV pathology leads to PAH and eventually RV dysfunction. Consequently, disease progression contributes to the development of functional TR, most likely attributed to morphological changes in the RV and tricuspid valve (TV) annulus [ 6 ]. Functional TR is reported in up to a third of patients with MV/AV heart disease. In this group, prevalence of preoperative TR as determined by echocardiography ranges as follows: 8% severe TR, 32% moderate TR and 62% mild TR [ 15 ].\n\nThere is Class I evidence to support CTR to treat severe TR [ 37 ]. The management of functional moderate TR is contentious and in practical terms, corrective surgical therapy has been largely subjective. Hence, the management of moderate functional TR is quite varied with reported CTR rates between 7 to 65% in the literature [ 1 ]. This study addresses the rationale for considering CTR by pooled meta-analysis of outcomes from the literature.\n\nThis meta-analysis reinforces that CTR was not associated with increased morbidity, which is similar to a previous propensity-matched analysis [ 10 ]. More importantly, this study demonstrates that there is a significant decrease in cardiac mortality ( p < 0.0001) in the CTR group (5.69%) compared to the non-CTR group (12.3%) which contradicts the findings by Gammie et al. who showed that the mortality rates and rates of major cardiac events was the same for both groups [ 36 ]. Moreover, CTR group had an overall mortality rate of 2.13% which was not statistically different ( p = 0.45) compared to a mortality rate of 2.48% in the non-CTR group. Therefore, performing an additional procedure does not increase overall mortality. CTR appears to have a protective effect on cardiac outcomes in patients with moderate functional TR despite increasing operative complexity as reflected in the longer CPB and X-clamp times. This meta-analysis reassures that the latter does not confer any additional mortality and morbidity in the CTR group and highlights the value of performing CTR for moderate functional TR.\n\nFurthermore, subgroup analysis reveals that the CTR group did not have an increase in postoperative stroke, wound infection, and reoperation rates. Only three studies compared length of ITU stay between these two groups [ 18 , 26 , 34 ]. There was no difference in ITU length of stay between the two groups.\n\nWe observed, from secondary outcome analysis, that untreated moderate TR in the non-CTR group led to deterioration in RV function resulting in higher TR postoperatively leading to higher postoperative mortality and this is consistent with other authors [ 8 , 16 , 38 – 42 ]. The adverse effects of progression of RV remodelling in the non-CTR group are reflected in the poor performance status and decreased 6 min walk test [ 34 ]. Chan et al. showed that CTR improves TR grades and consequently improves NYHA status [ 9 ]. Gammie et al. did not show any differences in the quality of life and NYHA status between the two treatment groups at 2 years [ 36 ]. Unfortunately, data was inadequate to determine the effect of CTR on symptom status or quality of life in our study.\n\nDreyfus et al. proposed that intraoperative annular dilatation (> 70 mm diameter) is an indication for tricuspid repair in equal measure to TR grading. Intraoperatively, TR is a less reliable parameter because it depends on many factors, including preload, afterload and RV function. Tricuspid repair based on annular dimensions has been shown to improve functional status with a trend towards better survival when compared with a group of patients with untreated tricuspid annular dilatation, irrespective of TR severity [ 6 ]. A retrospective study by Van De Veire et al. compared 2 patient cohorts treated during different historical periods, finding a higher rate of TR in patients with dilated annulus (≥ 40 mm) [ 43 ].\n\nThere is echocardiographic evidence that CTR with MV/AV surgery alleviates PAH and has a favourable effect on RV remodelling without increasing mortality or morbidity [ 24 , 44 ]. CTR offers significant reduction in Tricuspid Annular Plane Systolic Excursion (TAPSE), peak systolic velocity, and RV free wall stress. Isolated mitral surgery promotes early postoperative RV reverse remodelling; however, this is not sustained if moderate TR is left untreated, resulting in progressive deterioration in the severity of TR [ 24 ]. Untreated TR causes RV failure and long-term morbidity that may necessitate perilous reoperative surgery with associated mortality rates of 10–35% [ 21 , 39 , 45 – 47 ]. Independent risk factors for progression of TR postoperatively include female sex, preoperative atrial fibrillation, diabetes, right atrial dimensions, and elevated RV pressures [ 48 , 49 ]. A strategy of CTR during MV/AV surgery will prevent TR progression over time. Chikwe et al [ 50 ] compared 226 patients undergoing MV repair with 419 patients undergoing concurrent MV and TV repair. A strategy of routine CTR in cases with at least moderate TR or significant annular dilatation (≥ 40 mm diameter), irrespective of TR grade, was associated with virtual elimination of residual and recurrent TR at long-term follow-up after 7 years. In addition, CTR was independently associated with late RV improvement in patients, even in those with echocardiographic evidence of RV dysfunction at hospital discharge. Our meta-analysis confirms that CTR at the time of MV/AV surgery facilitates significant improvement in severity of TR grade which was evident on echocardiographic follow-up studies.\n\nThis Meta-analysis shows no difference in the incidence of PPM Implantation ( p = 0.12) between the two groups which is in variance with some studies [ 14 , 21 , 29 , 36 ]. Several confounding factors potentially influence PPM implantation rates including surgery for atrial fibrillation and presence of sinus node disorders. Interestingly, a study of TV operations found that postoperative PPM implantation was associated with improved life expectancy albeit with greater morbidity [ 51 ].\n\nThe durability of TV repair is influenced by preoperative factors which may be affected by the degree of TV tethering and quality of TV annulus [ 39 , 52 , 53 ]. It is also dependent on postoperative RV hemodynamics and pulmonary artery pressures. Patients with such risk factors may require close surveillance even after early successful TV repair.\n\nThere are several caveats to the interpretation of the results of this meta-analysis, primarily arising out of the observational design and retrospective data collection in the included studies. The decision to treat patients using either modality was at the discretion of treating physicians; hence selection bias was inevitable. This may have resulted in systematic differences in variables, which could have influenced outcomes with either treatment modality. However, this pooled analysis of 76,249 patients is the largest meta-analysis to date to our knowledge. A randomised controlled trial would be the gold-standard tool to establish the value of CTR for functional moderate TR or less than moderate TR with dilated TV annulus and to look at the need for long-term reoperation rates for progression of moderate TR to severe TR.\n\nNovel transcatheter alternative therapies are currently being developed and studied in inoperable patients or patients with prior cardiac surgery and presenting with recurrent or residual TR [ 8 , 54 – 62 ]. Recently, concomitant mitral valve and tricuspid valve repair in robotic-assisted surgery and in high risk-population showed better mortality, and morbidity results but no improvement in quality of life [ 63 – 67 ]. However, late TR is associated with gross TV annular dilatation and this would be considered as unsuitable anatomy for transcatheter therapies. TV repair surgical techniques are not feasible in such cases and this necessitates high-risk TV replacement, which has a guarded prognosis. Hence, we advocate CTR as a primary protective strategy to prognostically improve clinical and echocardiographic outcomes in patients undergoing MV/AV surgery.\n\nConclusion\n\nThis meta-analysis confirms that CTR for moderate functional TR decreases cardiac mortality in patients when undergoing MV/AV surgery. Furthermore, this proactive strategy decreases late TR with improved RV function.",
