  "title": "Impact of distension pressure on saphenous vein endothelial injury in coronary artery bypass grafting",
  "abstract": "Introduction: Long saphenous vein grafts (LSVGs) are pivotal conduits in coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), yet concerns persist regarding early failure and long-term patency. Endothelial damage, a potent initiator of graft failure, necessitates exploration of factors contributing to endothelial injury during LSVG preparation.\n\nMethods: A prospective, single-center study was conducted, assessing the impact of unregulated distension pressure on LSVG endothelium during CABG. Histological and CD31 (cluster of differentiation 31) immunohistochemical analyses were performed on 21 paired vein samples, categorized into non-distended (group A) and distended (group B) groups. Pressure recordings were obtained using different syringe sizes during vein distension.\n\nResults: Histological examination revealed a significantly higher percentage of endothelial cell loss in distended veins (31.95% ± 31.31) compared to non-distended veins (11.67% ± 28.65) ( p = 0.034). CD31 immunohistochemistry corroborated greater endothelial cell loss in distended veins ( p = 0.001). The pressure recordings with a 20-cc syringe, as opposed to using a 10-cc syringe, were considerably lower (44.5 mmHg vs. 92.75 mmHg) emphasizing the inverse relationship between syringe size and pressure generated. In our study, pre-existing endothelial injury was observed in one-third of diabetic patients (36%), with all instances of such injury exclusively identified in individuals with diabetes.\n\nConclusion: Unregulated distension pressure during LSVG preparation is associated with greater endothelial damage, as evidenced by histological and immunohistochemical analyses. The inverse relationship between syringe size and pressure underscores the importance of controlled distension.",
