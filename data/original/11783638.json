  "full_text": "Introduction\n\nPropofol is one of the most commonly used anaesthetics worldwide, especially for induction and total intravenous anaesthesia (TIVA). 1 – 4 Propofol exerts its hypnotic effect at the so-called biophase or effect site, which is roughly equivalent to the brain. However, because of the pharmacokinetics of propofol, a constant infusion neither results in a stable plasma concentration nor in a steady effect site concentration. Consequently, anaesthetic depth changes, despite a constant infusion rate. Therefore, target-controlled infusion (TCI) pumps have been developed. With a TCI pump, a target concentration to be reached in the plasma ( C pl ) or effect site ( C e ) is programmed into the pump: with a standard infusion pump a simple rate of delivery is programmed. 5 , 6 Based on a pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) model, the TCI pump calculates (and delivers) the required amount of propofol to achieve the target concentration. A frequently used PK/PD model is the one described by Schnider, 7 which consists of a three-compartment model. Mathematically, this model is determined by the three compartment volumes ( V 1 , V 2 , V 3 ) and three clearance rates (Cl 1 , Cl 2 , Cl 3 ) for these compartments. These parameters are converted into micro rate constants k ij , which define the rate of drug transfer from compartment i to compartment j. Similarly, the rate constant k e0 , sometimes referred to as k 41 , describes the drug transfer from the first compartment to the effect-site and relates C e to C pl . 8\n\nSchnider et al. proposed a fixed k e0 of 0.456 min −1 for propofol. 9 After a bolus of propofol, the maximum hypnotic effect is observed after a certain time, the time to peak effect ( t peak ). Considering a patient population, which differs in the main confounder's age, weight and height, then t peak is linked to k e0 in a complex way as described by Minto et al. 10 Assuming a fixed k e0 for every patient results in a different t peak depending on the above-mentioned confounders. Vice versa, a fixed t peak leads to different k e0 values. This might be of relevance as some TCI pump manufacturers have implemented a fixed k e0 , whereas others use a fixed t peak in their PK/PD models.\n\nIn effect site mode, a TCI pump first delivers a specific bolus of propofol for induction of anaesthesia, 11 and then the pump stops until an equilibrium between plasma and the effect site is reached: this equilibration occurs at t peak . Finally, the pump delivers an infusion rate, which is calculated to maintain C e . Assuming that a given patient requires a patient-specific (minimum) bolus dose to become unconscious and to achieve an adequate depth of anaesthesia, then this bolus should be independent of the TCI pump used.\n\nIn our department, operation theatres are equipped with different TCI pumps. In clinical practice, we have observed that some patients require a higher (or lower) C e for induction of anaesthesia when using certain TCI pumps. Targeting an initially too low target concentration can make mask ventilation (and intubation) difficult and requires a gradual increase in the target concentration, which can prolong the induction of anaesthesia (and the time with an unsecured airway). Conversely, an initially too high target concentration may lead to the occurrence of a burst suppression EEG and blood pressure decline. Because of the above observation, we undertook an in vitro study to compare the different TCI pumps. Our main objective was to measure the initial propofol bolus delivered for induction of anaesthesia in simulated patients with given combinations of age, sex, height and weight.\n\nMethods\n\nThis manuscript adheres to the applicable STROBE guidelines. As neither patients nor animals were involved in this observational in-vitro study, no ethical approval was required.\n\nFour different TCI pumps (Alaris ® PK by Alaris ® Medical Systems, Basingstoke, Hampshire, United Kingdom; Syramed ® μSP6000 by Arcomed, Kloten, Switzerland; Perfusor ® Space ® by B Braun, Melsungen, Germany; Injectomat TIVA Agilia ® , Fresenius Kabi, Bad Homburg, Germany) were tested from February 2019 to September 2020. The first two pumps use a fixed t peak of 1.6 min and the latter two a fixed k e0 of 0.456 min −1 . All pumps were set in effect site mode using the Schnider model 7 with a target C et of 3.5 μgml −1 . Propofol 2% (Propofol 2% MCT Fresenius, Fresenius Kabi, Bad Homburg, Germany) was infused from a TCI pump into a dish placed on a high precision scale (Kern® EW-620-3NM, Kern&Sohn, Balingen-Frommern, Germany). The weight of the dish and the propofol it contained was measured every second. After correction for the weight of the empty dish, this weight was recorded via serial communication to a laptop. The dose rate of propofol was calculated as the primary outcome using an Excel 2016 spreadsheet (Microsoft, Redmond, Washington, USA). The propofol dose was calculated based on the observation that 1 g of the propofol solution has a volume of 1.018 ml and contains 20.36 mg of propofol. All experiments were performed by the same author (AW).\n\nThe theoretical initial propofol bolus required (loading dose L) was calculated using an in-house developed MATLAB code (MATLAB R2018a, The MathWorks, Natick, Massachusetts, USA) based on the PK/PD described by Shafer. 12\n\nwhere V 1 denotes the volume of the central compartment, A, B, C the fractional pharmacokinetic coefficients and α, β, γ the pharmacokinetic exponents. Further details are explained in the Appendix. The results obtained by the MATLAB code were validated using the software STANPUMP. 13\n\nThe calculated theoretical dose was compared with the actual propofol bolus delivered. To do so, 13 patients were simulated, each with a specific parameter set of age, sex, weight and height (Table 1 ). The first patient represented the ‘typical’ patient of our clinic with an age (54 years), sex (male), height (170 cm) and weight (74 kg), equivalent to the median of the patients anaesthetised in our department in the year 2016. Parameters of the next five patients (Table 1 ) were calculated so as to result both in a t peak of 1.6 min and a k e0 of 0.456 min −1 . We used software developed in house (coded in MATLAB) that applied the algorithm proposed by Minto et al. 10 to calculate t peak and k e0 values that matched each other. Thus, in these five simulated patients, we expected the behaviour of all four TCI pumps to be comparable. For the final seven patients (Table 1 ), we chose specific parameter sets designed to reveal differences between the TCI pumps.\n\nFor each simulated patient and TCI pump, the infusion experiment was performed three times. The average of the three measured propofol boluses was used for further analysis. The measured and calculated propofol boluses were compared as secondary outcomes by calculating the prediction error: 14\n\nwhere A measured and A calculated denote the measured and calculated doses of propofol, respectively.\n\nIn a population-based simulation study, we estimated the (theoretical) induction bolus dose for all patients anaesthetised by our department in the year 2016. To do so, we calculated the propofol induction bolus based on the patient's age, height, weight and sex to obtain a C et of 3.5 μgml −1 using both a fixed t peak and a fixed k e0 approach. Only patients with an age of at least 16 years were included.\n\nStatistical analysis\n\nWe calculated the sample size required to detect a dose difference of 10 mg with an expected standard deviation of the residuals of 2 mg using ANOVA. With four groups (i.e. TCI pumps), a desired power of 0.8 and an alpha of 0.05, the sample size was 3. For each simulated patient, the measured propofol boluses (the average of three runs for each patient and TCI pump) were compared between the four TCI pumps using an ANOVA test (SigmaPlot V 14.0, Inpixon GmbH, Düsseldorf, Germany). Statistical significance was assumed as P less than 0.05. Data are shown as mean ± standard deviation if not otherwise mentioned.\n\nResults\n\nA marginally higher bolus dose was calculated by STANPUMP as compared with our MATLAB code (0.023 ± 0.044 mg for the fixed t peak model and 0.015 ± 0.038 mg for the fixed k e0 model).\n\nFor the ‘typical’ patient (patient no. 1) a propofol bolus between 56.4 ± 1.2 mg (Syramed μSP6000) and 59.7 ± 0.2 mg (Alaris PK) was delivered by the TCI pumps (Fig. 1 ). This reflects the small difference in bolus dose that would be expected between the fixed t peak model (59.4 mg) and the fixed k e0 model (58.3 mg) according to the theoretical calculation (Table 2 ). For the patients 2 to 6, the calculation predicted a marginal difference in bolus dose ranging from 56.9 to 57.6 mg between the pharmacodynamic models, and the TCI pumps delivered boluses between 55.2 and 62.0 mg (Table 2 ). The expected relevant differences were observed in the simulated patients 7 to 13 (Table 2 ). In patient 10, the Perfusor Space delivered a significantly ( P < 0.001) smaller bolus of 72.0 ± 1.0 mg as compared with the Alaris PK (111.9 ± 1.2 mg). There was a similar result in patient 13, with a 64.9 ± 1.6 mg propofol bolus delivered by the Perfusor Space compared with 84.0 ± 0.1 mg from the Alaris PK ( P < 0.001).\n\nFigure 2 shows the time course of the propofol infusion for patient 10, and illustrates the three-phase process. First, a propofol bolus is delivered resulting in a steep increase in the cumulative dose of propofol infused. The gradient of the cumulative dose of propofol over time curve for the Alaris PK pump is half as steep compared with the other three TCI pumps since the induction injection speed is 600 ml h −1 for the former and 1200 ml h −1 for the latter (Figs. 1 and 2 ). Second, after the bolus, the pumps stop until the propofol concentrations in the plasma and brain have equalised. This happens at t peak (in the idealised, model-population like patient). This standstill leads to the formation of a (dose) plateau, which is significantly ( P < 0.001) higher for the Alaria® PK (111.9 ± 1.2 mg) and Syramed μSP6000 (109.6 ± 0.6 mg) as compared with the Perfusor Space (72.0 ± 1.0 mg) and the Injectomat TIVA Agilia TCI pump (75.8 ± 1.0 mg, Fig. 2 ). This difference is caused by the larger propofol bolus delivered by the first two TCI pumps. Third, the TCI pumps begin a constant rate infusion to maintain C et . The gradient of the cumulative dose curve during this third phase is more or less equal for all four TCI pumps, indicating that all calculate the same propofol delivery rate to maintain C e (Figs. 1 and 2 ).\n\nThe prediction error of the four TCI pumps with respect to the initial propofol bolus were in the range between −1.8% and +1% indicating a high precision (Table 2 ).\n\nThe absolute and relative difference in bolus doses for our patient population ( n = 17 655) is shown in Figs. 3 and 4 . The median absolute difference was 6 mg higher with the fixed t peak method than the fixed k e0 method, with half of the patients exhibiting differences of more than 12.9 mg. Similarly, the relative difference in bolus dose was 9.3% higher with the t peak method, with 50% of patients showing a relative difference of more than 17.9%.\n\nDiscussion\n\nThe main finding of our study is that, depending on the combination of age, sex, weight and height, the TCI pumps work almost identically in some virtual patients but they are very different in others. For example, in patient 10, some TCI pumps deliver a propofol bolus that is 1.6 times larger (or smaller) than some other TCI pumps. This is not because of a malfunction of the TCI pumps but can be explained by the laws of pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics: The propofol bolus initially delivered depends critically on the chosen combination of age, sex, height and weight, which are the input parameters of the Schnider PK/PD model. Based on these four values, the TCI pumps calculate the six PK/PD parameters k 10 , k 12 , k 21 , k 13 , k 31 and k e0 . Only k eo differs among TCI pumps. In some, a fixed k e0 value of 0.456 min −1 is used, whereas others calculate an individual k e0 value resulting from a constant t peak value at 1.6 min.\n\nTo get an impression of the clinical relevance, we used the data on age, height, weight and sex of all the patients older than 15 years whom we anaesthetised in 2016. If a TCI pump with a C et of 3.5 μgml −1 had been used for induction in all 17 655 patients, the Perfusor Space and Injectomat TIVA Agilia pump would have administered a median of 6 mg (or 9.3%) less propofol as an induction dose than the Alaris PK or Syramed μSP6000 pump. At first glance, this difference may seem small. Nevertheless, one should consider that in half of the patients, the difference would have been more than 12.9 mg (or 17.9%).\n\nThese details are known to PK/PD experts, 15 – 17 but probably not to the majority of anaesthetists. Schnider 7 , 9 himself published the PK/PD parameter set, including the fixed k e0 , and TCI devices that use a fixed t peak instead should probably be referred to as ‘modified’ Schnider model. Thus, it would be more obvious to clinicans that the difference between the original and modified Schnider models may result in different induction doses.\n\nThe clinical consequences of these different applications of the Schnider model is irrelevant in some patients, especially those where a fixed k e0 will result in a t peak close to 1.6 min (or where a fixed t peak will result in a k e0 close to 0.456 min −1 ). This is true for patients who are short and young, medium-sized and medium age, or tall and old patients. For these, any of the four tested TCI pumps can be used with identical target concentration setting. However, the difference in k e0 becomes clinically important in tall and young, and short and old patients. If we consider a 20-year-old woman with a height of 185 cm and a weight of 86 kg (BMI = 25kgm −2 ), for whom we would normally use an Asena® PK (or Syramed μSP6000) pump with a target concentration of 4.0 μgml −1 and, for some reason, only a Perfusor Space (or Injectomat TIVA Agilia) pump is available: now we must select a target concentration of 5.6 μgml −1 to administer an identical propofol bolus dose for induction of anaesthesia. On the other hand, for the same pump change in an 85-year-old man with a height of 160 cm and a weight of 64 kg (BMI = 25 kgm −2 ), a target concentration of 3.4 μgml −1 must be set.\n\nEven if the same propofol dose is administered, the depth of anaesthesia varies from patient to patient because of pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic variability 18 . As an anaesthetist has no knowledge of a patient's actual pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, it has become part of their core competence to choose a higher or lower target concentration depending on a patient age, height, weight, sex, pre-existing conditions and the situation. On the other hand, it can be assumed that a given patient requires the same amount of propofol to lose consciousness, regardless of the propofol formulation and TCI pump used.\n\nStudies on differences in the performance of TCI pumps with various PK/PD models have been performed in the past, and considerable differences were reported. 15 , 16 , 19 – 21 Although those studies focused on the overall performance, we focussed only on the bolus delivered for induction of anaesthesia. With the four TCI pumps chosen, we noted different induction doses were administered despite apparently using the same Schnider pharmacokinetic model.\n\nWe recommend the standardisation of PK/PD models used for TCI infusion pumps so that the same PK/PD parameters are used, regardless of the branding of the pump used. This standardisation might be imposed either by a regulatory authority or by consensus.\n\nOur study is limited firstly by inaccuracies in the calculation and measurement of the propofol dose delivered. Although there was a difference between the calculated propofol boli when comparing our MATLAB code and the reference programme STANPUMP, this amounted to 0.02 mg and can be considered negligible. While the accuracy, specifically the reproducibility, of the precision scale is 1 mg, this is lower by a factor of 4 for the TCI pumps: according to the manufacturers’ manuals, the accuracy is 0.2 ml (4 mg, Injectomat TIVA Agilia), 3% (∼ 2mg, Syramed μSP6000), or 5% (∼4 mg, Alaris PK and Perfusor Space). The observed differences in propofol boluses can be well explained by the mathematical differences of the two algorithms (fixed t peak vs. fixed k e0 ). In addition, the inaccuracy of the TCI pumps in the majority of patients is smaller than the differences in bolus doses that we observed, which is why we believe that the inaccuracies of the TCI pumps play a subordinate role in the interpretation of the results.\n\nSecondly, the dose of propofol administered was determined in vitro and not in actual patients. However, the latter is technically difficult to achieve, but there is no reason to believe that a pump will deliver a different dose of propofol depending on whether it is delivered into a patient's vein or a Petri dish.\n\nThirdly, the parameters age, sex, height and weight of the virtual patients were specifically selected. These parameters were obtained from Eq. (2) in order to achieve the smallest possible deviations (patients 2 to 6) or the largest possible deviations (patients 7 to 13) between the pumps. However, any other combination of parameters could have been chosen, as the pumps behaved as expected according to Eq. (2).\n\nFourthly, only the four TCI pumps that were available to us were tested. Presumably, however, our results can be transferred to other TCI pumps, which use either a fixed k e0 of 0.456 min −1 or a variable k e0 (corresponding to a fixed t peak of 1.6 min).\n\nConclusions\n\nIf different TCI pumps are used with the Schnider pharmacokinetic model in effect site mode, it cannot be assumed that they behave identically, that is, that they infuse an identical propofol bolus for induction of anaesthesia. Subject to the pharmacodynamic model used ( k eo or t peak ), different doses of propofol can be administered during induction. Depending on patient age, sex, height or weight, these differences in dose can range from negligible variation up to a factor of almost 1.6.",
