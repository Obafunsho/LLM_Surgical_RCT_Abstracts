Atrial structural changes and its enlargement has been shown to increase risk for POAF and it appears earlier and lasts longer ( 3 ). Although POAF is often a transient arrhythmia, its occurrence can have significant clinical consequences, including an increased risk of stroke, hemodynamic instability, prolonged hospital stay, and higher mortality ( 4 ).\n\nProphylaxis of POAF (Role of Amiodarone)\n\nThe prevention of POAF includes beta blocker, statins, class III antiarrhythmics (Amiodarone), corticosteroids, and colchicine ( 4 ). Amiodarone is one of the most commonly used antiarrhythmics for POAF prevention, but study results are contradictory; while some studies show a significant reduction in POAF incidence, others have not found a statistically significant effect ( 4 ). Two meta-analyses focusing on the timing of amiodarone administration found no difference between postoperative or preoperative initiation in patients undergoing CABG. A possible explanation for this is that onset of POAF is typically 2 to 3 days after CABG. Dosage and route of administration of amiodarone were analyzed in meta-analyses by Buckley et al. and Chatterjee et al. respectively, concluding there is no difference between a regimen of oral amiodarone alone or a combination of oral and intravenous amiodarone. The total dosage of amiodarone between 3000-5000 mg is considered optimal for prophylactic effectiveness ( 5 ). Although, even a lower cumulative dose of amiodarone (<3000 mg during the loading phase) could be effective, with fewer adverse events ( 6 ).\n\nPatient stratification\n\nAlthough various prevention strategies are available, there is still no standardized approach in clinical practice for stratifying patients based on their risk of POAF ( 7 ). This study analyzes three validated predictive models (McSPI AF Risk Index, POAF Score, CHA2DS2-VASc Score) to assess their clinical utility in risk assessment and optimization of therapeutic strategies ( 8 ). Nathan et al. in their study favored the McSPI predictive model, which proved superior in predicting POAF after CABG compared to the other two ( 9 ).\n\nObjective\n\nThe objective of this study is to evaluate the effect of postoperative timing of amiodarone administration on the incidence and temporal distribution of POAF in patients undergoing elective CABG. Additionally, the study will assess the clinical value of predictive risk models to enable more precise individualization of therapeutic strategies.\n\nMATERIAL AND METHODS\n\nStudy Design and Population\n\nThis study is a prospective cohort study conducted at Medical Institute Bayer, Tuzla, from 2019 to 2024. The study included patients who underwent elective CABG, and risk stratification for the development of POAF was performed using the McSPI AF risk score and compared with the other two validated scoring systems.\n\nInclusion criteria:\n\nInclusion criteria:\n\nRisk stratification of POAF\n\nThe three validated predictive models in assessing risk stratification for POAF:\n\nMcSPI AF Risk Index\n\nPOAF Score\n\nCHA2DS2-VASc Score\n\nTherapeutic Regimens and POAF Incidence\n\nThe subjects were divided into two therapeutic groups:\n\nAmiodarone Regimen\n\nUpon admission to the intensive care unit:\n\nOutcome Measures\n\nPrimary Outcomes\n\nSecondary Outcomes\n\nStatistical Analysis\n\nStatistical analysis was performed using the Stata 18.0 software package (StataCorp, College Station, TX, USA). Categorical variables were presented as absolute and relative frequencies (n, percent), while continuous variables were presented as mean X+- standard deviation SD) or median with interquartile range, depending on the data distribution. Normality of distribution was tested using the Shapiro-Wilk test. Differences between groups were analysed using the χ2 test or Fisher's exact test for categorical variables and the Student's t- test or Mann-Whitney U test for continuous variables, depending on their distribution. The Kaplan-Meier method with the Peto- Peto-Prentice test to assess early distinction of curves when POAF is most critical was used to analyze the time to onset of POAF. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses were used to assess risk factors and calculate hazard ratios (HR) with 95% con_dence intervals (CI).\n\nStatistical and Power Analysis\n\nSample size estimation was performed using power analysis to ensure sufficient statistical power to detect a clinically significant difference in the incidence of POAF between groups. Based on previous studies, we estimated that the amiodarone group would reach the event of interest in 17.4% of cases, while the control group would have an incidence of POAF of 33%. With the set parameters of type I error (α = 0.05) and type II error (β = 0.20, power = 80%), the minimum required sample size was calculated at 227 subjects per group, or a total of 455 patients for valid statistical analysis.\n\nRESULTS\n\nTable 1 summarizes the baseline characteristics of the patients, including sex, age, body mass index (BMI), presence of hypertension, diabetes, COPD, dyslipidemia, and smoking status. The median CHA2DS2-VASc score was 3 (Q1-Q3: 2-4), while the POAF score was 75 (Q1-Q3: 63-87).\n\nResults show that the incidence of POAF was significantly lower in patients treated with amiodarone (5.95%) compared to the group receiving beta blockers (9.25%).\n\nThis difference was statistically significant according to Fisher's exact test (p = 0.008), suggesting that amiodarone therapy reduces the risk of POAF in patients undergoing CABG.\n\nCumulative incidence rate (IR) of POAF:\n\nKaplan-Meier analysis ( figure 1 .) showed that the time to onset of POAF was significantly different between the treatment groups (Peto-Peto-Prentice test, χ2( 1 ) = 11.44, p = 0.0007). Patients treated with beta blocker developed POAF significantly earlier than those in the Amiodarone group, where the incidence of POAF was shifted to the right on the time scale. These results suggest that Amiodarone in combination with beta blocker not only reduces the incidence of POAF but also significantly delays its onset, which may have clinically significant implications for the postoperative management of patients.\n\nThe Nelson-Aalen cumulative hazard function ( figure 2 .) demonstrated a significant difference in accumulated POAF risk between the treatment groups. In the beta blocker group, the cumulative hazard increased more rapidly, suggesting earlier and more frequent occurrence of POAF, while in the Amiodarone group, the increase was slower. These results support the hypothesis that amiodarone reduces not only the overall incidence of POAF but also the accumulated risk throughout the postoperative period. The reduced hazard in the Amiodarone group was con_rmed by Cox regression (HR = 0.39, 95% CI: 0.23-0.66, p = 0.0004). All these findings suggest a potential benefit of amiodarone in POAF prevention strategies following cardiac surgery.\n\nMultivariate Cox regression analysis was performed to identify independent predictors of POAF. The results of the analysis are shown in Table 3 .\n\nMultivariate Cox regression analysis was used to assess predictors of POAF in patients undergoing CABG. This method allows modeling of time to adverse event, taking into account censored data and simultaneously assessing the influence of multiple covariates. The selection of covariates was based on clinically relevant factors and previous studies suggesting a potential association with POAF. The model was iteratively expanded to include age, comorbidities (dyslipidemia, diabetes, smoking), operative factors (duration of cardiopulmonary bypass and cross-clamp time), and therapeutic strategies (amiodarone vs. beta-blockers). Each change in the model was assessed using the likelihood ratio test, while proportional hazards were confirmed by Schoenfeld residuals. The final model showed a robust association of amiodarone with a reduced risk of POAF (HR = 0.27, p = 0.006), consistent with previous studies. Although older age and metabolic factors suggested a potential impact on POAF, the effects did not reach statistical significance. Also, operative parameters did not show a direct impact, indicating the complex nature of this phenomenon. These results further support the use of amiodarone as a strategy to reduce the risk of POAF in patients undergoing CABG. The results of the analysis are shown in Table 3 , which additionally confirms the significant association of amiodarone with a reduced risk of POAF. Although operative factors such as duration of cardiopulmonary bypass and cross-clamp time included in the analysis, had no significant independent influence, this may indicate a dominant role of other predisposing factors in the development of POAF. In this context, early administration of amiodarone may play a key role in reducing the incidence of POAF in patients undergoing CABG, especially considering its superiority over beta blockers.\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nOur study provides valuable clinical insights into the role of amiodarone in POAF prevention, highlighting its dual effect. Our results suggest that the true potential of amiodarone lies in its ability to reduce incidence and delay the onset of POAF. The incidence of POAF in the beta blocker group was 9.25%, while in the amiodarone group was 5.95%, indicating a relative risk reduction. The overall incidence of POAF in our study was 15.20%. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that amiodarone significantly delayed POAF compared to beta blockers (48h vs. 33h), which may be clinically relevant for postoperative management.\n\nCox regression analysis confirmed that amiodarone reduces the risk of early POAF by 73% (HR = 0.27, 95% CI: 0.10-0.69, p = 0.006), emphasizing its superiority in preventing this complication. Three predictive models (McSPI AF Risk Index, POAF Score, CHA2DS2-VASc) have clinical applicability and can be used depending on patient characteristics (individualized therapeutic approach for high risk patients).\n\nNelson-Aalen analysis showed a significantly slower increase in cumulative risk for POAF in patients treated with amiodarone compared to beta blockers, further confirming its preventive effect. Cox regression analysis demonstrated that patients on amiodarone had a 73% lower risk of developing POAF during hospitalization (HR = 0.27, 95% CI: 0.10-0.69, p = 0.006), reinforcing its efficacy not only in delaying but also in reducing the overall incidence of POAF. These findings suggest that amiodarone is a superior strategy for POAF prevention in patients undergoing CABG, not only because it shifts the timing of arrhythmia onset but also due to its significant reduction in overall incidence, which may play a crucial role in optimizing postoperative management. One of the most significant methodological contributions of this study is emphasizing the importance of stratifying patients based on POAF risk. Although validated predictive models are available, their application in clinical practice is not yet standardized, so early preoperative risk assessment would allow better selection of patients for prophylactic strategies and optimization of therapeutic approaches.\n\nThe three predictive models analyzed in this study have specific clinical value depending on patient characteristics: The POAF Score may be particularly useful in patients with a history of atrial fibrillation, especially if documented. • The McSPI AF Risk Index better predicts risk in patients with multiple perioperative risk factors. The CHA2DS2-VASc Score is most relevant for patients with comorbidities that increase the risk of atrial fibrillation.\n\nIndividualization of POAF Prevention Strategy\n\nNo single model is universally superior, but their combined use may improve risk stratification and enable more precise therapy application ( 10 ). Current clinical practice mainly focuses on POAF prophylaxis during the postoperative period, while preoperative intervention is often overlooked. However, given the pharmacokinetics of amiodarone where absorption and achievement of therapeutic concentrations take time, early administration in high risk patients may be a more effective strategy. The timing of POAF onset has an important clinical impact. Patients who develop POAF early, within the first 48 hours postoperatively, are more likely to experience hemodynamic instability, an increased risk of acute heart failure, a need for inotropic support, and thromboembolic complications. Conversely, late onset POAF (3 to 7 days postoperatively) usually occurs in clinically stable patients, is often transient and asymptomatic, and frequently reverts to sinus rhythm spontaneously. These differences in POAF onset timing emphasize the need for an individualized approach: early POAF requires intensive monitoring and more aggressive therapeutic interventions, whereas late POAF often allows for a more conservative treatment strategy. Our findings are consistent with previous studies but also raise important clinical discussions. Study Mehaffey et al. showed that preoperative administration of amiodarone reduces the incidence of POAF, suggesting that the timing of administration could be a key factor ( 11 ). Chatterjee et al. and Osmanovic et al. demonstrated that both the timing and route of amiodarone administration significantly impact the incidence of POAF, emphasizing the need for optimized perioperative protocols ( 12 , 13 ). Neumann et al. highlight the variability of amiodarone therapeutic regimens, which may explain the different results between studies. Amiodarone has a complex pharmacokinetic profile, characterized by a large volume of distribution and a long half-life, which can range from several weeks to months, resulting in prolonged effects even after discontinuation ( 14 ). The results of our study are in agreement with other studies that confirm the reduction in incidence of POAF with postoperative administration of amiodarone in combination with a beta blocker, but also significantly delay its occurrence, which may have important clinical implications, especially in the postoperative management of patients ( 15 , 16 ). Confirmation of the importance of using amiodarone in the prevention of POAF is the IA recommendation in the new ESC guidelines for its use published in 2024 ( 17 ). Although amiodarone is approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias, it is used off-label for managing atrial fibrillation in both inpatient and outpatient settings. A Cochrane meta-analysis of 33 RCTs similarly showed that perioperative amiodarone significantly reduces POAF incidence after cardiac surgery compared with placebo 19.4% vs. 33.3% (OR=0.43, 95% CI: 0.34-0.54) ( 18 ). No significant differences were observed when amiodarone therapy was initiated preoperatively, on the day of surgery, or the day after surgery. Although oral and intravenous amiodarone regimens similarly reduce POAF risk, the enteral-exclusive regimens have been associated with less bradycardia, hypotension, or QT prolongation ( 12 ). A meta-analysis comparing POAF incidences between patients receiving prophylactic beta blocker or amiodarone therapy found no significant difference ( 19 ). Another meta-analysis found that amiodarone was the only intervention independently associated with a reduction in stroke rate. Therefore, ACC/AHA guidelines do not comment on amiodarone for POAF prevention, whereas the ESC/EACTS guidelines recommendations are Class I for amiodarone or beta blocker for POAF prevention ( 18 , 19 ).\n\nLimitation of the study\n\nThe overall POAF incidence (15.20%) in our study can be partly explained by the limitation of monitoring to the hospitalization period (mean hospital stay: 11 days). Additionally, the POAF detection method may significantly impact the estimated incidence - as continuous ECG monitoring (Holter) was not used, asymptomatic or transient episodes might have gone undetected. Furthermore, variability in POAF incidence reporting depends on the definition of this arrhythmia.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nThe results of our study provide valuable clinical insights into the role of early Amiodarone administration in moderate and high risk patients in preventing POAF and highlight its dual effect. First, Amiodarone in combination with a beta blocker reduces the incidence of POAF, but also delays its onset, which may be clinically significant in the postoperative management of patients undergoing CABG. The occurrence of POAF prolong hospitalization and intensive care unit (ICU) stay and has an impact on long-term cardiovascular outcomes, which is why prevention of POAF is so important. Early preoperative risk stratification of POAF, which allows the selection of patients for prophylactic strategies and optimization of therapeutic approaches, should become a routine part of the preoperative preparation of patients before CABG. None of the risk stratification models for POAF is universally superior, but their combined application may improve risk stratification and allow for more precise application of a prophylactic therapeutic protocol.",
