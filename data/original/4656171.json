  "title": "Significance of Reflux Abolition at the Saphenofemoral Junction in Connection with Stripping and Ablative Methods",
  "abstract": "Saphenous reflux interferes with the physiological decrease in pressure and induces ambulatory venous hypertension. Elimination of reflux is achieved by flush ligation at the incompetent saphenofemoral junction and stripping of the great saphenous vein, which is the basis of the conventional surgical therapy. Endovenous ablative methods substitute stripping by thermal of chemical destruction of the saphenous trunk; they usually refrain from saphenofemoral junction ligation. Short-term and medium-term results up to 5 years, achieved after endovenous ablation without high ligation, are comparable with those after conventional surgery, which questioned the necessity to ligate the incompetent saphenofemoral junction. Nevertheless, clinical symptoms caused by recurrent reflux occur as a rule not earlier than 8 to 10 years after efficient abolition of reflux. Consequently, randomized studies with long-term follow-ups exceeding 10 years are necessary for trustworthy assessment whether it is justified to abstain from saphenofemoral junction ligation.",
