  "title": "Intraoperative Molecular Imaging With Pafolacianine in Resection of Occult Pulmonary Malignancy in the ELUCIDATE Trial",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Clinical studies have demonstrated that intraoperative molecular imaging (IMI) with pafolacianine identifies occult pulmonary lesions that are not identified by preoperative computed tomography or by intraoperative inspection techniques in ~20% of patients. This study describes occult lesion clinical data and evaluates characteristics so that surgeons can better incorporate this emerging technology into clinical decision making.\n\nMETHODS: Participants (n = 100) enrolled in a phase 3 trial of IMI with pafolacianine during pulmonary resection (Enabling Lung Cancer Identification Using Folate Receptor Targeting [ELUCIDATE]; NCT04241315 ) were identified. Participants underwent preoperative computed tomography with 1.25-mm slices. Patient and lesion characteristics were analyzed. Positive predictive value and false positive rates were tabulated for IMI fluorescent lesions, with predictors of malignant vs benign occult lesions described.\n\nRESULTS: IMI identified 29 occult lesions in 23 (23%) participants. Seventeen of 29 (58%) lesions were identified within the same lobe as known lesions; 12 of 29 (42%) were identified in a different lobe from the suspicious nodule known by preoperative assessment. Twenty-three of 29 (79%) of occult lesions found by IMI were resected with an additional wedge resection. Ten of 29 (34%) lesions identified by IMI were malignant. There was no additional morbidity in participants with lesions resected. With pafolacianine, 7 participants had a synchronous primary stage I lung cancer identified, and 1 participant had additional metastases identified.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: IMI with pafolacianine identifies occult malignant lesions during pulmonary resection despite thorough preoperative imaging and intraoperative assessment by experienced surgeons.",

The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board at each enrolling center as part of the original clinical trial agreements. The full protocol can be found in the trial report. 6 Written informed consent, including consent for data publication, was obtained from each participant before initiating screening procedures. Briefly, participants receiving pafolacianine and undergoing IMI were identified from the ELUCIDATE database. Participants received 0.025 mg/kg of pafolacianine delivered intravenously over 60 minutes within 1 to 24 hours before surgery and IMI. All participants underwent a high-resolution computed tomographic (CT) scan with at least 1.25-mm axial cuts before enrollment. Otherwise, occult lesions identified exclusively by IMI were tallied. Occult lesions were defined as nodules that were not identified on preoperative imaging or by traditional intraoperative techniques, such as visual inspection or palpation techniques. All preoperative imaging was reviewed by institutional radiologists and underwent independent central review by a qualified thoracic surgeon. Variables that could possibly predict malignancy in occult lesions were incorporated into multivariable models and included age at the time of resection, sex, preoperatively known tumor location, preoperatively known tumor size, clinical stage, occult lesion size, occult lesion location, pathologic stage, and history of previous cancers.\n\nSTATISTICAL ANALYSIS.\n\nThis is primarily a descriptive report with data expressed in median values with interquartile ranges or percentages, unless otherwise noted. Positive predictive value and false positive rate were tabulated for lesions based on fluorescence alone. Finally, predictors of malignant occult lesions (true positives) versus benign occult lesions (false positives) were examined. Statistical analyses were performed using Sigma Plot for Windows Version 15.\n\nRESULTS\n\nPARTICIPANT CHARACTERISTICS.\n\nA total of 100 participants who received pafolacianine in ELUCIDATE and were randomized to near-infrared (NIR) imaging were included. A comprehensive summary of participant and primary lesion characteristics is provided in Table 1 . Most participants had stage I or II NSCLC (n = 64), with a median primary tumor size of 13 mm in greatest dimension. The next most common diagnosis was metastatic disease to the lungs (n = 21). Preoperative CT scans were completed at an average of 6.77 weeks (range, 2–15 weeks) before surgery.\n\nOCCULT LESION CHARACTERISTICS.\n\nIn 23 participants, 29 occult lesions were resected after being identified exclusively by IMI ( Figure ). Twenty-one participants had a single additional lesion identified and resected, 1 participant had 2 additional lesions, and 1 participant had 4 lesions ( Tables 2 , 3 ). Most occult lesions were less than 1 cm (n = 15; 53%); however, they ranged in size from 0.2 cm to 2.0 cm (median, 0.5 cm). Those resected lesions that contained no identifiable disease process on final pathologic review were not measured ( Table 3 ).\n\nSeventeen (58%) of those 29 occult lesions identified solely with IMI were within the same lobe as primary nodules identified by preoperative CT scans, and 12 (42%) were found in a different lobe ( Table 2 ). These otherwise occult lesions were most commonly resected with an additional wedge resection (23 of 29 lesions; 79%). The remaining (6 of 29 occult lesions; 21%) were included in a single resection, which also included the known lung lesion (5 lobectomies, 1 segmentectomy) ( Table 3 ). On review of the investigator questionnaire, there was no clear perioperative morbidity associated with resection of occult lesions and no increase in pulmonary complications, as determined by safety event data review.\n\nOn histopathologic review of the 29 lesions identified by IMI, 7 (24%) were invasive pulmonary adenocarcinoma, 3 (10%) were metastases from other primary sites, 1 (3%) was adenocarcinoma in situ, and 18 (62%) were benign lesions ( Table 3 ). Of the 7 occult NSCLCs identified, 4 measured greater than 1.0 cm (1.0 cm, 1.1 cm, 1.8 cm, and 2.0 cm), and each of these lesions had predominantly lepidic histologic features. Of the 18 benign lesions, 15 (83%) were benign tissue, 2 (11%) were granulomas, and 1 (6%) was organizing pneumonia.\n\nFour of 8 participants with malignant occult lesions found by IMI had lesions located in a different lobe, and all these lesions were removed by wedge resection ( Table 2 ). The other 4 participants had occult malignant lesions within the same lobe as the known tumor; 2 lesions were managed with wedge resection, and 2 lesions were included during lobectomy.\n\nAn independent central review of the preoperative CT scan was completed for participants with a malignant occult lesion. Of the 10 malignant lesions discovered with pafolacianine, none were found in retrospective review by the independent reviewer and further were not identified in the original radiology report and by the surgeon review of the scans.\n\nTEST CHARACTERISTICS.\n\nThe true positive rate of fluorescence predicting malignancy (invasive NSCLC or metastases from a distant primary tumor) was found to be 37%, with 1 lesion identified as true positive for adenocarcinoma in situ. The positive predictive value was 38% of malignancy in occult lesions identified with IMI. True negative and false negative rates could not be calculated because otherwise healthy tissue was not resected for purposes of establishing a negative control.\n\nPREDICTORS OF OCCULT MALIGNANCY.\n\nUnivariate analysis was performed to understand better which participant and primary lesion variables predicted malignancy in occult lesions identified by IMI. We found no significant relationships between any pair of variables analyzed ( Table 4 ).\n\nCOMMENT\n\nIMI is an emerging technique that provides real-time, visual information to improve intraoperative decision making by the surgeon. In this report, we expand on the previously described ELUCIDATE trial, which is a stage 3 multicenter trial involving IMI with the folate receptor–targeted agent, pafolacianine. We provide further analysis pertaining to those additional, nontarget lesions identified exclusively by IMI, and not by traditional preoperative and intraoperative techniques—“occult lesions.” The goal of this report is to provide data so that thoracic surgeons can understand the clinical relevance of such fluorescent lesions more clearly and, in turn, can better incorporate IMI data into established decision-making algorithms and clinical acumen.\n\nPrevious data from clinical experiences with pafolacianine-based IMI for NSCLC suggested that 26% to 53% of patients derive clinical benefits. 6 , 7 These benefits have fallen into 3 general categories marked by improvements in the following: (1) localization of small, subpleural, or subsolid lesions; (2) detection of close or positive margins during sublobar resection; and (3) identification of otherwise occult malignant lesions at the time of resection.\n\nIn this report, we reexamine the ELUCIDATE cohort and further describe data on occult lesions that were identified exclusively by IMI. In this cohort of 100 participants, 23 participants were found to have additional lesions. Twentynine lesions were found in total, 10 (34%) of which represented additional malignancies. Seven lesions were considered synchronous primary lung cancers (adenocarcinoma), and 3 were metastatic lesions from a patient with a history of a chordoma. Occult lesions were most frequently initially managed with wedge resection (26 of 29), which was found to add negligible morbidity on review of trial questionnaires and analysis of safety data. For incidentally identified NSCLC in the same lobe as the preoperatively known lesion (T3 lesions), surgeons participating in ELUCIDATE used lobectomy (n = 2) or wedge resection (n = 2). For NSCLC in a different lobe (n = 4) than that of preoperatively known lesions (T4 lesions), the additional lesion was managed by sublobar resection ( Table 3 ). Although this was the observed trend, we recognize that management of occult malignant lesions identified by IMI will be nuanced and patient-specific. In those circumstances in which occult lesions were metastases originating from distant sites or benign lesions, wedge resection was typically performed. Unfortunately, we could not identify predictors of malignancy in our univariate analysis, likely because the initial trial design of ELUCIDATE was not powered for such analyses. Given the lack of predictors of malignancy in occult lesions, surgeons identifying occult lesions will need to make management decisions on the basis of clinical risk factors and frozen section analysis.\n\nThe finding of additional malignant occult lesions in ELUCIDATE in 8% of patients was similar to the experience observed in the phase 1 trial, 11 which found occult lesions in 10% of patients, and was closely matched to the multicenter phase 2 trial, 7 which found malignant occult lesions in 8% of patients. Furthermore, a recent “real-world” experience from the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (Pittsburgh, PA) reported that malignant occult lesions were identified in 8% of patients. 12 The rate of detection for occult malignant lesions in ELUCIDATE and in other experiences reported with pafolacianine falls within the frequency of occult lesion rates of 8% to 9% reported in the literature. 13\n\nAlthough IMI with pafolacianine indeed does identify otherwise occult malignancies, it is important to acknowledge that the clinical impact of resection remains uncertain. Previous human experiences involving IMI are limited. For example, phase 1 and phase 2 trials were non-randomized experiences focused on feasibility, and it is therefore difficult to draw objective conclusions on the basis of improvements in overall or disease-free survivorship. 1 , 4 , 7 With regard to the randomized phase 3 trial (ELUCIDATE), the median follow-up period is only 2 years. 6 In the absence of these critical data, it is unclear whether resection of additional lesions is of oncologic benefit, particularly in the case of identifying synchronous NSCLC. Interestingly, there is a recent report involving indocyanine green, a similar, but nonspecific, NIR imaging agent, which suggests that resection of additional lesions improves disease-free survival during metastasectomy. 14\n\nIn terms of practicality, IMI with pafolacianine requires only minor modifications to standard workflow. In most scenarios, pafolacianine was delivered preoperatively in the holding area, with 95% of patients completing the infusion. Toxicity was minimal, as previously noted. 6 Intraoperatively, molecular imaging required a median time of 2 minutes (maximum, 23 minutes). During traditional video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery, most participating surgeons used an NIR camera, thus no additional ports were required. For those surgeons using robotic-assisted thoracoscopic surgery techniques, in general participating surgeons initially identified and marked lesions using the specialized NIR camera systems and then proceeded with robotic resection. Newer-generation cameras and robots will have the added ability to identify and detect pafolacianine.\n\nAlthough IMI with pafolacianine provides a safe and practical approach to identify otherwise occult malignancies at the time of pulmonary resection, long-term benefits are unclear at this time. As such, we think it is important to emphasize that IMI was developed to provide additional data to the surgeon, and not to replace surgeon’s decision making. Intraoperative fluorescent feedback with IMI should serve as a supplement to traditional modalities such as preoperative imaging, intraoperative cues, and clinical variables. Potential benefits of resecting additional malignant lesions must be balanced with considerations of unnecessary parenchymal resection in circumstances of “false positives” and the extent of additional resection required. In addition, the surgeon should consider the clinical impact when the primary diagnosis is early-stage lung cancer vs pulmonary metastases. This report provides additional data so that the surgeon can better determine whether resection of additional lesions identified by IMI is warranted.",
