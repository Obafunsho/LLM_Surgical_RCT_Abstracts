  "title": "Continuous Vital Sign Monitoring at the Surgical Ward for Improved Outcomes After Major Noncardiac Surgery: A Randomized Clinical Trial",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND:: Complications occur in a third of patients after major noncardiac surgery and are often preceded by vital sign deviations undetected by current vital sign monitoring practice, despite major advances in surgical and perioperative care. Continuous wireless vital sign monitoring with real-time alerts may allow for a reduction of vital sign abnormalities and complications.\n\nMETHODS:: Adult patients undergoing major noncardiac surgery were included and randomized to either standard of care (manual intermittent vital sign monitoring) vs standard of care plus continuous wireless vital sign monitoring with real-time vital sign alerts to staff smartphones at the general postoperative ward. The primary outcome was cumulative duration of severe vital sign deviations, including desaturation, tachy- and bradycardia, tachy- and bradypnea, hypo- and hypertension. Secondary outcomes included adverse events within 30 days. Patients and outcome assessors were blinded to the randomization.\n\nRESULTS:: Four hundred patients were randomized, with 200 in the intervention and 200 in the control group, respectively. Median [interquartile range (IQR)] duration of severely deviating vital signs was 60 [25–136] vs 76 [28–192] min/d in the intervention versus control group, respectively ( P = .19). Duration of Sp o 2 <88% had a mean reduction of 47 minutes per day (95% confidence interval [CI], 18–80, P = .02). Adverse events occurred in 42.5% vs 31.5% of patients within 30 days ( P = .02), and serious adverse events in 34.5% vs 29.5% ( P = .39).\n\nCONCLUSIONS:: Continuous vital sign monitoring with real-time staff alerts did not significantly reduce cumulative severe vital sign deviations in this setup. Significant reductions in desaturations and adverse events were found, giving evidence to future studies in the use of continuous vital sign monitoring to improve patient outcomes.",

Mølgaard, date of registration: November 19, 2020) before patient enrollment. The trial was conducted in surgical departments of 2 major university hospitals (Copenhagen University Hospital – Rigshospitalet and Copenhagen University Hospital – Bispebjerg and Frederiksberg) with a combined 1.700 beds capacity. Staff at all participating departments were given information and instruction in how to use the system before patient randomization.\n\nWritten informed consent was obtained from all subjects, and the study was conducted in accordance with the principles of the Helsinki Declaration. Further, the study was performed in alignment with Good Clinical Practice (GCP) guidelines, which was monitored by the GCP monitoring unit of the Capital Region of Denmark. Safety aspects of the trial were submitted as yearly reports to the relevant oversight authorities. A predefined interim analysis after randomization of 200 (50%) patients was performed to assess safety and study feasibility.\n\nParticipants\n\nPatients ≥50 years were eligible for inclusion if they were admitted for elective major abdominal, vascular arterial, urologic, or orthopedic surgery, with an expected surgical duration of ≥2 hours in general anesthesia and ≥2 expected overnight stays. Patients were excluded if they were unable/unwilling to give informed consent, had a pacemaker or implantable cardioverter defibrillator, or were allergic to sensor materials. See Supplemental Digital Content, Table 1, https://links.lww.com/AA/F351 for a complete list of inclusion and exclusion criteria.\n\nAll patients were treated according to departmental standard-of-care, including well-established enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) procedure-specific protocols. 24 In the department, there was a nurse-patient ratio of approximately 1:3 (daytime) and 1:8 (night).\n\nProcedures\n\nPatients provided oral and written informed consent during their preoperative visit. A 6-block randomization key was generated via www.sealedenvelope.com and included stratification by study site. Due to the nature of the study, hospital staff were not blinded to the randomization. Patients were setup with monitoring equipment from arrival at the surgical ward, and we did not use the system during the patients’ stay in the postanesthesia care unit (see Supplemental Digital Content, Figure 1, https://links.lww.com/AA/F351 ). The patients not randomized within 24 hours of transfer from postanesthesia care unit, or those declining monitoring after surgery for any reason, were pulled out and never randomized.\n\nPatients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either:\n\nIntervention\n\nThe CVSMA system consisted of 3 overall components: wireless vital sign sensors, an algorithmic bundle analyzing vital sign (an artificial intelligence), and a graphic user interface installed on the staff mobile devices receiving vital sign information and alerts in real-time.\n\nVital Sign Sensors\n\nThree wireless, patient-worn devices were used, all CE/FDA approved, and validated in a previous study 25 : a single-lead ECG patch (Lifetouch, Isansys) measuring heart rate (HR) and respiration frequency (RF) every minute, a pulse-oximeter (Nonin Wristox 3150, Nonin Medical Inc) measuring peripheral oxygen saturation (Sp o 2 ) every minute, and a cuff-based blood pressure monitor (TM-2441, A&D Medical) measuring blood pressure (BP) every 30 minutes from 7 am - 10 pm and every hour from 10 pm to 7 a. m (See Supplemental Digital Content, Figure 2, https://links.lww.com/AA/F351 for an illustration of how devices were attached to a patient).\n\nAnalysis\n\nData were transmitted via Bluetooth and hospital Wi-Fi to a server for algorithmic processing (proprietary). The algorithm bundle continuously monitors vital signs and issues an alert if a parameter remains outside predefined thresholds for a specified duration, while filtering out transient or spurious deviations. The WARD-CSS alert criteria are based on NEWS criteria in combination with a duration dimension, to allow for spontaneous resolution of deviations, which in turn reduces the number of alerts. The alert criteria are detailed in Supplemental Digital Content, Table 2, https://links.lww.com/AA/F351 .\n\nMobile Device\n\nAfter data processing, both real-time vital sign values and alerts for patients in the intervention group were sent to a purpose-built, smartphone-based app that gives clinical staff continuous access to patients’ vital sign status in real-time and issues alerts if sustained deviations criteria are fulfilled (see Supplemental Digital Content, Table 2, https://links.lww.com/AA/F351 ). Clinical staff were used to working with smartphone-based devices for documenting medicine administrations and registering results of manual vital sign monitoring, and the WARD-CSS was primarily running on the same devices.\n\nThe WARD-CSS is a clinical support system and not a decision tool, and hence, did not specifically suggest corrective actions is case of alerts, but nurses were advised to use standard clinical escalation-of-care protocols (eg. in case of desaturation: to improve patient positioning, give oxygen supplement, suction if needed, or further diagnostic work-up including requesting assistance). All patients were allowed to remove devices for comfort, and to give indications of data quality and patient satisfaction with a comprehensive system.\n\nData Sources\n\nVital sign data were collected from the CVSMA system server hosted by the hospital. Patient electronic health records were reviewed manually for adverse events by physicians blinded to the randomization allocation using a prespecified outcome-manual based on international diagnostic criteria (Supplemental Digital Content, Table 3, https://links.lww.com/AA/F351 ), where SAE was defined according to International Conference on Harmonization-GCP criteria. 26\n\nOutcomes\n\nThe primary outcome was the total duration of severely deviating vital signs in minutes per 24 hours outside the defined composite outcome: either Desaturation (Sp o 2 < 85%), Bradypnea (RF ≤ 5 min –1 ), tachypnea (RF ≥ 24 min –1 ), bradycardia (HR < 30), tachycardia (HR > 130 min –1 ), hypotension (SBP <91), hypertension (SBP ≥220 mm Hg), OR a combination of hypotension (SBP <100 mm Hg) with simultaneous tachycardia (HR > 110 min –1 ) OR bradycardia (HR < 50 min –1 ) OR desaturation (Sp o 2 < 92%) for the entire monitoring period.\n\nOne secondary outcome was the frequency of sustained vital sign deviations, and their duration, as prespecified in the WARD-CSS alert criteria (Supplemental Digital Content, Table 3, https://links.lww.com/AA/F351 ). The other secondary outcome was the incidence of adverse events (both adverse events and SAE), comprehensive complication index (CCI), 27 ICU admission, and mortality within 30 postoperative days. Tertiary outcomes were hospital length of stay and AE and SAE within 7 days.\n\nData Processing\n\nAll data were analyzed as -minute time-series data. Vital sign values were preprocessed before analysis to reduce the number of artifacts. For instance, noisy data evaluated using raw pulse-plethysmograph data were discarded, impossible values (SBP < DBP), and values with large disagreements between sensors (comparing heart rate information from the ECG and PPG signals). BP measurements were only done intermittently, and followingly each BP measurement was extrapolated forward for a maximum of 30 minutes.\n\nTo account for varying lengths of monitoring, vital sign deviations were calculated per 24 hours of monitoring time. Similarly, the number of alerts was calculated as the number of alarms per 24 hours.\n\nStatistical Analysis\n\nSample size calculation was based on data from previous observational studies, 28 from which we constructed a synthetic dataset with a 50% reduction in duration of severely deviating vital signs—from median [interquartile range {IQR}] 63 minutes [8–3251] to 32 minutes [4–1626]. These data were used as input in a nonparametric model for sample size calculation by Happ et al. 29 with a power of 80% and an alpha of 0.05, resulting in a sample size of 384 patients in a 1:1 intervention/control ratio.\n\nAnalyses were performed on an intention-to-treat (ITT) basis. In addition, a per-protocol analysis evaluated patients with at least 12 hours of monitoring. To be included in the per-protocol intervention-population, patients with vital value alerts had to have at least 1 alert responded to by the staff, which was used as a proxy for nurse engagement with the WARD-CSS. This criterion was chosen as an objective measure that WARD-CSS was integrated into the care process, as the use of the monitoring app represented a new element in the nurses’ workflow.\n\nContinuous data were tested with the Mann-Whitney U test, categorical alert data with Fisher exact test, and time-to-event with Cox proportional-hazards ratio.\n\nResults are reported as either median with interquartile ranges or as mean-difference with 95% confidence intervals.\n\nData analyses were performed in R v. 4.2.2, and Python v. 3.9.7 (packages pandas v. 1.5.2 and lifeline v. 0.27.4, with matplotlib v. 3.5.3) and were validated by an independent, blinded researcher.\n\nRESULTS\n\nPatients\n\nBetween January 2021 and October 2022, 1391 patients fulfilled the inclusion criteria and had no exclusion criteria, of which 400 patients were randomized and included in the final analysis (figure 1 ). The median age was 70 years, and 65% were males. The most frequent procedure was abdominal surgery (72%), followed by arterial vascular (15%), urologic (12%) and orthopedic surgery (1%). Other baseline characteristics are described in Table 1 .\n\nData Availability\n\nThe patient monitoring intervention was started a median of 13 hours [IQR 1 hour–17 hours] after arrival at the general ward, and the median monitoring duration was 2 days 20 hours [IQR, 1 day 20 hours–4 days 1 hours] and 2 days 3 hours [1 day 1 hour–4 days 2 hours] for the intervention group and control group respectively. The median amount of data acquisition (the duration of registered data compared with the time the device was active) was 95% of the total monitored duration [75%–99%] from the single-lead ECG patch, 50% [34%–70%] from the pulse-oximeter, and 20% [0%–46%] from the blood pressure monitor.\n\nPrimary Outcome\n\nThe median duration of severely deviating vital signs was 60 minutes per 24 hours [25–136] for the intervention group and 76 minutes per 24 hours [28–192] for the control group (mean difference 20 minutes per 24 hours (95% confidence interval [CI], −20 to 60); P = .19).\n\nSecondary Outcomes\n\nFor the individual components in the primary outcome, there were no significant differences between the groups (Table 2 ). A significantly shorter duration of Sp o 2 < 92% (mean difference 90 minutes per 24 hours (95% CI, 28–152); P = .008) and Sp o 2 < 88% (mean difference 47 minutes per 24 hours (95% CI, 18–80); P = .02) were recorded in the intervention group. (Table 2 ). There was no difference in the number of patients with sustained vital sign deviations (see Table 3 ).\n\nAt postoperative day 30, 1 or more AE had occurred in 31.5 % of participants in the intervention group vs 42.5 % of participants in the control group ( P = .03), and similarly at day 30, SAEs had occurred in 29.5 % of patients in the intervention group vs 34.5 % of patients in the control group ( P = .39).\n\nThe median length of stay was 5 days [3 days–7 days] for the intervention group vs 6 days [3 days–8 days] for the control group. Median CCI for the intervention group was 0 [IQR 0–22.6] vs 8.7 [IQR 0–24.7] for the control group ( P = .18).\n\nSAEs and tertiary outcomes are detailed in figure 2 a and Supplemental Digital Content, Tables 5–7, https://links.lww.com/AA/F351 .\n\nPerprotocol Analysis\n\nSixty-one (30.5%) intervention and 14 (7%) control patients were excluded from the protocol analysis patients due to premature termination of monitoring, and/or no documentation of nurses engaging with the app (n = 56) (see figure 1 for details), leaving 139 intervention and 186 control patients for analysis.\n\nFor the primary outcome, there was a mean difference of 9 minutes per 24 hours (95% CI, −33 to 52). For details, see Supplemental Digital Content, Tables 8a and 8b, https://links.lww.com/AA/F351 .\n\nOn postoperative day 30, 46 (33.1%) vs 78 (41.9%) had developed an AE. For SAEs, they occurred in 39 (28.1%) vs 64 (34.4%)—intervention and control group, respectively. See Supplemental Digital Content, Figure 3 and 4, https://links.lww.com/AA/F351 .\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nThis randomized clinical trial found no significant difference between patients monitored with CVSMA plus standard care versus standard care alone regarding the cumulated duration of severely deviating vital signs after major surgery.\n\nHowever, significantly shorter durations of desaturations of median 90 minutes for Sp o 2 < 92% and 60 minutes for Sp o 2 < 88% were seen in the intervention group. Significantly fewer AEs also occurred in the intervention group 31.5 % vs 42.5%, but not of SAEs (29.5% vs 34.0% intervention versus control, respectively)\n\nAs opposed to other studies of CVSMA focusing on clinical outcomes such as length of stay and ICU admission, 15 our primary outcome was a composite measure of duration of severe vital sign derangement, to reflect the intervention effect on a heterogenous group of cardio-respiratory vital signs. Since the WARD -CSS system relays information of deviations in vital sign values to patient-care staff, we expected that vital signs would be impacted the most. One of the clinically important secondary outcomes was a composite measure of “any SAE,” a patient endured, which was chosen to capture patient-related outcome at an earlier stage than ICU admission. Although the relationship between vital sign deviations and patient-related outcomes has not been fully elucidated, this trial attempts to take a step in this direction.\n\nThe logic behind CVSMA stems from the assumption that postoperative SAEs are preceded by increasing physiologic instability before clinical detection of SAEs, 30 – 32 or that deviating physiology in itself inflicts injury such as hypotension leading to myocardial injury. 33 , 34 In either case, directing staff attention to undesirable physiology could have a dual impact by either helping to detect early signs of SAEs or to avoid deteriorating patient physiology. The presented findings supplement the growing body of evidence on the use of CVSMA to potentially improve postoperative outcomes. 15 , 35 , 36 A recent propensity-matched retrospective study of more than 34,000 surgical patients found that wireless monitoring of vital sign values resulted in reduced ICU admission or mortality (12.8% vs 37.9%), and shorter hospital length of stay (3.31 vs 4.19 days). 18\n\nThese findings, together with this study, support a recent meta-analysis, where CVSMA showed a trend toward benefit in the form of reduced risk of rapid response or cardiac arrest team activation(risk ratio: 0.84 (95% CI, 0.69–1.01)), although no definitive conclusion were reached due to the lack of large and rigorous RCTs. 15\n\nCVMSA systems are complex interventions with many potential points-of-failure such as data-connectivity, 37 , 38 artifact removal, 38 staff compliance 38 , 39 and adverse impact on perceived staff workload. 37 , 38 Thus, even though the technology may collect all vital sign data, the algorithms correctly detect important conditions, and data is sent correctly to the nurses; the engagement of the staff may be low, and the chosen interventions may not be effective. A study found that while patients were positive about monitoring, staff involvement and engagement remained challenging, 39 and limited evidence exists concerning how hospital-staff prefer to use CVSMA systems. Based on human-factors testing, nursing staff considered the WARD-CSS app intuitive. In the current study, nurses did not mark in the app that they had acknowledged an alert in 28% of patient cases, and although we cannot exclude that the alert had resulted in an action in these cases, it highlights an area for improvement. The importance of engagement is supported by the increased reduction of SAE’s in the “per protocol analysis,” compared to the “intention-to-treat analysis” when “nonresponders” were removed. These observations underscore the need to refine user interfaces and integrate such systems more seamlessly into clinical workflows, ensuring that they meet the dynamic demands of the work environment.” Another point to consider is the choice of outcome measures in future trials. In hindsight, the primary outcome of combined vital sign deviations may have been suboptimal because some vital signs—such as heart rate in cases of infection or hypovolemia—require more time to normalize even with adequate corrective interventions, while others, like desaturations, can be corrected more quickly. On the other hand, end points such as ICU admission or death, may lack the sensitivity needed to detect clinically meaningful improvements or demand very large sample sizes. This study reports the number of SAE and AE, which may provide a more sensitive measure of the intervention’s impact.\n\nA key strength of this study is the randomized design and testing in a normal clinical setting with well-implemented enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) protocols. To further improve the external validity for a CVSMA that is thought to work alongside normal clinical practice, this trial included a wide range of patient types, and the trial did not include specific suggestions for interventions, leaving nurses free to use the app, and intervene however they saw fit. We conducted both pretraining of nurses and a run-in training phase on the use of WARD-CSS before randomizing patients, where the WARD-CSS was reported as being easy to use.\n\nThe high SAE rate despite being in an ERAS setting, reflects the fact that most procedures were major abdominal, with similar SAE rates as in previous publications. 4 , 28\n\nWe used thresholds for vital value deterioration that are based on the NEWS thresholds, with a minimum duration criteria adapted for continuous monitoring systems to improve the interpretability of the system, 40 as staff would be acquainted with the majority of thresholds.\n\nLimitations included a relatively high number of patients not consenting to the study, opting-out before randomization, or after a short monitoring duration, where the main reason for opting-out was equipment discomfort. Data acquisition was not optimal for the oximeter and cuff-based blood pressure monitor due to patient discomfort. We tried to address each patient’s concern, including allowing them to keep only 1 device on if the alternative was to opt-out completely, we also missed early postoperative data, by not starting monitoring in the moment patients arrive in the ward. Future trials should take great care in deciding which devices agree with patients, since choosing the wrong device can make patients withdraw from the study altogether. In the current study, the monitoring duration was restricted to a maximum of 5 days due to device battery constraints, and additional effects from longer monitoring periods can be hypothesized. Sample size calculation was based on a 50% reduction in duration of severely deviating vital sign values which was not based on prior pilot studies and larger future trials are needed to establish this finding. Using the information gained in this trial to do a post hoc power calculation on the secondary outcome of SAE at day 7 and 30 results in a power of 39.9% and 18.6%, respectively, reflecting that the trial was underpowered to detect a clinically relevant difference.\n\nIn conclusion, continuous vital sign monitoring with real-time staff-alerts did not significantly reduce cumulative severe vital sign deviations, however, significant reductions in desaturations and AEs were found. These findings provide valuable insights into the effect of continuous monitoring in postoperative care. They highlight the need for larger trials with extended follow-up to further evaluate the impact of continuous monitoring on longer-term postoperative patient outcomes that may not be apparent in the immediate postoperative period.\n\nDISCLOSURES\n\nConflicts of Interest: C.
