  "title": "Virtual reality distraction for reducing acute postoperative pain after hip arthroplasty: a randomized trial",
  "abstract": "Background:: Relaxation and distraction provided by virtual reality presentations might be analgesic and reduce the need for opioid analgesia. We tested the hypothesis that a virtual reality program (AppliedVR, Los Angeles, CA) decreases acute postoperative pain and opioid requirements in patients recovering from hip arthroplasty. We also evaluated whether virtual reality distraction improves patient mobility and reduces the need for antiemetics.\n\nMethods:: We evaluated 106 adults who were recovering from elective primary total hip arthroplasty. Participating patients were randomized to 2–8-minute-long three-dimensional immersive virtual reality relaxation and distraction video presentations (e.g., guided breathing exercises, games, mindfulness) or to two-dimensional presentations of nature short films (e.g., forest wildlife) with neutral music that was chosen to be neither overly relaxing nor distracting, presented through identical headsets. Our primary outcome was pain after virtual reality or sham video presentations, adjusted for pre-treatment scores. Secondary outcomes included total opioid consumption, pain scores obtained per routine by nurse staff, perception of video system usability, and pain one week after hospital discharge.\n\nResults:: 52 patients were randomized to virtual reality distraction and relaxation, and 54 were assigned to two-dimensional sham presentations. Virtual reality presentations were not found to affect pain scores, with an estimated difference in means (virtual reality minus sham video) of −0.1 points [95% CI: −0.5, 0.2, P=0.391] on a 0–10 scale, with 10 being the worst. The mean [SE] after-intervention pain score was estimated to be 3.4 [0.3] in the virtual reality group and 3.5 [0.2] in the reference group. Virtual reality treatment was not found to affect postoperative opioid consumption in mg morphine equivalents, with estimated ratio of geometric means (virtual reality/sham video) of 1.2 [95% CI: 0.6, 2.1, P=0.608]. Virtual reality presentations were not found to reduce pain scores collected every 4 hours by nursing staff, with estimated difference in means of 0.1 points [95% CI:−0.9, 0.7, P=0.768].\n\nConclusions:: We did not observe statistically significant or clinically meaningful reductions in average pain scores or opioid consumption. As used in our trial, virtual reality did not reduce acute postoperative pain.",
