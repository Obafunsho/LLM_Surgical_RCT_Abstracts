  "title": "Evaluation of functional and aesthetic outcomes of free dermal fat graft versus superficial musculoaponeurotic system flap after superficial parotidectomy: randomized clinical trial",
  "abstract": "Background: Parotidectomy is the standard procedure for treatment of many parotid lesions; however, it has several drawbacks. Facial asymmetry and Frey’s syndrome are the most annoying complications to patients. Insertion of interpositioning grafts into the parotidectomy bed can decrease these complications significantly. Free dermal fat graft (FDFG) and superficial musculoaponeurotic system (SMAS) flap have very promising results. This RCT aimed to compare these two techniques regarding functional and aesthetic outcomes.\n\nMethods: Between February 2016 and October 2021, adult patients undergoing superficial conservative parotidectomy in a single centre for a benign indication were randomized into two equal groups using a closed envelope method. In one group, FDFG was inserted at the parotidectomy bed, whereas, in the other group, SMAS flap was performed. Preoperative, operative, and postoperative data were recorded and analysed. The primary outcome was the development of Frey's syndrome.\n\nResults: Seventy-eight patients were randomized into two equal groups of 39 patients. There was no significant difference between the two groups regarding development of Frey's syndrome. There was no significant statistical difference between study groups regarding demographic data, co-morbidities, parotid pathologies, specimen volumes, total operating time, and postoperative complications. A tendency for over correction was observed in FDFG and under correction in SMAS flap. There was no statistically significant difference between the study groups regarding the patients’ aesthetic satisfaction with the majority displaying excellent satisfaction with no poor results.\n\nConclusion: FDFG and SMAS flap are simple, rapid, and reliable procedures and are effective in improving both functional and aesthetic outcomes post-parotidectomy. They have comparable results; however, selection of either procedure can be determined according to patient and tumour characteristics.

  "full_text": "Introduction\n\nTumours of the parotid gland account for 2–3 per cent of all neoplasms of the head and neck, and up to 70–85 per cent of all salivary gland tumours. Fortunately, most (80–85 per cent) of these tumours are benign and, of these, 60–70 per cent are pleomorphic adenomas 1 . Surgical treatment is considered the cornerstone management of such lesions 2 . The first parotid tumour resection was reported by Bernard in 1823 and since then many surgical approaches have been described, from simple enucleation to partial or even total parotidectomy 3 .\n\nParotidectomy carries a risk of unique complications such as temporary neuropraxia or paralysis of the facial nerve, great auricular nerve injury, Frey’s syndrome (gustatory sweating), sialocele, salivary fistula, seroma, haematoma, or first bite syndrome. On the other hand, a defect at the parotidectomy site may develop, resulting in facial deformity 2 , 4 . Among these complications, aesthetic facial deformity and Frey’s syndrome may result in severe embarrassment for the patients with reduction of their self-esteem 5 .\n\nMany studies have documented that using graft interposition at the parotidectomy defect site decreases the incidence of these complications, particularly Frey’s syndrome, and facial asymmetry compared with non-grafted patients. Many interposition grafting methods have been described including superficial musculoaponeurotic system (SMAS) flap, dermal fat grafts (DFG), free fat grafts, sternocleidomastoid (SCM) flap, temporoparietal fascial flap, platysma flap, autologous tissue flaps with microvascular repair, and allografts like AlloDerm ® (LifeCell Corp., Branchburg, NJ, USA). Other studies have described the use of implantable synthetic alloplastic materials like silicone, polyethylene, polyacrylamide, or titanium elements 5–16 . Every method has its own pros and cons.\n\nFree dermal fat graft (FDFG) is a well-known technique for plastic surgical reconstruction of facial and complex head and neck defects 6 , 17 . Many authors have documented that autologous abdominal FDFG preserved facial cosmesis even with total parotidectomy and efficiently prevented Frey’s syndrome 2 , 5 , 6 , 18 , 19 . Many other authors have documented a valuable role of using SMAS flap in preventing post-parotidectomy complications and improving aesthetic results 3 , 4 , 20 . Further authors have combined both techniques by enveloping the FDFG by SMAS flap coverage 21 , 22 .\n\nThe aim of the current study was to compare the functional and aesthetic outcomes of using FDFG and SMAS flap after superficial parotidectomy.\n\nMethods\n\nPreoperative work\n\nDuring the period from February 2016 to October 2021, a prospective, randomized study was performed in patients undergoing superficial conservative parotidectomy for various benign indications. The study was carried out in a single centre after approval from the hospital ethical committees (No: 7/2022SURG3B) and in accordance with the Code of Ethics of the World Medical Association. The study has been reported in line with CONSORT guidelines 23 . The CONSORT checklist is available as Supplementary material . A detailed history was taken from all patients in conjunction with complete clinical examination and laboratory and radiological investigations. Informed consent was obtained from all patients to be enrolled in the study with full explanation of the steps of the operation and the possible complications or postoperative sequelae. All patients had fine-needle aspiration cytology to select patients with histologically benign parotid lesions. The included patients were randomized using a closed envelope method into two equal groups. For the first group, immediate reconstruction of the parotidectomy site was performed using infra-umbilical FDFG, whereas SMAS flap was used for reconstruction in the other group.\n\nProcedure\n\nAs a general policy, all patients received a dose of prophylactic antibiotics 1 h before surgery. Deep venous thromboprophylaxis was performed by wearing an elastic stocking, early postoperative ambulation, and administration of low molecular weight heparin (40 units/12 h) for high-risk group patients. All surgeries were performed under general anaesthesia in the supine position. All patients underwent superficial conservative parotidectomy through either a modified Blair’s or a modified facelift incision. Incisions were drawn with a permanent marker just before anaesthesia in the standing position and were done using a number 15 blade, followed by reconstruction of the parotidectomy defect.\n\nFree dermal fat graft group\n\nThe resulting defect after the superficial parotidectomy was accurately measured by measuring the size and weight of the excised specimen to determine the size of the FDFG that would be taken from the lower abdomen. FDFG harvesting was performed through a low abdominal elliptical incision, resulting in a linear scar that would be hidden under the bikini line. Then the FDFG was harvested as a fusiform or ellipse-shaped specimen after in situ de-epithelialization using sharp dissection. Then the FDFG was tailored and trimmed to simulate the size and shape of the excised parotid specimen, taking into consideration being 20–25 per cent larger in size than the excised specimen to compensate for possible postoperative graft shrinkage or fat lipolysis. After good matching of the designed graft to the present defect, the FDFG was placed in an ideal direction with the dermis facing the surface of the skin and subcutaneous fat so that revascularization between these two surfaces could take place ( Fig. 1a,b ). Graft fixation was then performed using polyglactin 4/0 interrupted sutures along the graft periphery. After perfect fixation of the whole graft, a suction drain was inserted, and the skin was closed in the subcutaneous layer by interrupted sutures and the subcuticular cutaneous layer. The graft donor site was closed in two layers after inserting a suction drain. Finally, a firm but not tight dressing and elastic bandage was applied to the abdomen.\n\nSuperficial musculoaponeurotic system flap group\n\nExposure of the parotid gland entailed raising of the periauricular skin flap into layers, both above and below the SMAS, until the anterior border of the parotid gland was reached ( Fig. 2a ). The dissection was continued downwards to the neck by undermining the platysma and exposure of the external jugular vein and the greater auricular nerve. Branches of the greater auricular nerve to the ear lobe were preserved. The deeper plane was developed by incision of the posterior edge of the SMAS and dissection at the anatomical plane between the SMAS and the parotid fascia. The net result was creating two distinct flaps: skin and SMAS flaps. Then, standard superficial parotidectomy followed with preservation of the branches of the facial nerve. Afterwards, the SMAS flap was plicated, condensed, or folded to fill the defect created by parotid resection, then sutured to the perichondrium of the external auditory canal and to sternomastoid muscle ( Fig. 2b,c ). Then the incision was closed in two layers after insertion of a suction drain.\n\nPostoperative course and follow-up\n\nAll patients in both groups received anti-oedema, analgesic, antibiotic, and prophylactic neurotronic treatment and were discharged when the drain was removed. Patients were observed in the immediate postoperative period to detect any complication such as haemorrhage, infection, or rejection. Patients were followed up in outpatient clinics after 2 weeks, 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, and then annually. A minimum follow-up period was planned to be 6 months. The primary outcome was determined as the development of Frey’s syndrome. Diagnosis of Frey’s syndrome was assessed by both subjective and objective methods. Subjectively, the patients were asked about symptoms indicating development of Frey’s syndrome such as gustatory sweating and flushing at the parotid region. On the other hand, a starch iodine test was performed as an objective method for its diagnosis at 6 months after surgery. The secondary outcome was evaluation of the patient’s own aesthetic satisfaction based on a scale of excellent, good, fair, and poor. Patients’ responses were recorded at each scheduled visit. At 6 months after surgery, patients’ satisfaction records were compared between the two groups. Within the same visit, evaluation regarding compensation of the parotidectomy defect was performed by an independent surgeon and recorded as optimum, over correction, or under correction. Responses were compared between the two groups.\n\nData collection\n\nDemographic data and any pre-existing co-morbidities were identified and recorded. Operative and pathological data regarding primary parotid pathology, defect size, operating time, length of hospital stay, and duration of drain placement were collected. Rates of operative or postoperative morbidities including facial nerve neuropraxia, seroma, haematoma, sialocele or the presence of immediate postoperative over or under correction were identified and recorded. Subjective patient aesthetic satisfaction and the detection of Frey’s syndrome using both subjective and objective methods were recorded. All collected data were compared between the two groups.\n\nStatistical analysis\n\nSample size was calculated using G*Power 3.1 software 24 and was based on Frey’s syndrome as the primary outcome. A two-tailed sample size was estimated to be 39 in each group (α=0.05 and sample power = 80 per cent). Data were analysed using SPSS ® (version 23.0; IBM, Armonk, NY, USA). The normality of distribution of variables was verified using Wilks–Shapiro test. The data are expressed as number, percentage, mean, and standard deviation (s.d.). A chi-square or Fisher's exact test was used to compare qualitative variables. Student’s t -test was used for comparison of quantitative variables between two groups of normally distributed data, whereas Mann–Whitney’s test was used for comparison of quantitative variables between two groups of non-normally distributed data. A two-sided P value was set to be significant if < 0.050.\n\nResults\n\nThe study included 78 patients who were randomly divided into the two study groups with 39 patients in each group. There was no statistically significant difference when comparing the two groups regarding demographic data and preoperative co-morbidities ( Table 1 ), or the pathological criteria of the parotidectomy specimens ( Table 2 ). No patients were lost to follow-up ( Fig. 3 ).\n\nThe additional operating time for the harvest and shaping of FDFG in the first group and for dissection of SMAS in the second group was recorded and compared between the two groups. Although the mean(s.d.) time for FDFG (15.30(2.31) min) was significantly longer than the mean(s.d.) time taken for SMAS (12.94(2.36) min; P < 0.001), it did not affect the mean time for the whole complete procedure with no statistically significant difference between the two groups ( P = 0.076). The excised specimen mean weight and volume did not show a significant difference between the two groups ( P = 0.766 and 0.082 respectively) as shown in Table 3 . For the FDFG group, the harvested grafts were reshaped and tailored to fit within the resultant parotidectomy defect with a 20–25 per cent increase in volume, so the corresponding excised specimens had a mean(s.d.) weight of 37.87(8.07) g and a mean volume of 29.89(6.80) cm 3 .\n\nAs shown in Table 4 , there was no significant difference between the two groups regarding postoperative complications including transient facial nerve neurapraxia, superficial infection, sialocele, seroma formation, or Frey’s syndrome that was diagnosed by subjective and/or objective methods. Some added complications were recorded only in the FDFG group at the graft donor site, where mild infection occurred in two patients (5 per cent), and seroma occurred in three patients (8 per cent).\n\nSix months after surgery, an independent surgeon’s evaluation for the aesthetic compensation for the post-parotidectomy defect revealed that over correction with fullness of the parotid region was observed only in the FDFG group (six patients, 15 per cent), whereas under correction was observed only in the SMAS group (seven patients, 18 per cent). Comparison between the two groups showed statistically significant differences between the groups for over correction ( P = 0.025) and under correction ( P = 0.012).\n\nBoth groups had comparable results regarding patients’ aesthetic satisfaction at 6 months after surgery with no statistically significant difference between the two groups ( P = 0.890). More than 50 per cent of the patients in either group recorded an excellent response, whereas the remaining responses ranged from good to fair. No patients reported a poor aesthetic outcome in either group ( Fig. 4a , b and Table 5 ).\n\nDiscussion\n\nThe main findings of the current study are that there were no differences in the incidence of Frey’s syndrome or patients’ aesthetic satisfaction between the groups undergoing FDFG and SMAS flap.\n\nConcave facial asymmetry, preauricular deformity, and Frey’s syndrome are embarrassing and disturbing post-parotidectomy complications that cause low self-esteem and annoy patients 25 . Using interposition grafts significantly decreases these complications 6 . Allografts or synthetic alloplastic materials are available options that can be used. Although they have the advantage of no need for an additional surgical site, they are associated with an increased risk of infection, seroma, sialocele, salivary fistula, or longer drainage duration. Moreover, synthetic grafts are more expensive and are liable to implant extrusion 6 , 26–31 . On the other hand, autologous grafts provide an excellent option for reconstruction with minimal sequelae. Some autologous flaps have their own problems like SCM flap or temporoparietal fascial flap 6 . However, many studies have documented the superiority of using FDFG or SMAS flap and sometimes their combination over simple closure without flaps, with a lower rate of complications 2–6 , 8 , 11 , 12 , 15 , 17–22 , 25 , 26 , 32–37 . Most of these studies compared the results of FDFG and SMAS flap, but they were meta-analyses of multiple studies from different places and different surgical teams. Furthermore, these studies were comparing procedure with a control group where no graft was done. To the best of the authors' knowledge, the current study is one of the first studies that compares these two techniques at the same institution and by the same surgical team.\n\nIn the current study, the mean time taken for harvest and remoulding of FDFG was significantly longer than the time used for the development of SMAS flap. This could be attributed to the addition of another abdominal incision despite the required caution and time in raising the SMAS flap. The actual difference between the two groups was a few minutes, so when they were added to the actual parotidectomy time, there was no significant statistical difference between the two groups regarding the length of the total procedure. These results are compatible with those of Conger and Gourin 26 , who documented in their study that the free fat transfer added nearly 15 min to the original procedure, but they reported a significant increase in operating time in the fat transfer group compared with controls without addition of grafts.\n\nOne of the unique sequelae of FDFG is fat resorption, which may range from 10 to 50 per cent of its original volume 19 , 35 . This shrinkage was explained by Mackay et al . 38 using an experimental animal model by partial replacement of the graft adipose tissue by the host fibrous tissue. Nosan et al . 19 postulated different factors for graft resorption like excessive thickness of the graft, bad handling, and poor graft vascularity. As fat resorption is hard to predict, many authors advise performing 15–30 per cent over correction on graft design to compensate for the future size reduction. Others suggest that the inclusion of the dermis layer with the graft can help in revascularization and decrease the fat resorption 6 , 22 , 26 , 33 , 34 . Consequently, in the current study, a 20–25 per cent over correction was performed with coaptation of flap dermis with the subcutaneous fat. No more over correction was attempted as the already excised specimen included the parotid pathology, so was itself larger than the required normal parotid volume needed to fill the resultant defect and to be comparable to the normal unoperated side. The outcome was that over correction was present in only 15.4 per cent—this is compatible with Mianroodi et al . 6 , who used 20–30 per cent intentional preoperative over correction and documented 14 per cent postoperative over correction. Although some authors 5 , 6 , 18 report under correction after this procedure, this was not encountered in the current study. On the other hand, under correction was encountered in some patients with SMAS flap within the current study. Either under or over correction was trivial and observed within the immediate postoperative period. It was not recorded to affect the patients’ own aesthetic evaluation. Tunca et al . 35 and Curry et al . 22 concluded that SMAS flap plication may not be enough to compensate for large parotid defects. Moreover, tight or excessive plication may result in facial asymmetry. Additionally, it was reported by Ogino et al . 39 that it was hard for surgeons to be able to elevate the SMAS flap with negative free tumour margins. Believing in this concept, the current study was designed to only include benign conditions and for superficial parotidectomy.\n\nThe results of the present study revealed that postoperative complications such as seroma and sialocele had a lower incidence rate in the FDFG group than in the SMAS group. This could be attributed to better filling of the parotidectomy defect with less dead space left. In the other group, however, there was a two-layer dissection both above and below the SMAS that could theoretically increase the incidence of seroma in this group. However, this difference did not reach statistical significance. Both seroma and sialocele were transient and responded to aspiration and medical treatment. On the other hand, rates of infection were slightly more common in the FDFG group. This could be explained by a higher incidence of fat necrosis and subsequent infection. However, the difference between the two groups did not reach a statistically significant value. Adding to these, other encountered complications such as transient facial nerve neuropraxia and wound infection were compatible with the results of similar studies 4 , 21 , 22 , 36 .\n\nMany previous studies have documented that FDFG 2 , 5 , 6 , 8 , 14 , 15 , 18 , 25 , 26 , 33 , 35 , 36 , SMAS flap 3 , 4 , 8 , 11 , 20 , 22 , 32 , or using both together 21 , 22 has a statistically significant effect in lowering the incidence of Frey’s syndrome and increasing cosmetic and aesthetic satisfaction. The current study added that there was no statistically significant difference between FDFG and SMAS flap regarding these parameters. The majority of patients documented excellent satisfaction with their aesthetic results and the rest of the responses were either good or fair without any poor results. The results were slightly better after FDFG, but didn’t reach statistical significance.\n\nBoth FDFG and SMAS flap are simple, rapid, reliable procedures with the great advantage of being autologous. Both are efficient in improving both functional and aesthetic outcomes including a lower incidence of Frey’s syndrome. Either procedure could be applied in all patients with superficial parotidectomy according to the surgeon’s experience and preference, taking into consideration that SMAS flap should be reserved for patients where small defects are expected.",
