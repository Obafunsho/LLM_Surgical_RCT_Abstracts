As individuals age, the risk of postoperative complications, including postoperative delirium, increases due to age-related physiological decline [ 4 – 7 ]. Postoperative delirium, a common cognitive disturbance, is strongly associated with increased morbidity, mortality, and healthcare costs. Consequently, early identification of high-risk patients and anticipation of potential complications have become critical priorities in perioperative care.\n\nSarcopenia, a progressive and generalized skeletal muscle disorder characterized by loss of muscle mass and strength, is a major contributor to frailty in the elderly [ 8 ]. Its prevalence ranges from 5 to 13% in people aged 60 to 70 years, and increases to 11–50% in individuals aged 80 and above [ 9 ]. The European Working Group on Sarcopenia in Older People (EWGSOP), International Clinical Practice Guidelines for Sarcopenia (ICFSR), Foundation for the National Institutes of Health (FNIH), and Asian Working Group on Sarcopenia (AWGS) have recommended flexible methods for muscle assessment with precise cut-off values [ 10 – 13 ]. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT) are considered gold standards for noninvasive quantification of muscle mass [ 14 , 15 ], while dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) and bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) also provide quantitative muscle mass evaluation. Muscle strength and physical performance are supposed to be measured by grip strength, chair stand test, and gait speed. These assessment tools are practical and easily applicable in clinical settings. Due to its high prevalence and objectivity, sarcopenia may serve as a useful predictor of surgical prognosis.\n\nCurrent studies exploring the association between sarcopenia and postoperative outcomes vary in their definitions and measurements of sarcopenia, leading to methodological heterogeneity and inconsistent findings. Most previous meta-analyses have focused on specific surgical types or complications [ 16 – 18 ]. Few have comprehensively addressed postoperative delirium and recovery in elderly patients [ 19 ]. Therefore, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to examine the association between sarcopenia and postoperative delirium, other complications, and recovery outcomes in elderly surgical patients.\n\nMethods\n\nThis systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted following the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) statement [ 20 ]. The study protocol was registered in PROSPERO (CRD42023424696, 18 May 2023).\n\nEligibility criteria\n\nWe included both prospective and retrospective studies evaluating the association between preoperative sarcopenia and postoperative complications in elderly surgical patients. Elderly patients were defined as individuals aged 60 years or older [ 21 ]. Studies of patients with a mean or median age over 60 undergoing elective or ambulatory surgeries were included. Sarcopenia had to be diagnosed using validated criteria based on muscle strength and muscle quality assessment, with established cut-off values [ 10 , 22 ]. Studies that defined sarcopenia based on quantiles of measured muscle mass was also included. Comparisons were required between sarcopenic and nonsarcopenic groups. Randomized controlled trials, quasi-experimental studies (nonrandomized controlled trials), and observational studies were eligible. Case reports/series, animal studies, and nonoriginal studies were excluded. No language restrictions were applied. When multiple studies reported on the same or overlapping cohorts, the one with the largest population was included.\n\nSearch strategy\n\nA comprehensive search strategy was developed for Ovid MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL (EBSCO), and Cochrane CENTRAL, covering literatures published from 1 January 2010 to 20 June 2023 (see Supplementary Table 1 in Appendix 1). This time frame was chosen due to the lack of a standardized definition of sarcopenia prior to 2010 [ 22 ]. ClinicalTrials.gov and the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) were also searched for ongoing trials.\n\nSelection process\n\nIdentified publications were imported into Endnote 21.2 software (Thomson Reuters, Toronto, Ontario, Canada). After deduplicate removal, two reviewers (YF, RS) independently screened titles and abstracts of the identified publications in the first-step screening, followed by full-text reviews of potentially eligible studies. Disagreements in the two-step screening were solved by discussion with additional reviewers. Excluded studies were noted in the PRISMA flow diagram.\n\nData collection and risk-of-bias assessment\n\nApplying a predefined data collection form, two reviewers (YF, RS) independently extracted data and verified the results. Extracted data included sarcopenia assessment methods, surgical types, and the number of sarcopenic and nonsarcopenic patients. The primary outcome was the incidence of postoperative delirium. Secondary outcomes included short-term mortality (≤ 90 days) and long-term mortality (beyond 6 months), all postoperative complications, pneumonia, infections, postoperative pancreatic fistula (POPF, defined according to the International Study Group on Pancreatic Fistula criteria) [ 23 ], anastomotic leakage (defined as radiologically or clinically verified leakage at surgical anastomosis site), length of hospital stay (LOS), readmission, overall survival, disease-free survival/recurrence-free survival (DFS/RFS), and recurrence. Postoperative complications classified by Clavien-Dindo complication grading score [ 24 ] were also extracted. Conflicts in data extraction were resolved through discussion or consultation.\n\nTwo reviewers (YF, RS) independently applied the Quality in Prognosis Studies (QUIPS) tool [ 25 ] for risk-of-bias assessment. Domains included risk related to participation, attrition, prognostic factor measurement, outcome measurement, confounding, and statistical analysis/reporting. Ratings were categorized as low, moderate, or high risk. Disagreements were resolved by consulting a third reviewer (YZ).\n\nStatistical analysis\n\nFor dichotomous variables, odds ratios (ORs) or hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were extracted or calculated based on reported data. The inverse variance method was used for meta-analysis. A random effects model was applied if the heterogeneity was high ( I 2 ≥ 50%), otherwise a common effect model was applied. For continuous variables, means and standard deviations were extracted. Estimated mean and standard deviation were calculated according to the reported median and quartiles in the eligible studies [ 26 , 27 ]. The skewness of the data was checked and the skewed data was excluded from the final synthesis [ 28 ]. The reported outcome estimates and 95% CIs of multivariable regressions in eligible studies were also synthesized.\n\nSubgroup analyses were conducted based on surgery type: head and neck surgery, heart and chest surgery, abdominal surgery, bone and joint surgery, and other surgery. Data analyses were conducted in R (version 4.3.2, R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria, 2023, https://www.R-project.org/ ) with “meta” package [ 29 ]. A P value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.\n\nResults\n\nSearch and screening\n\nUsing the defined search strategy outlined in Supplementary Table 1 (Appendix 1), the electronic search was conducted in June 2023. A total of 10,981 records were identified, and 1946 duplicates were removed (Fig. 1 ). After screening 9035 titles and abstracts, 517 full-text articles were assessed for eligibility. Ultimately, 265 studies were included in the qualitative synthesis (Supplementary Table 2, Appendix 1), and 242 studies were included in the final meta-analysis.\n\nCharacteristics of included studies\n\nThe included studies, published between 2012 and 2023 [ 30 , 31 ], involved patients undergoing various types of surgical procedures, with sample sizes ranging from 19 to 90,438 [ 32 , 33 ]. The majority were retrospective cohort studies, with a few being prospective or bidirectional in design [ 34 – 36 ]. Sarcopenia was most commonly diagnosed based on muscle mass indices quantified by CT imaging. Other modalities employed for muscle mass assessment included BIA, DXA, and MRI [ 37 – 39 ]. Various muscle mass indices were utilized across studies. Most adopted cutoff values established in previous researches, whereas some defined sarcopenia using the lowest tertile or quartile values within their populations.\n\nRisk-of-bias assessment\n\nRisk-of-bias assessments are summarized in Fig. 2 . The primary sources of bias identified were attrition and confounding. Many studies excluded patients lacking preoperative CT scans and did not report the characteristics of these excluded individuals, potentially introducing attrition bias. Furthermore, nearly half of the studies did not adjust for critical confounding variables, resulting in a moderate to high risk of bias due to confounding. Several studies had small sample sizes and insufficient recruitment of eligible participants, leading to participation bias. A few studies also exhibited bias related to the measurement of prognostic variables or issues with statistical analysis and reporting. No significant concerns were identified regarding outcome measurement.\n\nPostoperative delirium\n\nTable 1 presents the results of the meta-analysis for the primary and secondary outcomes from univariable analyses. Among the included studies, seven retrospective studies reported on postoperative delirium in surgical patients. Only one study explicitly reported the diagnostic method (the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders) for postoperative delirium [ 40 ]. Pooled analysis indicated a significant increase in the incidence of postoperative delirium among elderly patients with sarcopenia (OR 1.81, 95% CI 1.31 to 2.50, P < 0.001, I 2 24.0%). Corresponding forest plot and funnel plot are available in Supplementary Figs. 1 and 16, respectively (see Appendix 1). Multivariable analyses from two eligible studies [ 40 , 41 ] adjusting age, comorbidity, preoperative functional impairment, and cognitive impairment demonstrated that elderly patients with sarcopenia have a significantly higher risk of postoperative delirium (OR 2.42, 95% CI 1.27 to 4.59, P = 0.007, I 2 0.0%, Table 2 ).\n\nOther postoperative complications\n\nThe pooled results of univariable analyses for postoperative complications are summarized in Table 1 . Short-term mortality, reported in 61 studies involving 18,698 patients, was significantly higher in sarcopenic patients compared to nonsarcopenic patients (OR 2.61, 95% CI 1.97 to 3.44, P < 0.001, I 2 52.5%). Additionally, 61 studies with 16,576 patients provided data on overall complications, revealing a significantly increased risk in sarcopenic elderly patients (OR 1.79, 95% CI 1.53 to 2.09, P < 0.001, I 2 81.4%). Sarcopenic patients also demonstrated higher risks of postoperative complications classified as Clavien-Dindo grade II and higher (OR 1.80, 95% CI 1.51 to 2.16, P < 0.001, I 2 55.8%), and grade III and higher (OR 1.65, 95% CI 1.42 to 1.93, P < 0.001, I 2 68.4%). Elderly patients with sarcopenia were more prone to postoperative pneumonia (OR 2.38, 95% CI 1.99 to 2.85, P < 0.001, I 2 48.1%) and infections (OR 1.66, 95% CI 1.29 to 2.14, P < 0.001, I 2 66.6%). Among patients undergoing digestive tract surgeries, higher incidence of anastomotic leakage was observed in sarcopenic individuals (OR 1.47, 95% CI 1.20 to 1.80, P < 0.001, I 2 37.1%). However, no significant difference was found for POPF (OR 0.97, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.27, P = 0.827, I 2 50.0%) among patients undergoing pancreatic or peri-pancreatic surgeries. Forest plots for these analyses are presented in Supplementary Fig. 2–9, and funnel plots in Supplementary Fig. 16 (Appendix 1).\n\nResults from multivariable analyses are presented in Table 2 . Confounding variables, such as age, sex, body mass index, comorbidities, American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) grade, disease stage, and surgery type were accounted for. Elderly patients with sarcopenia demonstrated significantly higher risks of short-term mortality (OR 2.12, 95% CI 1.40 to 3.21, P < 0.001, I 2 88.4%), all complications (OR 2.18, 95% CI 1.63 to 2.90, P < 0.001, I 2 82.6%), Clavien-Dindo grade II and higher complications (OR 2.23, 95% CI 1.74 to 2.87, P < 0.001, I 2 0.0%), and Clavien-Dindo grade III and higher complications (OR 3.02, 95% CI 2.12 to 4.29, P < 0.001, I 2 80.8%).\n\nPostoperative recovery\n\nSignificant intergroup differences in postoperative recovery outcomes were observed in univariable analyses (Table 1 and Supplementary Table 3). LOS, based on 48 studies, with 10,592 participants, was significantly longer for elderly patients with sarcopenia (mean difference [MD] 1.99 days, 95% CI 1.33 to 2.65, P < 0.001, I 2 88.6%). Sarcopenic elderly patients also had a higher risk of readmission (OR 1.33, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.67, P = 0.016, I 2 58.6%). Long-term mortality and DFS/RFS were also significantly elevated for sarcopenic elderly patients. However, pooled analysis of seven studies assessing recurrence found no significant difference between sarcopenic and nonsarcopenic patients. The forest plots for the aforementioned analyses are provided in Appendix 1, Supplementary Fig. 10–15; the funnel plots can be found in Appendix 1, Supplementary Fig. 16.\n\nMultivariable analyses (Table 2 and Supplementary Table 4), adjusting covariates including age, sex, body mass index, comorbidities, ASA grade, disease stage, used therapy, preoperative nutritional status, and surgery type, confirmed the higher likelihood of readmission and long-term mortality in sarcopenic elderly patients. These individuals also showed significantly reduced overall survival and DFS/RFS. Only one eligible study [ 42 ] assessed recurrence in multivariable analysis, reporting a significantly higher recurrence risk in sarcopenic elderly patients.\n\nSubgroup analyses\n\nDue to the limited number of included studies, subgroup analysis for postoperative delirium was not conducted. Table 3 presents the results of subgroup analyses for short-term mortality. Among elderly surgical patients, no significant differences in short-term mortality were observed (interaction P = 0.093). Subgroup analyses for other postoperative clinical outcomes are detailed in Supplementary Table 5 (Appendix 1). No significant between-group differences were found in rates of overall complications, Clavien-Dindo grade II and higher complications, Clavien-Dindo grade III and higher complications, pneumonia, infections, LOS, or readmission rates. No significant differences were observed in long-term mortality across different types of surgeries. However, sarcopenic elderly patients experienced a greater increase in the risk for overall survival when undergoing head and neck or heart and chest surgeries, compared to those undergoing bone and joint or abdominal surgeries.\n\nDiscussion\n\nThis study provides an updated synthesis of evidence on the association between sarcopenia and postoperative delirium and recovery among elderly surgical patients. Our findings suggest that sarcopenia is a significant independent risk factor for adverse postoperative outcomes, including postoperative delirium.\n\nAs the patient population ages, clinicians and researchers are increasingly focused on comprehensive preoperative evaluations to improve outcomes. Previous studies indicate that the prevalence of postoperative delirium ranges from 11.1 to 45.6%, depending on the assessment tools used, surgical types, and sample sizes [ 43 ]. Given its substantial impact on recovery and prognosis, postoperative delirium serves as a crucial indicator of poor outcomes. Evidence suggests that up to 40% of postoperative delirium cases are preventable and that early recognition of risk factors can shorten its duration by 35% [ 44 ]. Therefore, identifying and addressing modifiable risk factors such as sarcopenia may help improve the prognosis of elderly surgical patients.\n\nSarcopenia, a skeletal muscle disorder characterized by reduced muscle mass and function, has recently been recognized as a formal disease under the International Classification of Diseases [ 45 ]. This recognition has fueled a growing number of researches exploring its clinical relevance. Although diagnostic criteria vary [ 10 , 11 , 13 ], all definitions emphasize the importance of assessing both muscle mass and quality. Our meta-analysis clearly demonstrated that sarcopenia, when identified using widely accessible and objective measures, is associated with increased risks of postoperative delirium, complications, delayed recovery, and mortality. In our syntheses of multivariable analyses, after adjusting for confounding variables, the combined effect sizes for postoperative delirium, complications, mortality, and recovery indices in elderly patients were higher than those in the univariable analyses, indicating that the prognostic value of sarcopenia remains robust even after adjusting for confounding variables. Across the included studies, multivariable models commonly adjusted for age, sex, ASA grade, body mass index (BMI), comorbidity indices, and nutritional parameters including serum albumin. However, there was considerable variability in the covariates used, and few studies accounted for frailty or cognitive status. Given the frequent co-occurrence of sarcopenia with frailty, malnutrition, and multimorbidity, there is a risk of collinearity among these predictors, which may complicate interpretation of their independent effects. These overlapping geriatric syndromes share common pathophysiological pathways and may influence postoperative outcomes through similar mechanisms. Future studies should consider using comprehensive geriatric assessments to evaluate and adjust for potential collinearity in predictive models.\n\nRecent evidence has also underscored the prognostic value of functional assessments such as handgrip strength in elderly surgical patients. It has been demonstrated that low handgrip strength is not only a surrogate marker for sarcopenia but also an independent predictor of prolonged LOS [ 46 ]. This highlights the value of incorporating functional measurements alongside structural muscle indices in perioperative assessments. A multimodal assessment approach may also improve the feasibility of screening programs in resource-limited settings.\n\nIn this review, however, the substantial heterogeneity in sarcopenia definitions across studies significantly affects the precision and interpretability of the pooled estimates. Variations exist in both the diagnostic criteria and measurement methods, including the use of CT, MRI, DXA, and BIA, as well as differing cutoff values based on population-specific references or statistical thresholds. Some studies include assessment of muscle strength and physical performance, while others rely solely on imaging-based indices. This inconsistency introduces clinical and statistical heterogeneity, complicating comparisons and synthesis. It is plausible that pooled estimates either overstate or understate the true associations due to these divergent definitions. Moreover, different definitions may reflect varying stages or severities of sarcopenia, further influencing outcome relationships. Standardizing diagnostic criteria in future research will be essential to reduce bias, enhance comparability, and strengthen the clinical applicability of findings.\n\nWhile studies employed various sarcopenia definitions and cutoffs, preventing subgroup analysis by diagnostic method, exploratory subgroup analysis by surgery type revealed a significantly increased risk of poor overall survival in elderly patients undergoing head and neck or heart and chest surgeries. This may reflect the greater physiological and functional demands associated with these procedures. Significant cardiopulmonary stress and prolonged bed rest of after certain surgeries may amplify the adverse impact of sarcopenia on postoperative recovery in these populations. Therefore, preoperative interventions targeting sarcopenia may warrant particular emphasis in patients undergoing head and neck or heart and chest surgeries. No significant differences were observed in other postoperative complications among the subgroups, reinforcing the need for consistent perioperative assessment and management strategies in sarcopenic elderly patients, regardless of surgery type. Future large-scale prospective studies are necessary to further elucidate the impact of sarcopenia across various patient populations and surgical contexts.\n\nCurrently, randomized controlled trials have investigated perioperative interventions targeting sarcopenia. Prehabilitation strategies, such as oral nutritional supplementation and physical exercise, have demonstrated effectiveness in improving sarcopenia and reducing postoperative complication rates in certain surgical populations [ 47 – 49 ]. However, other researches failed to find significant benefits [ 50 , 51 ]. Further trials are required to refine prehabilitation protocols and identify optimal therapies for managing sarcopenia in surgical settings.\n\nThis review has several limitations. Firstly, most included studies were retrospective and single-centered, introducing inherent biases. Secondly, most studies reporting postoperative delirium did not describe the assessment tools or diagnostic criteria used. This lack of methodological transparency reduces the comparability of results and may introduce bias due to potential heterogeneity in outcome definitions. Thirdly, some funnel plots in this review displayed notable asymmetry, suggesting the possibility of publication bias and substantial heterogeneity. Additionally, the heterogeneity remained high in subgroup analyses, likely due to differences in sarcopenia diagnostic criteria, patient characteristics, and study designs. These may limit the external validity of the pooled estimates. Furthermore, our inclusion criteria allowed studies with a mean or median age over 60, which may have resulted in the inclusion of younger individuals and potential confounding effects.\n\nThe findings of this review have important implications for clinical practice. Preoperative routine screening for sarcopenia in elderly patients undergoing surgery may allow for early identification of individuals at high risk of postoperative complications. The incorporation of sarcopenia evaluation into existing preoperative risk stratification frameworks has the potential to significantly improve the accuracy of perioperative risk prediction and facilitate the development of individualized care strategies, including targeted nutritional support, physical prehabilitation, and closer postoperative monitoring. Such measures may ultimately reduce complications, morbidity, improve recovery, and optimize long-term outcomes in this vulnerable population.\n\nConclusions\n\nSarcopenia is a significant independent risk factor for postoperative delirium and poor recovery in elderly patients. Further prospective, large-scale studies are required to standardize diagnostic criteria and evaluate perioperative management strategies for sarcopenic elderly patients.\n\nSupplementary Information\n\nSupplementary Material 1.",
