  "abstract": "Background: Compared to interscalene block (ISB), the superior trunk block (STB) lowers the incidence of hemidiaphragmatic paralysis (HDP) without compromising analgesic efficacy, making it a valuable alternative. However, the lack of consensus on the optimal local anesthetic (LA) dose for STB limits its standardized clinical application.

  "full_text": "Background\n\nShoulder arthroscopy is a frequently performed surgical procedure for various shoulder pathologies that typically results in severe postoperative pain, with intensity comparable to that of major surgeries like gastrectomy or thoracotomy [ 1 ]. The interscalene brachial plexus block (ISB) is reportedly the most effective method among the various modalities for the management of postoperative pain following shoulder arthroscopy [ 2 ]. However, ISB is significantly associated with hemidiaphragmatic paralysis (HDP), with reported incidence rates nearly by 100% in clinical study, which limits its clinical application in patients with compromised respiratory function [ 3 ]. The superior trunk block (STB) has emerged as a promising alternative to ISB, offering the potential advantage of reduced HDP incidence [ 4 ]. Clinical evidence demonstrates that STB provides both satisfactory surgical anesthesia and postoperative analgesia comparable to conventional approaches, while potentially reducing postoperative opioid consumption [ 1 , 5 ]. However, partial HDP persists at clinically significant rates, posing significant risks, particularly for patients with preexisting respiratory comorbidities [ 6 , 7 ].\n\nPreliminary evidence suggests that dose reduction of local anesthetics (LA) can be achieved through either decreasing the administered volume or reducing the drug concentration, may help mitigate the risk of HDP [ 8 ]. Despite this, no consensus has been established regarding the optimal volume of LA required for a successful STB while minimizing the likelihood of HDP, especially partial HDP.\n\nThis study was designed to systematically investigate and estimate the maximum effective volume of 0.25% ropivacaine needed to avoid HDP in 90% of patients undergoing shoulder arthroscopy with ultrasound-guided STB. To achieve this, we employed the Biased Coin Design (BCD), a method commonly used in dose-finding trials [ 9 – 19 ].\n\nMethods\n\nThis prospective study received ethical approval from the Institutional Review Board of Changzheng Hospital (Approval No. CZEC2022SL05) prior to commencement of patient recruitment. All enrolled participants provided written informed consent following comprehensive disclosure of the study protocol, including potential risks and anticipated benefits. The study was conducted in strict accordance with the ethical principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. The principal investigator was Dr. Li Yonghua. The recruitment of approximately 52 patients was planned between July 2022 and March 2024.\n\nWe enrolled adult patients (aged from 46 to 80 years) with American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status classification I-III scheduled for shoulder arthroscopy. The exclusion criteria were rigorously established as: (1) Comorbidities including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), prior cerebral infarction, diabetes mellitus, transient ischemic attack (TIA), or obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS); (2) Contraindications to nerve block procedures. During the pre-operative visit, investigators conducted an assessment of diaphragm function using a portable ultrasound device. Patients whose diaphragms could not be clearly visualized under ultrasound were excluded from the study to ensure the accurate measurement of diaphragm motion during the trial.\n\nDiaphragmatic excursion\n\nUnder B-mode ultrasonography, diaphragmatic excursion was quantified by first identifying the dome (peak point) through measurement of the maximal craniocaudal displacement from the screen apex. Following dome localization, M-mode imaging was activated to capture diaphragmatic kinetics during three consecutive maximal inspiratory efforts (Figs. 1 and 2 ). Participants were specifically instructed to perform forceful nasal inspiration while maintaining the sniffing position.\n\nDiaphragmatic excursion, defined as the distance (in centimeters) from the resting expiratory position to peak inspiratory elevation, was quantitatively assessed using M-mode ultrasonography. Measurements were obtained at baseline and 3 h post-block, with comparative analyses performed between these time points. At each predetermined time point, triplicate measurements were averaged for subsequent statistical analysis. Findings were categorized as none, partial, or complete HDP and defined as follows. “None” was operationally defined as variations ranging from 0 to 25% relative to baseline values. “Partial” referred to 25 − 75% decrease relative to baseline. “Complete” indicated a decrease greater than 75% from baseline or the presence of paradoxical movement. In this trial, a “failed block” was defined as any decrease in diaphragmatic movement exceeding 25% from baseline, meaning both partial and complete HDP were classified as failed blocks [ 6 , 7 , 20 , 21 ]. All M-mode tracings underwent independent analysis by two blinded anesthesiologists to verify measurement reliability and inter-rater consistency [ 6 , 22 , 23 ]. In cases where the two reviewers disagreed on the diagnosis of HDP, an independent blinded anesthesiologist reviewed the images to serve as a tiebreaker. It is important to note that even with the modified protocol introduced by Kim et al. [ 6 ], diaphragmatic movement may not always be clearly visualized under ultrasound in clinical practice.\n\nSuperior trunk block\n\nWe performed the STB technique as reported in our 2023 study [ 24 ]. This technique was modified from the procedures described by Kim et al. [ 6 ] and Kang et al. [ 7 ], with adjustments to align with our clinical practice. Accurate identification and precise localization of the superior trunk (ST) of the brachial plexus is the primary prerequisite for ensuring the success of the block. To achieve this, we developed a stepwise approach to ST localization after thoroughly reviewing the relevant literature [ 25 , 26 ]. A high-resolution linear array ultrasound transducer (frequency range: 5–15 MHz) was employed to optimize nerve structure visualization with patients positioned in the standardized supine position, neck fully exposed and slightly extended to optimize anatomical access. The ultrasound transducer was systematically maneuvered in a cephalad-to-caudad trajectory, initiating at the supraclavicular fossa and advancing along the interscalene groove, with repeated sweeps performed to definitively localize the ST. Through systematic transducer manipulation, sequential ultrasonographic identification of the C5 to C7 nerve roots was achieved, enabling comprehensive mapping of the brachial plexus anatomical continuum. The injection site was strategically localized immediately proximal to the suprascapular nerve origin, ensuring comprehensive anesthesia of the ST while preserving distal nerve integrity. After ensuring skin sterility and infiltrating the skin with 1 ml of 1% lidocaine, the needle was advanced along a strictly lateromedial trajectory utilizing the in-plane ultrasound guidance technique, maintaining continuous visualization of the entire shaft and tip throughout insertion. Upon confirming needle tip position immediately inferior to the ST, 50% of the predetermined LA volume was incrementally injected toward the neural target, under continuous ultrasound monitoring. Following first deposition, the needle tip was meticulously repositioned to a suprajacent position relative to the ST, where the residual LA solution was administered under continuous ultrasonographic surveillance. During controlled injection, the needle tip was incrementally repositioned to facilitate circumferential perineural LA distribution. The beveled needle tip was kept under continuous ultrasound visualization and oriented toward the trunk throughout the procedure.\n\nAnesthetic protocol\n\nNo preoperative sedation was administered before entering the operating room. Standard ASA monitoring was applied, including continuous pulse oximetry, electrocardiography, and non-invasive blood pressure monitoring on the contralateral upper extremity. General anesthesia was induced with intravenous propofol (1.5–2.0 mg/kg), rocuronium (0.6–0.8 mg/kg), and remifentanil (2 µg/kg). Anesthesia was maintained with sevoflurane (0.6-1.0 MAC) in an air-oxygen mixture, and a continuous infusion of remifentanil (0.01–0.1 µg/kg/min) was precisely regulated to maintain ≤ 20% variation from preoperative hemodynamic. All shoulder arthroscopic procedures were conducted with patients in the standardized lateral decubitus position under the direction of a dedicated surgical team comprising fellowship-trained shoulder specialists [ 27 ]. No supplemental analgesic medications were administered, and no LA were injected by the surgeons at the surgical sites.\n\nOutcome measurements\n\nThe primary outcome of this clinical trial was the occurrence of HDP following STB, assessed by comparing diaphragmatic motion at baseline with measurements taken 3 h post-block administration. The secondary outcome was the duration of STB, defined as the time interval from completion of LA injection to return of pain sensation at rest.\n\nData collection\n\nTwo independent investigators, rigorously masked to treatment allocation, collected all participant data under the direct supervision of the principal site investigators.Trained clinical research associates monitored the data collection process. Separately, anthropometric data (age, sex, weight, and height) were collected by another blinded anesthesiologist researcher.\n\nVolume allocation determined based on BCD\n\nVolume allocations was performed in a response-dependent manner, with failed blocks triggering a 2 mL downward adjustment in subsequent administrations. Following successful blocks, subsequent patients were randomized to receive either: (1) an incremental volume increase of 2 mL (probability b = 0.11), or (2) maintenance of the current volume (probability 1-b = 0.89) [ 9 – 19 ]. The minimum allowable volume was predetermined at 1mL; consequently, even after block failure at this threshold volume, subsequent patients still received 1mL. The trial design is illustrated in Fig. 3 . In this trial, we defined a “successful” block as one in which HDP was absent on M-mode ultrasonography. Conversely, if HDP was present, the block was considered “failed”.\n\nSample size estimation\n\nTo determine the minimum sample size required for MEV90 stabilization, we conducted simulation studies under varying scenarios of dose distribution, sample size and positive response counts, assuming a fixed-sample BCD design with a predefined minimum number of positive responses. The dose-escalation scenarios and initiation criteria were implemented following Durham et al. [ 28 ]. The initial simulation design demonstrated parameter estimate stabilization after a minimum of 40 experimental blocks, indicating convergence of the computational model. This finding is consistent with the works of Pace et al. [ 29 ] and George et al. [ 30 ], which demonstrated similar stabilization patterns. A secondary simulation design was implemented by incorporating the strict assumption that post-success volume escalation probability precisely matched the theoretical values (b = 0.11). To satisfy the requirement, the minimum number of successful responses was constrained to integer multiples of 9 throughout the simulation. Consistent with the initial findings, parameter estimates stabilized after 40 blocks in this secondary simulation; however, the standard errors (SEs) of these estimates were significantly reduced compared to the primary design. A fixed threshold of 45 positive responses (the minimal multiple exceeding the stabilization requirement of 40 blocks) was selected as the stopping criterion for our dose-finding study. Therefore, we consecutively enrolled patients undergoing shoulder arthroscopy and performed standard nerve block until 45 successful blocks were achieved, with their corresponding randomization envelopes (containing the assigned volume) opened. The final sample size was not predetermined but was estimated through simulation studies to be 52 ± 2.\n\nStatistical methods\n\nThe MEV90 was calculated using isotonic regression with a 95% CI derived by bootstrapping. Following the notation of Stylianou et al. [ 31 ], we used the dose estimator µ3, which is defined as the interpolated dose that has an estimated toxicity exactly equal to 0.9. Both this estimator and the estimator µ2 demonstrate lower variability than the classic isotonic estimator µ1. The statistical analyses were conducted using the R statistical software package V.4.3.2 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria. ISBN 3-900051-07-0, URL http://www.Rproject.org ).\n\nResults\n\nFrom July 2022 to March 2024, 52 patients were prospectively enrolled in this dose-response study to determine the MEV90 of 0.25% ropivacaine required for ultrasound-guided STB while preventing HDP. Patient characteristics are presented in Table 1 . Using the biased coin up-and-down design, the maximum effective volume was found to be 7.6 ml (95% CI, 6.5 to 8.5) in 90% of patients (Fig. 4 ). Sensory block duration with 0.25% ropivacaine were 19.0 h (15 mL, 1 case), 16.5 ± 0.5 h (13 mL, 2 cases), 13.33 ± 0.47 h (11 mL, 3 cases), 12.38 ± 1.47 h (9 mL, 16 cases), 8.97 ± 3.19 h (7 ml, 29 cases) and 6.0 h (5 ml, 1 case). (Table 2 )\n\nDiscussion\n\nISB is universally recognized regarded as the gold standard regional analgesic technique for shoulder surgery [ 2 , 3 ], but its near-100% incidence of HDP poses significant risks [ 32 ], particularly for patients with preexisting respiratory conditions [ 3 , 25 , 32 ]. From an anatomical perspective, ISB involves injecting LA into the interscalene groove at the cricoid cartilage level. This effectively blocks the C5 and C6 nerve roots, leading to complete anesthesia of the suprascapular nerve and axillary nerve. The anesthetic blockade covers the shoulder joint capsule, subacromial bursa, coracoclavicular ligament complex, and the corresponding cutaneous region overlying the shoulder joint [ 25 ]. However, the phrenic nerve courses longitudinally along the ventral aspect of the anterior scalene muscle [ 33 ]. Due to the close anatomical proximity, the LA can easily spread to the phrenic nerve. Additionally, it may ascend and affect the C4–C5 nerve roots, inevitably resulting in HDP [ 23 ]. Thus, given the diaphragm’s critical role as the primary inspiratory muscle contributing a significant fraction of tidal volume, preserving the phrenic nerve is paramount in high-risk populations [ 3 , 23 ].\n\nIn recent years, several clinical studies on modified ISB have been conducted, exploring methods such as reducing the dose of LA and injecting within the middle scalene muscle. However, none of these approaches have completely avoided phrenic nerve blockade [ 3 , 34 , 35 ]. Additionally, when performing an ISB utilizing the conventional lateral-to-medial needle approach, particular caution must be exercised to avoid iatrogenic injury the long thoracic nerve (C5-C7) and thoracodorsal nerve (C6-C8), as these neural structures consistently traverse the substance of the middle scalene muscle. Moreover, the injection site is closer to the nerve roots, so there exists potential for cephalad into the epidural space, particularly with larger injection volumes [ 36 , 37 ].\n\nCurrently accepted regional anesthesia alternatives comprise suprascapular nerve block (SSNB) with or without combined axillary nerve block, supraclavicular brachial plexus block (SCB), infraclavicular brachial plexus block (ICB), costoclavicular brachial plexus block (CCB), high-thoracic erector spinae plane block (HT-ESPB) and Serratus Superior Posterior Intercostal Plane Block (SSPIPB) [ 25 , 38 , 39 ].\n\nWhile SCB, ICB, and CCB each provide distinct anatomical approaches to brachial plexus anesthesia and demonstrate comparable postoperative analgesic efficacy compared with ISB, their requirement for larger LA volumes significantly increases the incidence of HDP [ 3 , 40 – 43 ]. Clinical evidence suggested ICB and CCB may exhibit incomplete blockade in some cases, occasionally result in potentially necessitating supplemental other nerve block in complex shoulder surgery [ 3 ].\n\nAmong alternative regional anesthesia techniques, emerging evidence for HT-ESPB supports its efficacy as a phrenic nerve sparing alternative to ISB for shoulder surgery. However, its analgesic efficacy is significantly inferior to ISB. Shoulder surgical procedures demonstrate HT-ESPB significantly increased intraoperative opioid requirements and postoperative analgesia demands when compared with ISB [ 38 , 44 ]. Furthermore, as a fascial plane block technique, while it can achieve a certain level analgesic effect, most experts believe its analgesic density remains more limited compare to peripheral nerve block or plexus block [ 45 ].\n\nSimilar to HT-ESPB, SSPIPB has emerged as another novel regional anesthesia technique for shoulder surgery. While traditionally used for analgesia in thoracic procedures such as video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) and breast surgery, Tulgar et al.‘s 2023 case report suggested its potential for postoperative analgesia in shoulder surgery [ 39 ]. Notably, the report included only three shoulder surgery cases with inconsistent outcomes, likely due to insufficient drug volume to adequately diffuse to relevant brachial plexus innervation areas. As a novel phrenic-sparing regional anesthesia approach for shoulder procedures, SSPIPB, like HT-ESPB, warrants additional clinical validation through large-scale investigations.\n\nSSNB has long attracted attention due to the anatomical distance between its target injection site and the phrenic nerve pathway. Based on the injection location, SSNB can be divided into posterior and anterior approaches. The posterior SSNB can completely avoid HDP, but it fails to block other nerves innervating the shoulder, thus providing insufficient surgical anesthesia. Its analgesic effect is significantly inferior to that of ISB [ 46 ]. Furthermore, anatomical variations may make it challenging to locate the suprascapular nerve at the suprascapular notch using ultrasound, limiting the widespread adoption of the posterior SSNB approach [ 46 ]. The anterior SSNB provides better analgesia but still cannot achieve surgical anesthesia due to its inability to block other nerves supplying the shoulder [ 25 ]. However, directly injecting LA around the superior trunk of the brachial plexus appears to yield higher blocking efficiency. Anatomical evidence suggests that the improved analgesic effect of the anterior SSNB is partly due to the medial spread of LA to the level of ST of the brachial plexus [ 47 , 48 ].\n\nA cadaveric study by José et al. [ 49 ] on STB found that a small dose (5 mL) of dye was sufficient to fully stain ST, while the middle trunk, inferior trunk, and phrenic nerve remained unstained. The anatomical basis for its reduced risk of HDP stems from progressive 3-mm lateral separation between phrenic nerve and brachial plexus that occurs with each 1-cm caudal progression from the cricoid cartilage. This spatial relationship explains why STB is associated with a significantly lower incidence of HDP in clinical practice [ 4 ]. Therefore, directly injecting LA at the level of ST can achieve effective analgesia with a lower drug dose.\n\nSince the first description of STB, substantial research has been conducted on its anatomical basis and mechanisms. Clinical randomized controlled trials have demonstrated that STB provides non-inferior analgesia compared to ISB, while significantly reducing the risk of HDP [ 6 , 7 ]. Administration of 15 mL 0.5% bupivacaine via dual-depot injection (10 mL deep, 5 mL superficial) at ST of the brachial plexus resulted in a 4.8% incidence of complete HDP [ 6 ]. Conversely, a single superficial injection of 15 mL 0.5% ropivacaine at the same site yielded 5.3% complete HDP with 71.1% partial diaphragmatic paralysis [ 7 ]. Our registered clinical trial (ChiCTR2000036608) established that 10 mL 0.25% ropivacaine provided effective surgical anesthesia while achieving 0% complete HDP and 31.8% partial paralysis. Given the established anesthetic efficacy at 0.25% concentration, defining the optimal volume to eliminate partial diaphragmatic paralysis represents a critical research priority. Our study demonstrates that STB with 0.25% ropivacaine at volumes ≤ 7.6 mL offers an effective diaphragm-sparing alternative, reducing HDP incidence to ≤ 10%. This volume threshold proves particularly advantageous for high-risk respiratory patients undergoing ambulatory shoulder arthroscopy, offering optimal pulmonary function preservation. Moreover, LA volume showed positive correlation with postoperative analgesia duration, suggesting dose-dependent prolongation of pain relief.[ 50 ]\n\nImportant limitations should be acknowledged in this study. First, the necessity for standardized general anesthesia following STB across all cases implemented due to inconsistent surgical anesthesia adequacy with varying LA volumes fundamentally limited our ability to precisely quantify diaphragmatic excursion. While this protocol ensured uniform surgical conditions, it required that all 3-hour post-block diaphragmatic assessments be conducted pre-induction to minimize measurement bias, consequently reducing the observable duration of regional analgesia. These methodological constraints preclude definitive conclusions about the dose-response relationship between LA volume and either block duration or analgesic efficacy in STB. Second, pragmatic considerations during trial design led to the exclusion of serial diaphragmatic motion recovery time measurements. The substantial resource requirements and potential patient burden associated with repeated assessments rendered this data collection impractical. This represents another recognized limitation of our study design.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn conclusion, this study determined the MEV90 of 0.25% ropivacaine for ultrasound-guided superior trunk block to prevent hemidiaphragmatic paralysis as 7.6 mL.\n\nSupplementary Information\n\nSupplementary Material 1.\n\nSupplementary Material 2.\n\nSupplementary Material 3.",
