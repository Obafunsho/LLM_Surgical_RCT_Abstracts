  "title": "Effect of dynamic lung compliance-guided positive end-expiratory pressure on postoperative pulmonary complications following thoracoscopic lobectomy: a randomized controlled trial",
  "abstract": "Background: The risk of postoperative pulmonary complications is significantly increased in patients undergoing video-assisted thoracic surgical lobectomy. Individualized positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) is extensively employed to optimize respiratory mechanics and enhance oxygenation during one-lung ventilation (OLV). However, there is no consensus regarding the optimal level of positive end-expiratory pressure and its effects during OLV. Therefore, we designed a randomized controlled trial to assess whether titrating PEEP to the maximum dynamic lung compliance in patients undergoing lung resection surgery impacts the occurrence of postoperative pulmonary complications (PPCs).\n\nMethods: In this randomized controlled trial, patients undergoing thoracoscopic lobectomy were randomly assigned to either a dynamic lung compliance group that received individualized PEEP guided by the maximum dynamic pulmonary compliance or a conventional ventilation group with a fixed PEEP of 5 cm H 2 O. The primary outcome was a composite of PPCs occurring within seven days, as defined by the European Perioperative Clinical Outcome criteria. Secondary outcomes included PEEP, Cdyn, PaO 2 , serum concentrations of IL-6 and TNF-α, and the duration of postoperative hospital stays.\n\nResults: One hundred patients were enrolled. The optimal PEEP obtained in the dynamic lung compliance group was 9.04 ± 1.83 cm H 2 O. Patients in the conventional ventilation group experienced 38% postoperative pulmonary complications versus 20% in the dynamic lung compliance group compared with the control group ( P < 0.01). The serum Interleukin-10 concentrations at T 5 in the dynamic lung compliance group were higher than those in the ventilation group ( P = 0.046), and the serum Interleukin-1 concentrations at T 5 and T 6 in the dynamic lung compliance group were lower than those in the ventilation group ( P < 0.01).\n\nConclusions: In patients undergoing video-assisted thoracoscopic lobectomy for lung resection with maximum dynamic compliance-guided positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP), the incidence of postoperative pulmonary complications (PPCs) within 7 days was significantly lower compared to those receiving a PEEP of 5 cm H 2 O.\n\nTrial registration: This study was registered at the Chinese Clinical Trials Registry on 04/07/2021 with registration number ChiCTR2100048201.\n\nSupplementary Information: The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s12871-025-03183-y.",

One-lung ventilation (OLV) achieves pulmonary isolation and facilitates optimal surgical visualization for physicians. However, this non-physiological ventilation approach may induce concomitant pathophysiological alterations, including elevated airway pressure, disturbances in ventilation/perfusion matching, and hypoxemia [ 7 , 8 ]. Patients undergoing video-assisted thoracic surgical lobectomy are confronted with a significantly heightened risk of PPCs [ 7 , 9 – 11 ]. The incidence of PPCs subsequent to thoracoscopic lobectomy can vary from 10.7–50.0% [ 10 ]. The application of PEEP has been demonstrated to enhance lung compliance, mitigate alveolar collapse, and optimize gas exchange [ 7 , 11 – 13 ].\n\nThere is accumulating evidence in favor of 5 cmH 2 O PEEP due to its benefits in correcting the ventilation-perfusion imbalance caused by one-lung ventilation [ 14 – 19 ] and reducing the incidence of PPCs [ 20 ]. However, other studies suggest that a fixed PEEP value may not be suitable for all patients, as individual characteristics such as BMI, chest wall dimensions and shape, lung weights, and pleural pressures cause significant variability in PEEP requirements [ 21 – 25 ]. If the PEEP value is too low, complete reopening of collapsed alveoli may not be achieved [ 26 ]. Conversely, excessively high levels of PEEP can result in complications such as intraoperative circulatory depression and promote hyperinflation [ 27 ]. Therefore, individualized PEEP has been proposed as an optimal solution to prevent intraoperative lung collapse based on inter-individual variability of the respiratory system compliance [ 12 ]. Individualized PEEP may potentially prevent alveolar collapse in the dependent lung in the lateral posture, increase the residual volume, improve the ventilation/perfusion ratio, and reduce the shear damage caused by periodic opening and closing of the alveolar [ 13 ].\n\nThe optimal PEEP for an individual patient can be fine-tuned through various methodologies, including conductance imaging, transpulmonary pressure assessment, and respiratory compliance evaluation [ 14 , 15 ]. Among these techniques, only the measurement of respiratory compliance can be performed without supplementary equipment. In the absence of airflow, static compliance provides a precise representation of how changes in PEEP influence the elastic properties of the respiratory system. Nevertheless, routine measurement of static compliance is often impractical in clinical settings. Consequently, dynamic compliance has emerged as a feasible alternative for determining the ideal PEEP [ 16 ]. Optimal PEEP titration determined by lung dynamic compliance (Cdyn) has been used in clinical practice and has been shown to reduce PPCs in patients undergoing abdominal surgery [ 17 ]. However, the efficacy of personalized PEEP guided by Cdyn in reducing the occurrence of PPCs in thoracic surgery remains inconclusive. Therefore, we conducted a single-center, randomized controlled trial to explore whether a strategy of PEEP titrated to the maximum Cdyn during OLV could reduce the incidence of PPCs during the initial seven postoperative days in patients undergoing video-assisted thoracoscopic lobectomy.\n\nMethods\n\nMaterials and methods\n\nThis is a single-center, randomized controlled clinical trial that has been approved by the Ethics Committee and registered. Written informed consent was obtained from each patient or legal representative before randomization. The trial was conducted between October 2022 and October 2023. Patients who were scheduled for elective pulmonary lobectomy and underwent video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) were assessed. Trial reporting complied with the CONsolidated Standards of Reporting Trials guidelines.\n\nThe patients\n\nThis article adheres to the consolidated standards of reporting trials (CONSORT) guidelines. Adult inpatients scheduled to undergo lung resection surgery were eligible. Recruitment was conducted by the site investigator on the day of admission. Subjects with one or more of the following conditions were excluded: (1) American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status IV or greater; (2) congestive heart failure (New York Heart Association classification III or greater); (3) planned transfer to intensive care unit after surgery; (3) lung bullae; (4) chronic obstructive pulmonary disease requiring oxygen; (5) The body mass index > 28 kg/m 2 ; (5) Thoracic surgery history; (6) With contraindications to PEEP use, such as high intracranial pressure, hypovolemic shock, and right heart failure. The surgical procedures were consistently performed by the same team of surgeons. A total of 126 patients were assessed for eligibility. Of these, 10 declined to participate, and 16 were excluded due to specific reasons: 5 patients had a body mass index (BMI) greater than 28, 5 had a history of previous pulmonary surgery, 3 were scheduled for postoperative ICU transfer, and 3 had diagnosed pulmonary bullae. Consequently, 100 patients were randomized into the study groups. The flow diagram of participant recruitment shows in Fig. 1 .\n\nRandomization, concealment, and blinding\n\nThe randomization sequence was generated using SPSS 23.0 for Windows (IBM Corporation, Armonk, NY, USA) by an independent staff member. Concealment was achieved through the use of sealed, opaque envelopes. In this study, only the anesthesiology team was aware of group assignments in order to implement the individualized or fixed PEEP strategies appropriately. Patients, data managers, and statistical analysts were blinded to group allocation throughout the study period. Outcome assessments were based on objective clinical and radiological criteria.\n\nStandard procedure\n\nThe routine intraoperative monitoring comprised of SpO 2 , electrocardiogram, blood pressure, nasopharyngeal temperature, muscle relaxant monitoring and cardiac output. Under local anesthesia, the radial artery on the non-operative side was cannulated and connected to the FloTrac/Vigileo system (Edwards Lifesciences, USA) for continuous cardiac output monitoring. Patients received anesthesia induction using sufentanil 0.5 µg/kg), propofol 0.3 mg/kg, Rocuronium 1.0 mg/kg), a double-lumen endotracheal tube was placed under the guide of the fibreoptic bronchoscopic positioning. Anesthesia was maintained with propofol, remifentanil, and rocuronium until the end of surgery. The sedline score, monitored using Masimo Sedline Cerebral Function Monitor, was maintained within the range of 25–50 to ensure an appropriate depth of sedation. During the intraoperative period, a restrictive fluid management strategy was employed to minimize the risk of pulmonary complications.\n\nDynamic compliance Titration\n\nThe patients were ventilated in a volume-controlled ventilation mode with the following parameters: inspiratory-to-expiratory ratio of 1:2, 20% inspiratory pause, and oxygen flow of 2 L/min. The fraction of inspired oxygen for two-lung ventilation (TLV) was 100%, and tidal volume (VT) during TLV was set to 8 ml/kg of predicted body weight (male 50 + 0.91 × [height (cm)– 152.4], female 45.5 + 0.91 × [height (cm)– 152.4]). When OLV began, the Fraction of inspired oxygen was initially set to 60%. During OLV, the VT was set to 6 ml/kg of predicted body weight, and the respiratory rate was titrated to achieve an end-tidal carbon dioxide of 35 to 45 mmHg. The PEEP decrement trial was initiated after the alveolar recruitment maneuver [ 18 ]. Patients in Group A received optimal PEEP followed by PEEP decremental titration, which was adjusted in 2 cmH 2 O steps, starting from 15 cmH 2 O and decreasing every 2 min until dynamic compliance reached its highest value. A second recruitment maneuver was performed using the same protocol as the first recruitment maneuver. The individualized PEEP level was then established and maintained throughout the study period. In Group B, after the alveolar recruitment maneuver, a PEEP level of 5 cm H 2 O was set and maintained during the one-lung ventilation period (Fig. 2 ).\n\nDuring the process, if the blood pressure dropped more than 20% of its basic level or the MAP was < 60 mmHg, 6 mg ephedrine was promptly administered for intervention. If the SpO 2 < 90% during the trial and did not rise to ≥ 90% or fall further to < 88% within 3 min, the research process would be halted, and sequential FiO 2 100%, continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) in the non-ventilated lung, and resumption of two-lung ventilation if necessary.\n\nData collection\n\nHemodynamic data including heart rate (HR), mean arterial pressure (MAP), cardiac output(CO), and the arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO 2 ), the arterial partial pressure of oxygen (PaO 2 ) were collected at the following time points: 15 min after quiet rest in the operating room (T 0 ), 10 min after two-lung ventilation TLV (T 1 ), 30 min after one-lung ventilation OLV (T 2 ), 60 min after OLV (T 3 ) and at the end of OLV (T 4 ). Respiratory mechanics including PEEP, airway peak pressure (Ppeak), airway mean pressure (Pmean), Cdyn were recorded at T 0 , T 1 , T 2 , T 3, and T 4 . Blood samples were collected and centrifuged at 1000×g at 4 °C for 15 min at T 0 , 24 h after surgery (T 5 ), and 72 h after surgery(T 6 ). The supernatant was stored at −80 °C. Commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits were employed to analyze the levels of interleukin-1(IL-1β),interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-10(IL-10)and tumor necrosis factor-alpha TNF-α.\n\nPrimary and secondary outcomes\n\nThe primary outcome was the occurrence of pulmonary complications within the first seven postoperative days [ 19 ]. Secondary outcomes included PEEP, Cdyn, PaO 2 , serum concentrations of IL-1β,IL-6,IL-10 and TNF-α, and the length of postoperative hospital stays.\n\nSample size\n\nThe sample size was calculated based on the assumption that PPCs had an incidence of 20% in Group A and 40% in Group B, which was based on the results of the previous studies [ 20 ]. Using the PASS 20.0 software, with an alpha (α) level of 0.05 and a beta (β) level of 0.1, the minimum sample size for each group was calculated to be 83. Accounting for a dropout rate of 20%, a total of 100 patients were enrolled in the study.\n\nStatistical analysis\n\nThe SPSS 23.0 software package (IBM Corporation, Armonk, NY, USA) was used for statistical analysis. Categorical data were expressed as frequencies or percentages and analyzed using the chi-square (χ2) test or Fisher’s exact test. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was used to assess the normality of continuous variables. Normally distributed continuous variables were presented as the mean ± standard deviation (SD), and compared between groups using the independent samples t-test. For non-normally distributed quantitative variables, data were expressed as median (interquartile range [IQR]), and comparisons were made using the Mann-Whitney U test. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to compare different time points within groups. A p -value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.\n\nResults\n\nAmongst the 100 eligible patients and randomized to either the combined individualized PEEP ( n = 50) or the control ( n = 50)group. A total of 100 subjects were included in the final analysis (Fig. 1 ).\n\nPatient demographic data and intraoperative characteristics of the study population are summarized in Table 1 , and there were no significant differences between the two groups regarding age, gender, body mass index, ASA physical status, duration of surgery, duration of OLV, and intraoperative fluid administration ( P > 0.05).\n\nPrimary outcome\n\nPostoperative pulmonary complications\n\nDiagnostic criteria for postoperative PPC refer to the 2015 European Perioperative Clinical Outcomes (EPCO) definition of PPC. The primary outcome occurred in 10 (20.0%) patients in the individualized PEEP group, while 19 subjects (38.0%) in the control group (risk difference, − 18.0%; 95% confidence interval [CI], − 35.4% to − 0.6%; relative risk, 1.90; 95% CI, 0.98 to 3.67; P = 0.047; Fig. 3 ). Pulmonary complications included atelectasis in 5 patients (10.0%) in Group A and 10 patients (20.0%) in Group B ( P = 0.161), pneumonia in 1 patient (2.0%) in Group A and 3 patients (6.0%) in Group B ( P = 0.307), pneumothorax in 2 patients (4.0%) in Group A and 5 patients (10.0%) in Group B ( P = 0.240), pleural effusion in 7 patients (14.0%) in Group A and 9 patients (18.0%) in Group B ( P = 0.585), and respiratory failure in 2 patients (4.0%) in both groups ( P = 1.000).\n\nSecondary outcomes\n\nOptimal PEEP\n\nThe optimal PEEP obtained through decremental titration based on dynamic pulmonary compliance was 9.04 ± 1.83 cm H 2 O, significantly higher than the fixed value of 5 cm H 2 O ( p < 0.01) (Fig. 4 ).\n\nRespiratory mechanics\n\nThere were no statistically significant differences in respiratory parameters, including SpO 2 , Ppeak, Pplat, PaO 2 , and PaCO 2 , between the two groups at any time point ( P > 0.05). However, at T 2 and T 3 , driving pressure was significantly lower in the individualized group compared to the 5 cm H 2 O Group ( P < 0.05) (Fig. 4 ).\n\nHemodynamics\n\nThe hemodynamic parameters (MAP, HR, CO) and SpO 2 were statistically similar at T 0 -T 4 between the two groups ( P > 0.05, Fig. 5 ).\n\nInflammatory cytokines\n\nThe IL-1β levels in Group A were lower in comparison with those in Group B at T 5 ( P = 0.003) and T 6 ( P = 0.001). The IL-10 levels were lower in Group B with respect to Group A at T 6 ( P = 0.046). There were no statistically significant differences in IL-6 and TNF-α levels between the two groups (Table 2 ).\n\nDiscussion\n\nThe results from this trial demonstrated that for patients undergoing thoracoscopic lobectomy, titrating PEEP based on lung optimal compliance significantly reduced the incidence of PPCs within the first seven days after surgery compared to conventional PEEP methods. Additionally, individualized PEEP notably decreased serum inflammation, such as IL-1β and IL-10. From the perspective of the strategy of pulmonary protective ventilation, appropriate PEEP during OLV is essential for preventing PPCs. Titrating PEEP to individual optimal levels is well-supported by pathophysiological evidence and offers significant benefits [ 21 ]. Current methods for determining individual PEEP during OLV include dynamic pulmonary compliance, driving pressure, electrical impedance tomography, and transpulmonary pressure-directed PEEP titration procedures [ 22 – 26 ]. The dynamic pulmonary compliance (Cdyn) method stands out among these techniques due to its non-invasive and radiation-free characteristics, rendering it particularly noteworthy. This approach facilitates the exclusive determination of respiratory compliance without necessitating any additional equipment apart from the ventilator.\n\nUnder zero-flow conditions, static compliance is accurate in reflecting the consequences of PEEP changes on the elastic properties of the respiratory system. However, measuring static compliance requires holding the breath for a few seconds at the end of inspiration to allow gas redistribution in the distal lungs, which is not pragmatic for daily practice in our opinion. Dynamic compliance thus represents a viable alternative in titrating optimal PEEP [ 27 , 28 ].\n\nThe effects of different PEEP levels on oxygenation during OLV have been controversial because heterogeneity in lung pathology produces different responses to PEEP. Michelet et al. found that 5 and 10 cm H 2 O PEEP improved oxygenation to the same degree, but 15 cm H 2 O worsened oxygenation because over-distension can increase shunt by diverting pulmonary blood flow to nonaerated areas [ 29 – 31 ]. Valenza et al. suggested that different levels of PEEP had little effect on PaO 2 in patients with normal lung function before surgery [ 32 ]. Furthermore, recent studies have demonstrated that individualized PEEP is associated with better oxygenation [ 33 , 34 ]. Another study, which compared individualized PEEP under the guidance of minimal driving pressure with traditional lung protective ventilation, found no significant difference in oxygenation between groups during OLV [ 35 ].\n\nBased on our research, Cdyn-guided individualized PEEP was more effective in decreasing PPCs than a fixed PEEP of 5 cm H 2 O, consistent with previous studies [ 27 , 35 – 41 ]. Although the individualized PEEP group reduced the incidence of postoperative pulmonary complications in patients there was no significant difference in postoperative inter-oxygenation between the two groups, suggesting that there may be other mechanisms for this. It is plausible that the morphological manifestations of atelectasis may manifest later than physiological changes, such as PaO 2 levels. The personalized effect of PEEP-induced lung recruitment may only partially persist during the early extubation phase. In the absence of postoperative lung stabilization strategies, small airways tend to undergo closure during the early period after extubation, thereby compromising gas exchange in distal alveoli [ 41 ].\n\nConversely, a reduction in cytokine levels may also contribute to the mitigation of postoperative pulmonary complications. TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6 are cytokines involved in the inflammatory process of acute lung injury [ 42 ], exacerbating lung injury and making patients more susceptible to respiratory infections. Previous studies have demonstrated that OLV and surgical trauma are accompanied by the release of excess inflammatory cytokines, leading to pulmonary infections and systemic inflammation. The inflammatory marker IL-1β was utilized to indirectly assess the extent of pulmonary injury in this study, complemented by the analysis of other pro-inflammatory factors including IL-6, IL-10, and TNF-α. According to the results of our research, individualized PEEP seems to decrease biomarkers of systemic inflammation. This study showed that at 72 h after surgery, the measured values of IL-10 in Group A were higher than those in Group B, and the differences were significant ( P = 0.046). IL-1β in Group A was significantly lower than in Group B at T 5 and T 6 , suggesting that individualized PEEP could reduce the levels of postoperative inflammatory factors. The explanation may be that individualized PEEP could reduce pulmonary capillary shear injury and local ischemia-reperfusion injury and increase lung compliance. Implementing individualized PEEP therapy, which also inhibited inflammatory reactions, improved the reduction of PPCs in Group A.\n\nAnother explanation was that intraoperative lung compliance was substantially higher, and driving pressure was lower in the individualized PEEP group in our study. This benefit may translate into a clinically significant reduction in pulmonary complications. A prior thoracic surgery study with 292 participants observed that the implementation of driving pressure-guided ventilation led to a decrease in postoperative pulmonary complications until postoperative Day 3 [ 35 ]. Nonetheless, a subsequent clinical trial revealed that, although driving pressure-guided ventilation enhanced pulmonary mechanics intraoperatively, it did not result in a reduced incidence of PPCs compared to conventional protective ventilation in lung resection surgery [ 43 ]. There are several possible explanations for the different results. First, they examined a more limited composite outcome based on the Melbourne Group Scale while we used the EPCO-recommended definitions. Methodological differences may be another explanation. Park M et al. used an incremental PEEP titration method, while we used a decremental PEEP titration method that is relatively easy to perform [ 27 , 34 ]. Moreover, our observation period was extended to postoperative Day 7.\n\nIn this study, the optimal PEEP obtained by PEEP decremental titration based on Cdyn was 9.04 ± 1.83 cm H 2 O, significantly different from the conventional setting of 5 cm H 2 O. Although the application of individualized PEEP was higher than the commonly used level, it did not increase substantially airway pressure. Hemodynamic parameters such as cardiac output also did not produce significant differences between the two groups. It was possible that the individualized PEEP selected based on the patient’s respiratory system was more in line with the physiological characteristics needed to maintain a balance between alveolar collapse and expansion. Thus, changes in the direction of PEEP had a slight effect on the hemodynamics of the patients.\n\nThis trial has several limitations. Initially, our research was limited by the scarcity of resources, which hindered us from recruiting an adequate sample size to thoroughly investigate the clinical outcomes of patients. To ensure data integrity, our study implemented stringent inclusion and exclusion criteria, potentially introducing bias into the results. Second, the potential adverse effects resulting from surgical manipulation of the operative lung may significantly contribute to pulmonary complications, thereby potentially confounding our ability to discern the impact of the exposure variable. Third, different stages of the tumor may also mediate different levels of inflammation. Fourth, the study utilized a fixed PEEP as the control rather than a static compliance-guided PEEP. As such, it remains unclear whether dynamic compliance-guided PEEP is superior to individualized static compliance-guided PEEP. Finally, there is a lack of measurement of intrinsic PEEP at zero PEEP. Given the current limitations of this study, further large-scale multicenter studies are still warranted to verify further the effect of individualized PEEP on postoperative pulmonary complications in thoracoscopic lobectomy.\n\nThe routine use of Cdyn-guided PEEP titration in everyday operating room settings appears to be both feasible and potentially cost-effective. This individualized ventilation strategy allows for real-time optimization of lung compliance, which may reduce the risk of postoperative pulmonary complications. Although the initial implementation may require investment in monitoring equipment, staff training, and slightly more time during anesthesia induction, these factors are outweighed by the potential for long-term savings through fewer postoperative complications, shorter hospital stays, and improved recovery trajectories. Therefore, the integration of Cdyn-guided PEEP into routine anesthesia practice is not only clinically beneficial but also justifiable in terms of resource allocation. Further efforts are warranted to standardize its application and evaluate its broader impact on perioperative outcomes.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn conclusion, the implementation of an individualized positive end-expiratory pressure strategy guided by dynamic pulmonary compliance can significantly reduce the occurrence of postoperative pulmonary complications in patients undergoing thoracoscopic lobectomy compared to a conventional protective ventilation approach. Our findings support the routine adoption of an individualized PEEP application based on each patient’s Cdyn during one-lung ventilation.\n\nSupplementary Information\n\nSupplementary Material 1.",
