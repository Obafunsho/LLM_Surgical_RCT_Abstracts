  "title": "Randomized controlled trial of intrathecal oxytocin on speed of recovery after hip arthroplasty",
  "abstract": "Recovery from surgery is quicker in the postpartum period and this may reflect oxytocin action in the spinal cord. We hypothesized that intrathecal injection of oxytocin would speed recovery from pain and disability after major surgery. Ninety-eight individuals undergoing elective total hip arthroplasty were randomized to receive either intrathecal oxytocin, 100 μg, or saline. Participants completed diaries assessing pain and opioid use daily and disability weekly, and wore an accelerometer beginning 2 weeks before surgery until 8 weeks after. Groups were compared using modelled, adjusted trajectories of these measures. The study was stopped early due to lack of funding. Ninety patients received intrathecal oxytocin (n=44) or saline (n=46) and were included in the analysis. There were no study drug-related adverse effects. Modelled pain trajectory, the primary analysis, did not differ between groups, either in pain on day of hospital discharge, [intercept: −0.1 (95%CI: −0.8 to 0.6), p = 0.746], or in reductions over time, [slope: 0.1 pain units per log of time (95%CI: 0 to 0.2), p = 0.057]. In planned secondary analyses, postoperative opioid use ended earlier in the oxytocin group and oxytocin treated patients walked nearly 1000 more steps daily at 8 weeks (p<0.001) and exhibited a clinically meaningful reduction in disability for the first 21 postoperative days (p=0.007) compared to saline placebo. Intrathecal oxytocin prior to hip replacement surgery does not speed recovery from worst daily pain. Secondary analyses suggest that further study of intrathecal oxytocin to speed functional recovery without worsening pain after surgery is warranted.",
