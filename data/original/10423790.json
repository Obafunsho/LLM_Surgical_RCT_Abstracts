  "full_text": "Introduction\n\nPeripheral arterial disease (PAD) describes a narrowing or occlusion of the peripheral arteries, which typically affects the lower limbs and is most often caused by atherosclerosis or atherothrombosis. 1 PAD may be asymptomatic or cause symptoms such as intermittent claudication (IC), where diminished circulation leads to pain in the lower limb on exertion that is relieved by rest. 2 More severe PAD can result in chronic limb-threatening ischaemia (CLTI), a clinical pattern representing threatened limb viability. CLTI is characterised by chronic, inadequate tissue perfusion at rest and is defined by ischaemic rest pain and/or tissue loss. 3 4 In the UK, around 2.2 million people have some degree of PAD, while the prevalence rises with age to 16% in those aged over 70 years. 2 5–7 Between 10% and 30% of individuals with PAD experience IC, 3 while the population prevalence of reported CLTI is between 0.4% and 2%. 3 4 Other risk factors for both the development and progression of PAD include male gender, smoking, hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidaemia and obesity. 3 5\n\nThe direct consequences of PAD include impaired quality of life, 2 8 psychosocial sequelae, 9 tissue loss (ulceration and gangrene) in CLTI, 3 amputation 10 and procedural complications resulting from invasive treatments. 2 Patients with PAD are three times more likely to die of cardiovascular causes including myocardial infarction, stroke and suffer from vascular dementia, renovascular disease and mesenteric disease. 1 11 12 Moreover, 10%–15% of patients presenting with IC die of cardiovascular causes over the following 5 years, while 20% experience non-fatal cardiovascular events. 8 Therefore, guidelines recommend the assessment of cardiovascular risk, and management of all key modifiable risk factors such as smoking, glycaemic control, dyslipidaemia, hypertension, body weight and exercise levels. 3 13\n\nAntithrombotic pharmacological therapy, which may involve one or more antiplatelet and/or anticoagulant agents, has been repeatedly demonstrated in randomised controlled trials (RCTs) to reduce occlusive vascular events or their recurrence. 14–22 However, the optimal antithrombotic regimen for the management of PAD is contentious, both overall and in key subpopulations such as those with diabetes. Multiple RCTs compared the investigational product to aspirin monotherapy, 14–16 19 which is not the recommended agent for the medical management of symptomatic PAD. 3 23 Furthermore, guidance from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) is incongruous; NICE Technology appraisal guidance 210 states “Clopidogrel is recommended as an option to prevent occlusive vascular events for people who have … PAD or multivascular disease”, 23 while NICE Technology appraisal guidance 607 states “Rivaroxaban plus aspirin is recommended … as an option for preventing atherothrombotic events in adults with coronary artery disease or symptomatic PAD who are at high risk of ischaemic events”. 24 Antithrombotic therapy for patients undergoing interventions such as surgical bypass or endovascular intervention has separate recommendations.\n\nThe current guidance on the medical management of PAD generates confusion for both clinicians and patients, while variation in clinical practice may cause harm. No published RCT has directly compared the two NICE recommended antithrombotic regimens, clopidogrel monotherapy and rivaroxaban plus aspirin, in patients with PAD. Furthermore, there is no RCT comparison of these antithrombotic medications in patients with PAD either underway or being planned. Therefore, this network meta-analysis (NMA) aims to address a critical unanswered question in daily clinical practice and understand the relative efficacy and risks associated with each antithrombotic regimen in preventing cardiovascular events, limb loss, death and key adverse events (AEs) in different patient groups with PAD.\n\nAims\n\nTo understand the relative efficacy and safety of previously investigated antithrombotic medications in preventing major cardiovascular events, limb loss, mortality and bleeding events in patients with symptomatic lower limb PAD. A secondary aim is to investigate whether different patient groups have superior outcomes from different antithrombotic regimens.\n\nMethod\n\nThe full protocol is available online, 25 but in summary, a systematic review and NMA of antithrombotic agents for patients with PAD will be undertaken. The review process will run from November 2022 to October 2023. The review is registered with the PROSPERO database, 26 and will be reported in line with the latest Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines and relevant extensions for search strategies and NMAs. 27–29\n\nTypes of studies\n\nAll published and available unpublished RCT trial results will be included. All other study designs, including cross-over study designs and non-randomised studies, will be excluded.\n\nTypes of participants\n\nPeople with PAD will be eligible, defined as (1) symptoms and a diagnosis of PAD by a clinician with experience in PAD and/or (2) a previous procedure to treat PAD (revascularisation procedure or amputation) and/or (3) objective evidence of lower limb arterial malperfusion. The Ankle Brachial Pressure Index (ABPI) is the most common objective measure of lower limb perfusion. Differing definitions of PAD exist using ABPI; for the avoidance of doubt, an ABPI of ≤0.9 will be used as objective evidence of malperfusion.\n\nNo limits will be set on age, country or previous therapy.\n\nIt is known that trials relevant to this review included patients with a variety of atherosclerotic disease phenotypes (eg, coronary heart disease and/or ischaemic stroke in addition to PAD). Additionally, some trials are known to have included patients with carotid artery atherosclerotic disease within the PAD subgroup. These will be included provided that (1) a defined set of patients with symptomatic PAD was included, (2) one or more outcomes was specifically reported for the PAD subgroup and (3) patients without lower limb PAD do not comprise greater than 25% of the PAD subgroup but do have some other form of atherosclerotic pathology.\n\nTypes of interventions\n\nTrials comparing one antithrombotic regimen to another, or to placebo, will be eligible for inclusion. Antithrombotic medication regimen will be defined as any individual or combination of medications listed in the British National Formulary as an antiplatelet, anticoagulant, glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor ( online supplemental material ) and/or any other individual or combination of medications reporting to inhibit platelets or fibrin aggregation in thrombus formation. 30 No restriction will be placed on dose or route of administration. However, studies which combine medication regimens with non-medication-based cointerventions in a single arm will be excluded. The combinations of antithrombotic agents (eg, clopidogrel with aspirin) will be analysed as separate groups to the individual agents.\n\nPatient and public involvement (PPI)\n\nThis research proposal was developed with assistance from the local NIHR Research Design Service and was informed by PPI work with a focus group of people with lived experience of PAD. 31 Themes emerging from the PPI group included surprise about the level of cardiovascular risk for patients with PAD and shock at the discordance in current guidelines. The PPI work highlighted that people with PAD most valued being alive without disabling complications such as stroke, heart attack or amputation, and felt that further research was important to establish the best antithrombotic agent/combination and if possible offer tailored advice for key patient groups.\n\nPlanned further PPI\n\nFollowing data extraction, a visual representation of the network for each outcome will be created. This, along with the composite outcomes from studies that are being combined, risk of bias and difference in patient demographics of each included study will be discussed at a PPI focus group. This will ascertain their perception about the quality of evidence included in the study, which by extension may inform decision-making about treatment options recommended to patients. This will occur prior to the analyses being run, thereby avoiding any potential bias from the outcomes of the NMA.\n\nThe results of the analysis are likely to be numerous and complex in their nature. A second PPI focus group will discuss the outcomes of the analysis and distill the results down to a meaningful level for patients and members of the public to interpret. This is intended to facilitate dissemination and ensure that patients with PAD can access the information to make an informed decision about the best management for them with their doctor. A summary of these PPI findings will be reported jointly with the analysis.\n\nSearch methods\n\nAn information specialist developed a comprehensive literature search in line with the guidelines laid out in the Cochrane handbook, aiming for a high level of sensitivity. 32 The search strategy underwent peer review by the Cochrane Vascular information specialist, prior to being run. 32 Searches will be performed, in English only, on Medline, Embase, Cochrane (CENTRAL), Web of Science and Google Scholar. Searches for ongoing trials will be repeated via the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry platform search portal, with supplemental searches as recommended in the Cochrane handbook. 31 All databases will be searched from their inception. No limits will be placed on study language, although a study will be excluded if a translation is not available or feasible to arrange. The reference lists of included studies will be hand searched for further articles. All searches will be repeated prior to the end of the meta-analysis to identify any subsequently published literature before the dataset is locked.\n\nSelection of studies\n\nThe output of all searches will be imported into Covidence systematic review management software and screened for duplicates. 33 Once duplicates have been removed, two team members will independently screen the list of original papers by title and abstract to identify all RCTs of antithrombotic medication reporting one of the primary outcomes. For identified studies, all additional data sources will be sought using focused searches for further published articles, published letters, trial registry entries and requests for clinical study reports submitted to medical regulatory authorities. These documents will be bundled and screened in totality against the eligibility criteria independently by two blinded reviewers. The reviewers will attempt to resolve any disagreements once unblinded and a third reviewer will act as a tie-breaker where no consensus can be reached.\n\nData extraction and management\n\nTwo team members will extract the data from the full text and online supplemental materials of included studies into a prepiloted data collection form in Covidence developed in collaboration with the statistician. Data on RCT design, participant baseline characteristics, study interventions, methods, all reported study outcomes, results and the authors’ conclusions will be extracted and recorded as detailed in the Cochrane handbook.\n\nWhere patients with PAD represent a subgroup of the overall study population, data will be collected for both the study population as a whole and the patient with PAD subgroup where available. The details of the PAD subgroup including disease status and proportion of non-lower limb atherosclerotic patients will also be recorded. This will permit a sensitivity analysis of the likelihood that using whole-study data rather than subgroup-specific data would introduce bias within the analysis of AEs. Where multiple timepoints in follow-up are reported, the longest timepoint shall primarily be used for all outcomes, with subsequent sensitivity analyses exploring the effect of the timepoint of outcome measurement.\n\nObjectives\n\nPrimary objectives\n\nSecondary objectives\n\nOutcomes\n\nCoprimary outcomes\n\nCoprimary efficacy outcome 1\n\nComposite of MACE, as defined in the available literature, but to include acute coronary syndrome, ischaemic stroke and cardiovascular death.\n\nCoprimary efficacy outcome 2\n\nComposite of MALE, as defined in the available literature, but to include acute limb ischaemia (and embolectomy/thrombectomy/thrombolysis), major amputation (at or above ankle) or need for peripheral revascularisation.\n\nCoprimary efficacy outcome 3\n\nAll-cause mortality.\n\nCoprimary safety outcome 4\n\nMajor bleeding, as defined in the available literature, but to include fatal bleeding, symptomatic bleeding in a critical area or organ, such as intracranial, intraspinal, intraocular, retroperitoneal, intra-articular or pericardial, or intramuscular with compartment syndrome, bleeding causing a fall in haemoglobin level of 20 g/L or more and/or bleeding requiring transfusion of red cells or whole blood.\n\nSecondary outcomes\n\nSecondary efficacy outcomes will include individual components of MACE and MALE outcomes; cardiovascular death, acute coronary syndrome, ischaemic stroke, major amputation, acute limb ischaemia, thrombectomy/thrombolysis and need for a subsequent revascularisation procedure.\n\nSecondary safety outcomes will include individual outcomes of fatal bleeding, gastrointestinal bleeding, intracranial bleeding, severe bleeding into any major organ, bleeding requiring blood transfusion and/or return to theatre, and bleeding requiring admission to hospital, venous thromboembolism, rash, discontinuation of assigned therapy for any reason, gastrointestinal symptoms resulting in discontinuation of assigned therapy. Additionally, any further drug-related AEs reported will be included to allow for the identification of unexpected AEs. Adherence to therapy by any quantitative measure will be included, where reported.\n\nRisk-of-bias assessment\n\nTwo study members with domain and meta-analysis expertise will independently assess all included trials for risk of bias using the ‘Risk-of-Bias V.2’ tool, 34 then areas of uncertainty in these assessments will look to be resolved by reference to collateral information sources as described above (trial registries and regulatory submissions) and contact with the primary investigators if necessary. A risk-of-bias assessment will be undertaken separately for primary outcome analyses and subgroup analyses.\n\nMeasures of treatment effects\n\nFor all binary outcomes, the preferred data to collect will be absolute numbers of events and numbers at risk, and risk ratios will be calculated. If the absolute number of events is not available, risk or ORs with defined CIs and/or SE will be the preferred alternative. For continuous outcomes, the mean and SD of the group will be the first choice of measure.\n\nUnit of analysis issues\n\nAnalyses will be conducted at medication regimen level. Dose will not be primarily considered but a secondary sensitivity analysis on the primary outcomes will be undertaken to see if any dose effects are evident. It is not anticipated that any trials will report data in another manner regarding this; however, advice will be sought from the statistician should this occur.\n\nMissing data\n\nOnly published data will be analysed. Missing data will be considered within the risk-of-bias assessment. If data is made available through direct correspondence, it will be published as an online supplemental appendix to the review and in the studies data repository.\n\nTransitivity\n\nRecruitment criteria differ between the RCTs and as such the transitivity assumption may be threatened. This is perceived to particularly be the case when considering trials of stable PAD compared with trials of periprocedural/postprocedural PAD. The validity of the transitivity assumption will be assessed quantitatively by considering the incoherence factor, which involves the comparison of direct and indirect effective estimates for each pairwise comparison in the network, where they both exist; this will be evaluated using both the local and global strategies detailed in the Cochrane handbook. 31\n\nAssessment of reporting\n\nAspirin is expected to be the most common comparator within RCTs in this NMA, which will facilitate exploration of publication bias using comparison-adjusted funnel plots. 35 The team has considered selective reporting within trials throughout the study design phase and will qualitatively consider the effect of this during subsequent phases.\n\nData synthesis\n\nThe full analysis plan is available online. 36 Studies will be summarised including the direct comparisons made, population characteristics and characteristics of those patients with PAD. The medication regimen for both overall and PAD populations will be summarised separately.\n\nAntithrombotic regimens will be grouped into common nodes based on the drugs used in that arm. A network diagram will be constructed for each outcome, where the size of each node is proportional to the number of patients assigned to that intervention, and the thickness of each line is based on the inverse of the variance of the direct comparison. Interventions that are absent from a particular network will be highlighted.\n\nAnalysis of primary and secondary outcomes will be undertaken on a whole network basis, subject to the checks of assumptions outlined above, wherever networks can be formed based on published data. All NMAs will create pairwise comparisons of medication regimens, and a ranking of all medication regimens will be produced with risk of bias estimates published alongside. Subgroup analyses are discussed further below.\n\nWe anticipate a complex NMA based on prior knowledge. The analysis is planned by the statistician (CH) in R Statistical Software (V.4.1), 37 primarily using the netmeta package. 38 If the transitivity assumption is violated as the result of differing RCT recruitment criteria, then separate networks will be established to allow meaningful analysis of these data.\n\nSubgroup analysis\n\nThe PPI group highlighted the importance of being able to provide individualised recommendations to patients. Therefore, the intent is to extract all published results for subgroups and perform all NMAs that are possible. Anticipated subgroups are PAD state (such as IC and CLTI), sex, age, ethnicity, key comorbidities and periprocedural type/status. We also intend to analyse any other subgroups that have sufficient data published but are not anticipated.\n\nSubgroup analyses as described above, will be undertaken wherever subnetworks can be formed based on published data. The inclusion of these subanalyses will likely be susceptible to non-reporting bias as they are less likely to have formed part of the original RCT per-protocol analysis plan. Candidate interventions that are absent due to non-publication of a particular subgroup analysis will be clearly identified.\n\nSensitivity analysis\n\nPrespecified sensitivity analyses, as permitted by available data, will explore consistency in the findings regarding (1) patients with stable versus periprocedural PAD, (2) primary outcomes limited to patients with PAD only (to ascertain whether AE rates in trials of mixed atherosclerotic disease, eg, coronary heart disease and stroke, as well as PAD, are applicable to the PAD only population), (3) inclusion of studies at low risk of bias only, (4) restriction of included patients to those with IC and/or CLTI in isolation, (5) primary outcomes by dose of antithrombotic agents (variable dosing strategies, particularly of aspirin, are anticipated to affect AE rates) and (6) shorter and longer timepoints (as the optimal antithrombotic regimen may change over time for patients with PAD). Further post hoc sensitivity analyses may be developed and will be reported transparently as post hoc in the final report.\n\nConfidence in cumulative evidence\n\nA summary of findings table will be constructed for the key outcomes, including MACE, MALE, all-cause mortality, major amputation as an individualised outcome and major bleeding. The underlying quality of evidence for each of these outcomes will be assessed according to the GRADE framework for NMAs, which classifies interventions by both the relative treatment effect size and certainty of evidence. 39 40\n\nEthics and dissemination\n\nClinical impact\n\nThe results will be presented to clinical domain specialists at UK national and international vascular and endovascular conferences. The presentations will be made to key stakeholders including NICE, vascular and endovascular societies/charities and the all-party parliamentary group for vascular and venous disease. The lead applicants’ institutions public relations team will maximise the visibility and availability of the results, both to patients and clinicians, through social and traditional media. The results will be disseminated through the UK national societies of vascular specialists and general practitioners to maximise the impact on clinical practice. The authors anticipate that the results of the research would be sufficient to trigger a review of the current NICE guidelines.\n\nPatient impact\n\nThe patient accessible report codeveloped with the PPI group will be submitted to UK vascular disease charities, such as the Circulation Foundation and the British Heart Foundation, for publication on their websites.\n\nData storage\n\nThe data generated from this research will be an essential output. The data collected from screening, risk assessments, study results and statistical coding will be made available on the lead applicants institution research data repository to ensure ongoing future access. This will facilitate research efficiency if/when future trials become available, and the analysis requires updating. We will seek to establish a resource that can be added-to, re-evaluated or reanalysed with future trail data. A link to the data repository will be provided in the PROSPERO record for the systematic review.\n\nPublications\n\nThe authors anticipate that the primary paper will be published, open access, in a high-impact cardiovascular journal. Any further publications will also be submitted, open access.",
