  "abstract": "Introduction: Opioids are commonly used for postoperative pain management but are associated with adverse effects and risk of dependence, potentially hindering recovery. This systematic review evaluates the impact of opioid-sparing analgesic strategies on postoperative pain and functional recovery to provide evidence-based guidance for clinical practice and future research.\n\nMethods: A comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted by searching PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library for randomized controlled trials on adult surgical patients from the inception of each database to July 10, 2024. The primary outcome was the total morphine consumption within 24 h postoperatively.

The total morphine consumption was reduced, with a mean difference (MD) of −9.47, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) [−13, −5.95]. The postoperative pain score at 24 h was lower than in the control group, with an MD of −0.72 (95% CI [−0.97, −0.47]). Patient satisfaction was higher than in the control group, with an MD of 0.88 (95% CI [0.36, 1.40]). There were no significant differences in length of stay or recovery quality compared to the control group ( P = 0.7, P = 0.48). The incidence of PONV was lower than the control group, with an odds ratio (OR) of 0.73 (95% CI [0.59, 0.90]), and the incidence of pruritus was also lower than in the control group, with an OR of 0.64 (95% CI [0.41, 0.98]).

Acute postoperative pain affects up to 80% of patients, with fewer than 50% achieving sufficient pain relief [ 1 ].\n\nInsufficient postoperative pain management is associated with delayed physical recovery, reduced patient satisfaction, and an increased risk of developing chronic pain [ 2 ]. Effective postoperative analgesia allows patients to begin rehabilitation sooner and reduces adverse outcomes. Opioids play an essential role in pain management; recent studies indicate that 89.6% of patients receive opioid treatment postoperatively [ 3 ]. However, opioids are also associated with adverse events, such as postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV), sedation, dizziness, pruritus, urinary retention, and respiratory depression, collectively termed opioid-related adverse effects [ 4 ]. In 2021, over 100,000 deaths in the United States were attributed to drug overdoses, with opioids responsible for more than 75,000 of these fatalities [ 5 ].\n\nThe concept of opioid-sparing analgesia has been discussed in many publications, though no universally accepted definition currently exists. It is commonly defined as the use of non-opioid medications and regional anesthetic techniques (including neuraxial and peripheral nerve blocks) to reduce opioid consumption and associated adverse risks as much as possible, while maintaining adequate analgesia [ 6 – 9 ]. Reducing opioid use not only helps minimize well-documented short-term adverse effects such as nausea, vomiting, sedation, pruritus, constipation, and urinary retention, but also mitigates the risk of long-term complications, including chronic postsurgical pain, opioid-induced hyperalgesia, and immunomodulatory effects [ 10 ].\n\nThe aim of this review is to systematically evaluate all available evidence on the effectiveness of opioid-sparing analgesia in improving postoperative pain and recovery outcomes, including morphine consumption, postoperative pain levels, opioid-related adverse effects, length of hospital stay, quality of recovery, and patient satisfaction.\n\nMethods\n\nThe protocol for this meta-analysis has been registered with PROSPERO (CRD42024579882). In preparing this report, we ensured adherence to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement to promote transparency and comprehensiveness in the evaluation process and the reporting of results.\n\nInclusion Criteria\n\nWe included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of adult patients (aged ≥ 18 years) who received opioid-sparing analgesia following surgery. This included the use of systemic non-opioid medications (such as ketamine, lidocaine, magnesium, gabapentin, pregabalin, dexmedetomidine, clonidine, dexamethasone, paracetamol, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [NSAIDs]), local infiltration, and nerve blocks. Control groups received either opioid-based analgesia or placebo with appropriate opioid rescue medications. All types of surgery that required the presence of an anesthetist were considered eligible.\n\nTrials involving two or more interventions were excluded, as we aimed to assess the effect of a single intervention. Trials in which the intervention was administered after discharge were also excluded, as their outcomes could be influenced by other factors. Additional exclusions included trials that provided only placebo to patients, trials in which the rescue analgesia was non-opioid, and trials involving epidural administration.\n\nSearch Strategy\n\nInitially, we planned to conduct a systematic search of the China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Wanfang Data, and China Biology Medicine disc (CBM) databases. However, after an initial search, we found a limited number of relevant articles that met the inclusion criteria, and the overall quality of the studies was low. As a result, we did not proceed with a formal search of Chinese databases. Ultimately, relevant studies were identified through a search of PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library, covering the period from the inception of each database up to July 10, 2024. A comprehensive search strategy was developed, with all search terms and strategies reviewed by an experienced methodology expert. To further enhance the accuracy and comprehensiveness of the search, we also conducted a detailed review of the reference lists of all included studies. This additional step aimed to identify studies that might not have been retrieved through database searches. The search terms are presented as supplementary material, and the detailed search strategy for each database is provided in Supplementary Material 1 .\n\nStudy Selection\n\nThe initial screening of titles and abstracts identified through the search strategy was independently performed by the first two authors, who excluded irrelevant articles. Subsequently, the full texts of the remaining studies were independently assessed by the same two authors to identify studies meeting the prespecified inclusion criteria. Any disagreements were resolved through thorough discussion to reach consensus; if consensus could not be achieved, the final decision was made by an adjudicator.\n\nData Extraction\n\nData were extracted by two independent reviewers and verified by a third reviewer. Discrepancies were resolved by the lead investigator. Following the recommendations of the Cochrane Handbook, data from the studies were extracted using a predesigned Excel spreadsheet with relevant fields. If the results were reported only in graphical form, data were extracted from the graphics using a digital measurement programme (WebPlotDigitizer).\n\nOutcomes\n\nThe primary outcome was the total morphine consumption within 24 h postoperatively. Secondary outcomes included postoperative pain scores at 24 h, patient satisfaction, length of stay, quality of recovery, and opioid-related adverse effects such as PONV, sedation, dizziness, drowsiness, pruritus, urinary retention, and hypotension. If 24 h data were unavailable, the closest available data point to 24 h was used. To ensure comparability across studies using different opioid agents and administration routes, all reported opioid dosages were extracted and converted to intravenous morphine milligram equivalents (IMME) [ 11 ]. The opioid agents included morphine, fentanyl, sufentanil, tramadol, hydromorphone, and oxycodone. Due to variations in the predefined definitions of dynamic pain scores (such as coughing, swallowing, walking), only resting pain scores were selected as the outcome measure. We selected the numerical rating scale (NRS) as the standard pain measure and converted other pain scales to the NRS (on a scale of 0 to 10; lower scores indicate less pain) [ 12 – 15 ]. Based on previously established literature, the minimal clinically important difference (MCID) was set at 10 mg of morphine equivalent and one point on the NRS for pain scores [ 16 – 18 ]. The criteria for conducting a meta-analysis were studies having the same outcomes, data that could be combined, and at least three studies reporting the data.\n\nCertainty of Evidence\n\nThe quality of the pooled results was assessed using the GRADEpro GDT online tool ( https://gradepro.org/ ) as recommended by the GRADE guidelines. The assessment items included risk of bias, inconsistency, indirectness, imprecision, and publication bias. Two authors independently evaluated the quality of evidence for the included studies. Based on the level of risk of bias according to these criteria, the pooled results were classified from high to very low quality.\n\nRisk of Bias Assessment\n\nThe risk of bias in the included studies was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool for RCTs [ 19 ]. This tool evaluates seven domains of bias: random sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding of participants and personnel, blinding of outcome assessment, incomplete outcome data, selective reporting, and other sources of bias. Two independent reviewers performed the assessment, and any disagreements were resolved through discussion. If consensus could not be reached, the final decision was made by an adjudicator.\n\nStatistical Analysis\n\nFor continuous outcome data, the mean difference (MD) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated. For dichotomous outcome data, odds ratios (OR) with 95% CI were computed. In cases where outcomes were reported as medians with interquartile ranges, these were converted to estimated means and standard deviations (SD) using the Hozo method [ 20 ]. Data analysis was conducted using Review Manager software (RevMan, version 5.3.5). All meta-analyses were performed using a random-effects model. Heterogeneity among studies was assessed using the I 2 statistic, with I 2 values categorized as low (< 25%), moderate (25–50%), and high (> 50%) [ 21 ]. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to assess the impact of heterogeneity in the included studies. Publication bias was assessed using funnel plot asymmetry.\n\nEthical Approval\n\nThis study is a systematic review and meta-analysis of previously published studies and does not involve any new studies with human participants or animals performed by any of the authors. Ethical approval was therefore not required.\n\nResults\n\nA literature search was conducted through PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library databases. After removing duplicates, 9092 articles were identified. Based on title and abstract screening, 8613 articles were excluded, leaving 489 articles for full-text review. After full-text screening, 58 articles were included, each representing a unique study. The PRISMA selection process flowchart is shown in Fig. 1 .\n\nStudy Characteristics\n\nWe extracted the following study characteristics: first author's name, year of publication, country, type of surgery, sample size, intervention, and primary outcomes. The characteristics of the included studies are presented in Table 1 .\n\nRisk of Bias Assessment\n\nAll included studies were RCTs. Among them, 50 trials were double-blind placebo-controlled, 56 trials used the random sequence generation process, and 34 trials used the allocation concealment method. Therefore, 38 trials were assessed as having a low risk of bias, 14 trials were identified as having an uncertain risk of bias, and six trials were assessed as having a high risk of bias. The summary of risk assessment is shown in Figs. 2 and 3 .\n\nAnalysis and Synthesis of Evidence\n\nA total of 61 sets of data were extracted from 58 studies (three studies included two different intervention groups), involving 5614 patients. The studies investigated the following interventions: NSAIDs (11 studies), paracetamol (10 studies), ketamine (9 studies), alpha-2 agonists (five studies, including dexmedetomidine and clonidine), dexamethasone (one study), magnesium (one study), local wound infiltration (seven studies), and nerve blocks (14 studies). Gabapentin and pregabalin were predominantly administered preoperatively in the studies, but no studies meeting the inclusion criteria were found.\n\nPostoperative 24-Hour Total Morphine Consumption\n\nThe total morphine consumption was analyzed in 28 studies, involving 2013 patients. Opioid-sparing analgesia resulted in lower total morphine consumption compared to the control group (MD −9.47, 95% CI [−13.00, −5.95], I 2 = 99%). Level of evidence: moderate quality. Forest plots are shown in Fig. 4 . (Funnel plots are provided in Supplementary Materials 2 .)\n\nPostoperative 24-Hour Pain Scores\n\nA total of 34 studies, involving 3320 patients, assessed postoperative 24 h pain scores as an outcome measure. Opioid-sparing analgesia was associated with a reduction in postoperative pain scores (MD −0.72, 95% CI [−0.97, −0.47], I 2 = 98%). Level of evidence: low quality. Forest plots are shown in Fig. 5 . (Funnel plots are provided in Supplementary Materials 3 .)\n\nSubgroup Analysis\n\nTo explore the reasons for the high heterogeneity in the analysis, a subgroup analysis was conducted based on the different interventions (NSAIDs, alpha-2 agonists, paracetamol, ketamine, local infiltration, and nerve blocks). The results of subgroup analyses are presented in Tables 2 and 3 .\n\nIn the subgroup analysis of total morphine consumption, NSAIDs, acetaminophen, ketamine, and nerve blocks were associated with a statistically significant reduction in postoperative opioid use ( P < 0.05), with NSAIDs reaching and exceeding the MCID threshold of 10 mg. Although α2-adrenergic receptor agonists showed a MD greater than 10 mg, the result was not statistically significant ( P = 0.14).\n\nIn the subgroup analysis of pain scores, NSAIDs, α2-adrenergic receptor agonists, acetaminophen, and ketamine demonstrated statistically significant postoperative analgesic effects ( P < 0.05), with acetaminophen notably exceeding the MCID threshold of one point.\n\nLength of Stay and Quality of Recovery\n\nSeven studies investigated length of stay, showing no significant difference compared to the control group (MD −0.07, 95% CI [−0.41, 0.28], P = 0.7, I 2 = 42%). Level of evidence: low quality. (See supplementary material 5 ).\n\nFour studies reported quality of recovery, with one using the QOR-40 scale, showing no significant difference compared to the control group. Three studies used the QOR-15 scale, and there was no notable difference between the two groups (MD −0.98, 95% CI [−3.71, 1.75], P = 0.48, I 2 = 49%). Level of evidence: Low quality. (See supplementary material 6 ).\n\nPatient Satisfaction\n\nSix studies investigated patient satisfaction, with opioid-sparing analgesia associated with higher satisfaction compared to the control group (MD 0.88, 95% CI [0.36, 1.40], P = 0.0009, I 2 = 79%). Level of evidence: low quality. (See supplementary material 7 ).\n\nOpioid-Related Adverse Effects\n\nA total of 16 studies, involving 2529 patients, examined PONV as an outcome measure. Opioid-sparing analgesia was associated with a lower incidence of PONV compared to the control group (OR 0.73, 95% CI [0.59, 0.90], P = 0.004, I 2 = 5%). Level of evidence: moderate quality. Forest plots are shown in Fig. 6 .\n\nFourteen studies reported the incidence of pruritus, involving 1409 patients. Opioid-sparing analgesia was associated with a lower incidence of pruritus compared to the control group (OR 0.64, 95% CI [0.41, 0.98], P = 0.04, I 2 = 0%). Level of evidence: high quality. (See supplementary material 8 ).\n\nFive studies reported the incidence of dizziness, with no significant difference between groups (OR 0.95, 95% CI [0.46, 1.98], P = 0.90, I 2 = 0%). Four studies reported the incidence of drowsiness, showing no significant difference (OR 2.63, 95% CI [0.92, 7.53], P = 0.07, I 2 = 0%). Three studies observed the incidence of sedation, with no significant difference (OR 1.33, 95% CI [0.27, 6.57], P = 0.73, I 2 = 11%). Three studies observed hypotension, with no significant difference (OR 0.82, 95% CI [0.17, 3.95], P = 0.80, I 2 = 15%). Three studies examined urinary retention, with no significant difference (OR 0.93, 95% CI [0.54, 1.61], P = 0.80, I 2 = 0%). All of the above are low-quality evidence. (See supplementary material 9 ).\n\nSensitivity Analysis\n\nTo test the robustness of the results, we attempted to exclude all studies identified as having a high risk of bias or an unclear risk of bias across all domains. The sensitivity analysis indicated no significant changes in the pooled effect estimates or confidence intervals for the pain outcomes compared to the original meta-analysis.\n\nOther Outcomes\n\nThree studies reported on respiratory depression. One study observed no postoperative respiratory depression, while the other two studies showed no difference in the incidence of respiratory depression compared to the control group. Two studies recorded hypertension, with similar incidence rates between the opioid-sparing analgesia and control groups. One study assessed bradycardia and found no difference compared to the control group.\n\nOne study on magnesium demonstrated a significant reduction in morphine consumption and improved pain control, although the effect was small and of limited clinical significance. One study on dexamethasone showed that oral dexamethasone could alleviate postoperative pain, but there was no difference in opioid consumption between the two groups. One study on lidocaine demonstrated that 1% lidocaine reduced postoperative pain scores and opioid consumption, with no adverse effects. These studies were not included in the meta-analysis.\n\nDiscussion\n\nIn this meta-analysis, our findings demonstrate that opioid-sparing analgesia is associated with reduced postoperative morphine consumption, lower pain scores, decreased incidence of PONV and pruritus, and higher patient satisfaction. In the subgroup analysis, NSAIDs showed the most pronounced opioid-sparing effect, exceeding the 10 mg MCID and indicating clear clinical relevance. Acetaminophen was the only intervention to exceed the one-point MCID in pain scores, suggesting a perceptible and significant reduction in pain from the patient's perspective [ 79 ]. Although ketamine and alpha-2 agonists did not reach the MCID thresholds individually, their combined opioid-sparing and analgesic effects make them valuable components of multimodal analgesia protocols. These findings are consistent with previous evidence. For example, a study by Aryaie et al. demonstrated that patients receiving paracetamol reported lower pain scores, reduced opioid consumption in colorectal surgery, and significantly shorter time to recovery of bowel function, showing the benefits of opioid-sparing strategies [ 80 ]. Qureshi et al. noted that patients treated with NSAIDs had a lower risk of requiring rescue analgesia, and that NSAIDs were the preferred analgesics, with paracetamol being a suitable alternative [ 82 ]. Other studies have suggested that a combination of NSAIDs and paracetamol provides more effective postoperative pain control and higher safety compared to opioid-based regimens [ 82 ]. A systematic review indicated that intravenous ketamine not only reduced postoperative opioid consumption but also delayed the time to first opioid use after surgery. However, its clinical application is limited by dose-dependent neuropsychiatric side effects [ 83 ]. Another meta-analysis confirmed that perioperative use of alpha-2 agonists can reduce postoperative opioid consumption and pain intensity. Dexmedetomidine was associated with an increased risk of postoperative bradycardia, while clonidine was linked to the occurrence of hypotension [ 84 ]. Additionally, a subgroup analysis revealed that local infiltration and nerve blocks did not improve postoperative 24 h pain control. This may be related to the limited number of studies on local infiltration and insufficient sample sizes. Nerve blocks only assessed single-dose block types, with a relatively short duration of action, which may lead to rebound pain [ 85 ], directly influencing pain scores.\n\nRecent studies have shown that opioid-sparing analgesia offers better outcomes in pain control, as well as in reducing nausea and vomiting, thereby enhancing postoperative patient comfort [ 86 ]. Our findings confirm this conclusion, demonstrating that opioid-sparing analgesia reduces the incidence of PONV and pruritus, while the rates of dizziness, sedation, drowsiness, urinary retention, and hypotension were similar to the control group. Additionally, patient satisfaction was higher. However, some studies have pointed out that in outpatient surgeries, opioid-sparing analgesia may be associated with a higher incidence of dizziness, which could be related to the analgesic agents used [ 87 ]. Recovery quality is associated with dimensions such as pain control, emotional status, sleep quality, and independence, which are subjective, so the limited number of studies does not allow for definitive conclusions. Length of stay showed no significant difference between the groups ( P = 0.7). Ke et al. demonstrated that implementing opioid-sparing strategies intraoperatively reduced hospital stay [ 88 ]. However, this effect may depend on the specific type of surgery and individual patient factors, and further research is needed to confirm these findings. With the ongoing opioid crisis and the rising morbidity, mortality, and costs associated with opioid use, prioritizing opioid-sparing analgesia pain management is crucial [ 89 ]. For instance, PONV, one of the most common opioid-related adverse effects, occurs less frequently with reduced opioid use. A lower incidence of PONV translates into shorter stays in the PACU, decreased workload for nursing staff, and reduced need for antiemetic medications, thereby lowering nursing labor costs and the overall consumption of healthcare resources. In the long term, minimizing opioid use may also reduce the risk of patients developing chronic opioid use or dependence following surgery.\n\nLimitations and future research directions : This study included all types of surgeries and considered opioid-sparing analgesia as an overarching strategy incorporating multiple interventions. This may explain the generally high heterogeneity in the combined results. Although we performed sensitivity analyses (e.g., excluding studies at high risk of bias) and detailed subgroup analyses (e.g., by type of intervention) to verify the robustness of the main findings from multiple perspectives, certain outcome measures still exhibited significant unexplained heterogeneity. This suggests the presence of unmeasured confounding factors, representing a methodological limitation of the study. Moreover, such pronounced inconsistency also reduces the certainty of the evidence for many outcomes. Future research should consider employing meta-regression or multivariable meta-analysis models to quantitatively explore potential sources of heterogeneity, thereby improving the interpretability and reliability of systematic reviews. The present analysis did not include dynamic pain scores, which may have underestimated the clinical value of certain interventions in facilitating early postoperative mobilization—particularly relevant in procedures where functional recovery is prioritized (e.g., orthopedic, thoracic, and laparoscopic surgeries). Future studies should prioritize the standardization of dynamic pain assessment methods and metrics to enhance clinical relevance and comparability. In addition, opioid-related adverse events such as sedation, dizziness, and respiratory depression should be predefined as secondary outcomes, and studies should be adequately powered to more fully assess their potential impact.\n\nFuture research should investigate the influence of psychological factors—such as preoperative anxiety, pain catastrophizing, and depressive symptoms—on postoperative pain perception and recovery outcomes. Clinical heterogeneity, including surgical approach (e.g., open vs. minimally invasive or robot-assisted surgery), surgical site, and procedure duration, may also affect analgesic efficacy and should be accounted for. In clinical practice, it is recommended to refer to the PROSPECT (Procedure-Specific Pain Management) guidelines to develop individualized pain management pathways based on specific surgical procedures, utilizing multimodal analgesia strategies and tailored pharmacologic choices to optimize postoperative pain control [ 90 , 91 ]. Additionally, further research is needed to evaluate combinations of drugs and techniques within multimodal analgesia, aiming to achieve an optimal balance between pain relief and adverse effects.\n\nThe American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) strongly recommends the use of multimodal analgesia strategies whenever possible in its guidelines for perioperative acute pain management, explicitly identifying acetaminophen, NSAIDs, and regional anesthesia techniques as key components of postoperative pain control [ 92 ]. Our findings provide supporting evidence for these recommendations, confirming the feasibility and clinical benefits of implementing opioid-sparing strategies in postoperative pain management. By reducing the incidence of opioid-related adverse effects, these strategies may accelerate patient recovery and enhance satisfaction—outcomes that align closely with the core goals of Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) protocols [ 93 , 94 ].\n\nClinical practice recommendations : NSAIDs demonstrate clear advantages in reducing opioid consumption and improving postoperative analgesia and should be prioritized in multimodal analgesia strategies. Acetaminophen provides significant pain relief and is recommended as a foundational analgesic, preferably in combination with NSAIDs. Ketamine significantly reduces opioid use and shows pain score improvement approaching the MCID threshold; it can be considered as an adjunct analgesic with optimized dosing and patient selection. Some studies suggest that alpha-2 agonists provide analgesic benefits, but further research is needed to confirm the reliability of these findings. Nerve blocks have shown opioid-sparing effects but limited duration of efficacy; therefore, they are not recommended as standalone interventions. Local infiltration has not demonstrated meaningful opioid-sparing or analgesic effects, possibly due to a limited number of studies and small sample sizes; more high-quality clinical research is needed to explore its role in postoperative pain management.\n\nSummary\n\nNSAIDs – Clear opioid-sparing and analgesic effects.\n\nAcetaminophen – Most effective intervention for reducing pain scores.\n\nKetamine – Clinical benefit approaches MCID threshold.\n\nAlpha-2 agonists – Show potential analgesic effects; evidence remains inconclusive.\n\nNerve blocks – Single dose has limited sustained efficacy.\n\nLocal infiltration – No meaningful clinical benefit demonstrated.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe results of this meta-analysis indicate that, compared to opioid-based analgesia, opioid-sparing analgesic strategies are associated with reduced morphine consumption within 24 h postoperatively, lower pain scores, and a decreased incidence of PONV and pruritus. Patient satisfaction was also improved. The findings will help clinicians make evidence-based decisions for postoperative pain management.\n\nSupplementary Information\n\nBelow is the link to the electronic supplementary material.
