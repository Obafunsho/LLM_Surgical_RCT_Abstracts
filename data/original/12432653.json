  "full_text": "Introduction\n\nSurgery remains the treatment of choice for early-stage non-small cell lung cancer in surgically fit patients. Lung cancer surgery is most often performed using single-lung ventilation, in which only the unaffected lung is ventilated to ensure adequate oxygenation. The affected lung is deliberately collapsed to create a more accessible field and greater exposure perioperatively ( 1 , 2 ). As the affected lung collapses, alveolar hypoxia triggers hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction, which redirects pulmonary blood away from the non-ventilated lung. This physiological adaptation enhances the ventilation-perfusion ratio and thereby patients’ oxygenation during single lung ventilation ( 3 ). During thoracic surgery, the hemithorax is opened on the operated side, which allows air to enter the pleural space through the surgical incision, thereby equalizing the thoracic pressure with the atmospheric pressure, and thus creating a “deliberate” pneumothorax ( 4 ). Post-operatively, the anaesthesiologist facilitates the re-expansion of the collapsed lung by reinflation. A chest tube is then routinely placed in the pleural space to restore the negative pressure and prevent the lung from re-collapsing ( 5 , 6 ). In addition to the drainage of air, the placed chest tube also evacuates blood and other pleural fluids. However, chest tube placement is also associated with downsides like discomfort, pain, reduced mobility, increased risk of infection, and an extended length of hospital stay ( 5 ). In recent years, extensive research has been conducted on the use of chest tubes following lung cancer surgery. This review aims to provide an overview of the current understanding of thoracic drainage in the context of lung cancer surgery and to identify potential gaps in current knowledge, as thoracic drainage remains a cornerstone of postoperative recovery.\n\nEvolution of chest drainage systems\n\nThe importance of drains in modern-day surgery has deep historical roots. The development of pleural or thoracic drainage systems has progressed substantially since Hippocrates first introduced the concept of drainage, using hollow tin tubes and reeds to clear empyema (470–370 BC) ( 7 , 8 ). Over the subsequent centuries, very little evolution regarding thoracic drainage systems has been documented. In the 13 th century, thoracic drainage through a wooden tube was described by Von Eschenbach [1170–1220], and in the 18 th century, the French military surgeon Anel [1679–1730] documented chest fluid drainage via aspiration through a syringe with several mouthpieces ( 9 ). In 1771, Birkholz improved Anel’s technique by adding a reservoir, resulting in the creation of the Potain aspirator ( 10 ). Since then, multiple adjustments have been made. In the late 19 th century, the British, German, and French physicians Playfair [1819–1894], Bülau [1835–1900], and Potain [1834–1901], respectively, practically simultaneously introduced the first underwater seal drainage device for the treatment of empyema ( 8 , 11 , 12 ). This was followed by the first use of continuous suction in 1898, described by Heaton ( 13 ).\n\nIn 1922, the American surgeon Lilienthal was a pioneer in the introduction of chest tubes following thoracic surgery, specifically after lobectomy ( 14 ). The widespread adoption of chest tubes was further reinforced by their frequent use during major military conflicts, including World War I, World War II, and the Korean War, and became the established standard of care for major thoracic surgery ( 15 , 16 ). The earliest drainage systems were based on a three-bottle system. Over time, the three-bottle system evolved into the modern-day analogue drainage system ( Figure 1 ), which was first introduced in 1967 by the American company Deknatel, with all three ‘bottles’ combined in a single compact drainage unit ( 6 , 17 , 18 ). Specifically, the chest tube that is placed in the pleural cavity is connected to the first chamber, the collecting chamber, in which all pleural fluids and blood is collected. The second chamber, the water seal chamber, contains a one-way valve that allows air to be drained out of the pleural cavity during exhalation but prevents air from re-entering the pleural cavity during inhalation. The analogue drainage system’s final and third chamber is the suction control chamber, and in most cases, it is not used to apply active suction but to maintain water seal, which has been shown to be sufficient to evacuate air out of the pleural cavity. While the analogue drainage systems are still widely used, their limitations in accurate and continuous monitoring of air leaks led to the introduction of a digital drainage system in the early 2000s, with the Thopaz™ system emerging in 2007 as the first digital and portable drainage system ( Figure 2A,2B ) ( 19 ). In subsequent years, various other digital drainage systems, such as Drentech Redax ( 20 ) and Thoraguard ( 21 ), were introduced to the market, offering comparable solutions. The introduction of digital drainage systems after lung surgery, offering improved precision and real-time data tracking, marked the beginning of a new era.\n\nBest practices for chest tube management\n\nCurrent guidelines on drain management are based on expert recommendations of the Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) Society and European Society of Thoracic Surgeons (ESTS) ( 22 ), as well as consensus statements by the Society of Thoracic Surgeons (STS) ( 23 ). While the expert consensus documents by Batchelor et al. ( 22 ) and Kent et al. ( 23 ) were overall based on limited prospective and randomized trials, some recommendations regarding drain management are strong and evidence-based. For instance, single versus double drain insertion improves postoperative outcomes as evidenced by various randomized studies ( 24 , 25 ) and meta-analyses ( 26 - 28 ), demonstrating no significant differences in reinsertion of chest tubes or pleural effusion, while providing significantly less pain and a shorter drainage duration. Furthermore, chest tube removal criteria, particularly concerning air leakage and fluid production, are well documented. The volume threshold for chest tube removal is discussed extensively in the literature and substantiated by several prospective randomized trials and meta-analyses ( 29 - 40 ). Both guidelines support a volume threshold of ≤450 mL/day for safe drain removal, provided there is no bloody or chylous fluid production ( 24 , 25 ). To date, higher volume thresholds have not been extensively investigated; however, they may also be safe ( 39 ). Nevertheless, recent research has shown that drainage volume, rather than air leakage, is hindering early removal of the chest tube and that air leak alone can be considered a safe criterion for drain removal ( 38 , 41 ).\n\nIn the assessment of air leakage, the objectification differs between digital and analogue drainage systems. In analogue drainage systems, the presence of bubbles in the chamber during coughing, inspiration, and expiration indicates an air leak. In contrast, digital drainage systems provide continuous, real-time air flow (in mL/min) on the display. Chest tube removal is considered safe when the recorded flow ranges between 20 mL/min to 40 mL/min, as low flow within this range can be attributed to the physiological pleural space effect ( 42 ), or in the absence of bubbles in analogue drains ( 43 , 44 ). In terms of the size of the drain, a 19 to 24 French chest drain is considered appropriate after standard lobectomy by the members of the consensus panel of the STS ( 23 ), as there is only a paucity of data available on this topic. Whether it is safe to use a smaller drain (14 French) is being evaluated in an ongoing randomized phase-1 trial ( 45 ). Nevertheless, a large diameter, 28 French or greater, should only be considered in case of extensive intraoperative adhesiolyses or higher risk of postoperative haemorrhage, as a larger drain diameter goes hand in hand with higher patient discomfort and pain.\n\nNonetheless, two key areas warrant a more detailed discussion, as it is unclear whether their use translates into clinically significant benefits: (I) digital versus analogue drainage system, and (II) use of suction versus water seal.\n\nDigital versus analogue drainage system\n\nThe most recent advancement in drainage systems is the digital device, which offers several theoretical benefits over the conventional analogue design. Primarily, the ability to perform real-time and continuous digital monitoring allows for an objective assessment of the possible air-leak trend and fluid production, which may improve interobserver and clinical practice variability, and thereby reduce drainage duration ( 6 , 46 ). Secondly, the digital drainage system is portable and lightweight, allowing early mobilization and rendering it suitable for the outpatient setting ( 47 ). Thirdly, when active suction is required, digital drainage systems do not require wall suction, as analogue systems do, due to internal suction capabilities. As such, the STS concluded that digital drainage systems are at least comparable, in terms of clinical benefits, to conventional analogue systems ( 23 ). Moreover, the ESTS strongly recommends the use of digital drains, although this is based on low-level evidence due to contradictory data ( 22 ).\n\nThe debate between digital versus analogue drainage has been a prominent topic in the last decade. Several studies, including randomized trials, have been conducted with different results. Some studies indicated no significant clinical benefit for digital drain use in terms of prolonged air leak (PAL) ( 48 - 50 ), drain duration, or length of hospital stay ( 50 - 55 ), while others did demonstrate clinically beneficial aspects of digital drainage systems compared to analogue drainage methods for the same outcome measures [i.e., PAL ( 56 ), drain duration, or length of hospital stay ( 57 - 59 )]. It is important to acknowledge though, that a significant amount of heterogeneity exists concerning drain removal criteria among the aforementioned studies (e.g., clamping trials, pleural effusion volume thresholds, and post-operative X-ray assessments), complicating the comparison of clinical outcomes. Furthermore, it is common that research comparing two distinct kinds of treatment modalities is inherently subject to bias, for example, the impossibility of blinding. Hence, well-designed, prospective, randomized (controlled) trials with clear and uniform drain removal criteria are required to standardize the use of digital devices, as patients and healthcare professionals have reported higher satisfaction with digital devices ( 6 , 60 ). Furthermore, a recent retrospective evaluation of patients with a massive postoperative air leak (≥1,000 mL/min) has shown that massive air leakage can be managed with a digital drainage system as safely as a non-massive air leak (101–999 mL/min), without the need for surgery, as often indicated in these cases ( 61 ).\n\nSuction versus water seal\n\nThe rationale behind the use of active suction instead of water seal is generally based on expert opinion and dogma. Nonetheless, the ESTS guidelines strongly recommend against the use of active suction, despite its theoretical role in facilitating pleura-pleural apposition, preventing persistent residual pleural space, aiding in the sealing and drainage of (large) air leaks ( 22 ). The main reason for this recommendation is that, despite conflicting data in the literature, there appears to be no clinical advantage to the application of external suction concerning length of hospital stay, air leak duration, and length of drainage ( 62 - 65 ). The more recent STS guideline established the consensus statement recommending an early transition from active suction to water seal when a traditional analogue drainage system and conventional chest tube are used for pleural drainage. This advice is based on six randomized controlled trials (RCTs) ( 66 - 71 ), three systematic reviews or meta-analyses ( 62 , 63 , 65 ), and two practical guidelines, including the ESTS guideline ( 22 , 64 ). However, no uniform drain management strategy was followed in the supporting RCTs. For example, in two studies, patients were immediately randomized into water seal or active suction ( 66 , 71 ). In two other studies, active suction [−20 cmH 2 O (−2 kPa)] was applied for the first 24 hours, after which a transition to water seal was performed or active suction was continued ( 68 , 70 ). In another study, active suction was maintained from the operating room until arrival at the recovery unit, after which randomization was conducted into suction versus water seal ( 67 ), and in one randomized trial, water seal was immediately applied before randomization into suction versus water seal ( 69 ). Future studies should thus focus on establishing the optimal time frame in which one should transition from active suction to water seal.\n\nDigital drainage systems apply a regulated suction mode that maintains a preset intrapleural pressure and thus do not incorporate a traditional water seal mode. Water seal mode in digital drainage systems, often referred to as gravity drainage mode, is applied through a set pressure between −2 cmH 2 O (−0.2 kPa) and −8 cmH 2 O (−0.8 kPa), corresponding to the physiological variations in intrapleural pressure during inspiration and expiration. This means that in the presence of an air leak, the device will exert active suction, even at very low preset suction levels. Therefore, findings from analogue systems on water seal versus suction cannot be directly extrapolated to digital drainage systems. Three RCTs ( 72 - 74 ) examined different suction levels between −2 cmH 2 O (−0.2 kPa) and −20 cmH 2 O (−2 kPa) in digital drainage systems. Due to inconsistent findings, no definitive recommendations have been established for suction levels in digital drainage systems.\n\nLastly, active suction might play a role in the treatment of large postoperative air leaks. Although there is no clear universal definition of a large air leak, there is some evidence that in case of a large air leak, active suction is required to generate (and restore) negative pressure, thereby promoting the drainage of both fluid and air. Furthermore, the absence of suction in this case has been shown to be associated with an increased risk of pneumonia and arrhythmia ( 70 ).\n\nFuture research directions\n\nDespite the necessity of placing a chest tube after lung surgery procedures, notable drawbacks have also been associated with its use. The presence of a chest tube and post-operative chest pain resulting from the chest tube can significantly impact recovery and mobilisation, leading to a prolonged hospital stay ( 75 ). Early mobilisation is essential for enhancing ventilation, improving respiratory function, and preventing pneumonia ( 76 ). Additionally, it promotes lung re-expansion resulting in the decrease of a collapsed lung and atelectasis. Moreover, mobilisation reduces the risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in patients who are already at high risk of postoperative VTE ( 22 , 77 ). Lastly, prolonged chest tube insertion increases the risk of infections ( 78 ). All these negative aspects highlight the importance of timely removal of the chest tube, in accordance with the multimodal perioperative care pathway ERAS ( 5 , 75 ).\n\nIn addition to early chest tube removal as a means of reducing the concomitant drawbacks and risks of a chest tube, chest tube omission can also be considered in specific cases. In current clinical practice, a chest tube is routinely placed after all anatomical lung resections except pneumonectomy, as the absence of the lung reduces the potential of a pneumothorax or significant air leak ( 79 ). Contrary to anatomical resections, chest tube omission after wedge resections has been extensively examined in multiple studies and continues to be the subject of ongoing research ( 80 ). These studies found that chest tube omission in select patients after wedge resection is safe, with similar complication and reinsertion rates, but shorter hospital stay when compared to patients with chest tubes after wedge resection. Characteristics of these select patients include the absence of pleural adhesions, lung emphysema, and parenchymal defects, as well as negative results on intraoperative air leak assessments, such as the water seal test ( 81 - 83 ).\n\nIn line with omitting chest tubes after wedge resection, several studies have begun to explore the omission of chest tubes after anatomical resections. Initial findings suggest that, in carefully selected patients, the absence of a chest tube does not lead to an increase in complications, such as chest tube re-insertions, pneumonia, atelectasis, and empyema ( 84 , 85 ). However, no RCTs have been conducted yet to validate these findings, and drainless anatomical resections might not be suitable for every patient, as certain patients remain at risk for PAL and/or serious postoperative complications. Therefore, predictive parameters that are crucial to identify those patients should be investigated. Such parameters could be derived from patient characteristics, including the presence of pleural adhesions and lung emphysema, as well as from pre-existing digital drainage data such as airflow and intrapleural pressure at the end of surgery. A recently published scoping review on the use of digital drain data to predict the postoperative drainage course showed that maximum airflow peak, mean air flow, intrapleural pressure, and air leak patterns are all associated with the risk of developing PAL ( 86 ). Furthermore, digital data can objectively provide information on the timing of chest tube removal after an air leak has been discovered ( 87 ). Integrating these digital factors with patient characteristics could facilitate the development of personalized drainage strategies, optimizing postoperative drain management and patient outcomes, and potentially reducing the drainage duration and length of hospital stay.\n\nConclusions\n\nIn conclusion, chest drainage techniques continue to evolve, becoming less invasive with the introduction of ERAS. Standardized definitions for suction, early transition to water seal, and chest tube removal criteria should be established for the entire thoracic surgery section. Once these definitions have been formulated, future research should focus on determining the most optimal postoperative drainage strategy, identifying patients who may benefit from chest tube omission and patients who are prone to developing an air leak following anatomical resections, and creating more evidence-based recommendations and more patient-specific drainage strategies.\n\nSupplementary",
