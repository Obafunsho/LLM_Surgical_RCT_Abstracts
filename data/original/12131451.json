  "abstract": "Background: It is uncertain whether neostigmine reversal improves postoperative pulmonary outcomes. This study aimed to evaluate the association between neostigmine and postoperative atelectasis, and other complications in elderly patients undergoing laparoscopic pancreaticoduodenectomy (LPD).\n\nMethods: This single-center retrospective cohort study included elderly patients who underwent LPD between 2019 and 2022, using cis-atracurium as the sole neuromuscular blocking agent. Participants were divided into two groups based on exposure to neostigmine: the neostigmine reversal group (exposed) and the control group (not exposed). The primary endpoint was the incidence of atelectasis within the first 3 postoperative days. Secondary endpoints included the incidence of pneumonia, pleural effusion, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), time to extubation, length of stay in the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) and hospital, reintubation, postoperative blood gas analysis, 30-day readmission, and 30-day mortality. Propensity score matching (PSM) was performed based on baseline and intraoperative characteristics to minimize potential bias.\n\nResults: Of the 501 patients initially included, 302 were successfully matched after PSM at a 1:5 ratio, comprising 89 patients in the neostigmine reversal group and 213 in the control group. Compared to the control group, the incidence of postoperative atelectasis was lower in the neostigmine reversal group (OR 0.43 [95% CI 0.24–0.75], p = 0.003) in elderly patients undergoing elective LPD. For secondary outcomes, time to extubation (Median [IQR] 20.00 [10.00-32.50] min vs. 25.00 [15.00–41.00] min, p < 0.001), and the length of stay in the PACU (Median [IQR] 55.00 [45.00-67.50] min vs. 60.00 [50.00–84.00] min, p = 0.013) were shortened, and the oxygen index (OI) at 2 h after extubation was increased (Median [IQR] 339.00 (275.76-453.03) vs. 310.00 (262.31–378.00), p < 0.001) in the neostigmine reversal group. Binomial logistic regression showed that age (OR 1.08 [95% CI 1.04–1.12], p < 0.001), neostigmine reversal (OR 0.43 [95% CI 0.24–0.76], p = 0.004), and intraoperative total fluid infusion (OR1.00 [95% CI 1.000-1.001], p = 0.009) were significantly associated with atelectasis after LPD.\n\nConclusions: In this single-center PSM study, neostigmine reversal was associated with lower incidence of atelectasis within the first 3 postoperative days, shorter time to extubation, shorter length of stay in the PACU, and increased OI at 2 h after extubation in elderly patients undergoing elective LPD. Postoperative atelectasis was associated with older age, greater intraoperative total fluid infusion, and the absence of neostigmine reversal. These results should be interpreted as hypothesis-generating, and warrant validation through randomized controlled trials.",

  "full_text": "Introduction\n\nPostoperative residual neuromuscular block (PRNB), with its insidious onset, can cause respiratory complications [ 1 – 5 ]. The incidence of PRNB increases with longer operative times, repeated injections, or continuous infusion of non-depolarizing neuromuscular blocking drugs (NDNMBDs) [ 6 ]. Laparoscopic pancreaticoduodenectomy (LPD) has high morbidity and mortality due to the difficulty and complexity of the procedure and anesthetic management [ 7 ]. Postoperative pulmonary complications (PPCs) caused by prolonged pneumoperitoneum and PRNB are associated with 30-day readmissions and increased mortality [ 2 , 8 ]. Postoperative atelectasis is usually intensified with laparoscopic surgery, especially in elderly patients [ 9 ]. The normal aging process in the lungs increases vulnerability to pulmonary atelectasis during general anesthesia due to the accumulation of cellular damage and senescence [ 10 ]. Therefore, interventions to prevent atelectasis in LPD are attracting the attention of anesthesiologists.\n\nNeostigmine is effective in reversing shallow and moderate non-depolarizing neuromuscular blockade [ 11 ] by inhibiting acetylcholinesterase and increasing the amount of acetylcholine in the neuromuscular junction [ 12 ]. It is the most commonly used reversal agent because cis-atracurium is widely used in many centers and the use of sugammadex is often restricted by hospital policies. However, due to the nicotinic and muscarinic (bronchial constriction, abdominal cramping and nausea) side effects induced by neostigmine [ 13 ], many anesthesiologists are reluctant to use it. Reversal of neuromuscular block remains controversial. Spontaneous reversal of NDNMBDs without neostigmine is still the mainstream approach in current China.\n\nTo summarize the experiences and guide clinical practice, we conducted this retrospective propensity score matched (PSM) study to investigate the association between neostigmine reversal and the incidence of postoperative atelectasis, as well as other postoperative outcomes in elderly patients undergoing elective LPD. The primary outcome was the incidence of atelectasis within the first 3 postoperative days. Secondary outcomes included the incidence of other PPCs, time to extubation, the length of stay in the PACU and hospital after surgery, arterial blood gas values at 2 h after extubation, reintubation, 30-day readmission, and 30-day mortality.\n\nMethods\n\nThis study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Zhejiang Provincial People’s Hospital (number: [2022]285). Considering the retrospective cohort design, informed consent was waived. This study was designed and reported using the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) guidelines.\n\nData collection\n\nData were extracted from the electronic medical records of patients at Zhejiang Provincial People’ s Hospital, encompassing demographic information, anesthesia records, laboratory findings, diagnoses, etc. Data collection spanned from January 2019 to December 2022. Zhejiang Provincial People’ s Hospital is a multidisciplinary, tertiary care facility and teaching affiliate at Hangzhou Medical College in Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China. As a high-volume pancreatic surgical center, the surgical team is experienced in open and laparoscopic surgery.\n\nPatient inclusion and exclusion criteria\n\nThis study included elderly patients (aged 65 years and older) who underwent elective LPD under general anesthesia and received cis-atracurium during surgery. The exclusion criteria were as follows: (1) patients classified as American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) Grade > III; (2) patients with intensive care unit (ICU) admission at the end of surgery; (3) patients using other reversal agents except for neostigmine; (4) patients with missing information on neostigmine dosage; (5) patients with pre-existing atelectasis confirmed by imaging tests prior to surgery; (6) patients with missing information for postoperative imaging tests to assess PPCs. Missing information were rare and assumed to be completely random. A complete-case analysis was thus performed, excluding only cases with missing variables of interest.\n\nExposure variable\n\nThe exposure variable in this study was the administration of neostigmine for reversal (NEO group), regardless of dosage, while the control variable was the absence of neostigmine administration for reversal (Control group). Intraoperative anesthetic management was managed by attending anesthesiologists with more than five years of work experience. PNRB was evaluated based on clinical subjective criteria, including eyes open and head up maintenance for 5 s, leg lift, and tongue protrusion test. Decisions of neostigmine administration and dosage was left to the same attending anesthesiologist in the PACU. In our institutional guidelines, the dosage of neostigmine is 1–2 mg, along with the use of atropine as appropriate depending on the heart rate level. The intermittent bolus dose of cis-atracurium is 0.03–0.05 mg kg − 1 . Patients were allowed to regain spontaneous breathing without neostigmine reversal and then be extubated if the last dose of cis-atracurium was administered at 30 min or more before the end of surgery.\n\nConfounding variables\n\nWe considered a range of variables that could potentially influence the development of postoperative atelectasis. Baseline characteristics included age, sex, body mass index (BMI), ASA classification, and comorbidities (such as hypertension, diabetes, cardiac disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease). Preoperative laboratory variables included hemoglobin (Hb), hematocrit (Hct), and oxygen index (OI). The most recent preoperative laboratory values were used as the baseline data. Anesthesia-related variables comprised intraoperative total fluid infusion, and dosage of cis-atracurium. Surgical variables included surgical duration and estimated blood loss.\n\nOutcomes\n\nThe primary outcome was the incidence of atelectasis within the first 3 postoperative days, diagnosed based on the chest imaging findings and confirmed by radiologists. Secondary outcomes included the incidence of other PPCs (pneumonia, pleural effusion, and ARDS), time to extubation, the length of stay in the PACU and hospital after surgery, arterial blood gas values at 2 h after extubation, the incidence of reintubation, 30-day readmission, and 30-day mortality. Given the nature of major abdominal surgery, arterial blood gas sampling was performed for each patient via single arterial puncture by ward nurses preoperatively and at 2 h post-extubation using disposable arterial blood collection kits. All patients received standardized postoperative oxygen therapy via nasal cannula at approximately 3 L/min during ward transfer and continued for the first 24 h postoperatively unless clinically contraindicated. Ward nurses documented the exact oxygen flow rate immediately before sampling. Fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO₂) was calculated: FiO₂ = 21% + (4% × oxygen flow rate in L/min). Additionally, a computed tomography (CT) scan of the lungs was conducted prior to the surgery and within 3 days after surgery. Postoperative complications were identified through review of medical records and CT images, specifically for the diagnosis of PPCs. Postoperative oxygenation status was assessed using the oxygenation index (OI), which was defined as the ratio of arterial oxygen partial pressure to the FiO₂. An OI of less than 200 is indicative of ARDS.\n\nStatistical analysis\n\nGiven the inherent selection bias in non-randomized studies, we used PSM to minimize potential bias in our analysis [ 14 ]. The covariates of patient characteristics, preoperative information and operative characteristics were matched at a 1:5 ratio with a 0.03 caliper by the nearest neighbor method. To determine the balance between the two groups before and after PSM, absolute standardized difference (ASD) was used; an ASD < 0.1 for the covariates indicated that the two groups were sufficiently balanced.\n\nNormality was assessed using Shapiro-Wilk analysis. Categorical and continuous variables were compared using Chi-square tests and Student’s t-tests (normally distributed) or Fisher’s exact test and Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney U-test (non-normally distributed), respectively. Normally distributed continuous variables are expressed as mean (SD), nonnormally distributed variables as median (IQR), and categorical variables as frequency (percentage).\n\nIn order to determine the independent factors of atelectasis in elderly patients with LPD, a univariate analysis was performed, and variables with P values of < 0.1 were entered into multivariate logistic regression using the forward stepwise conditional method.\n\nThe package matchit of the R program (version 4.4.1; www.r-project.org ) was used as a PSM tool; the analysis was performed with SPSS software version 26 (IBM, Armonk, NY). A two-tailed P -value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. The 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated.\n\nResults\n\nDuring the study period, there were 792 adult patients undergoing elective LPD under general anesthesia. After eliminating patients with missing core data elements and applying aforementioned inclusion and exclusion criteria, 501 patients were included in our analysis (Fig. 1 ). Postoperative atelectasis occurred in 114 patients (22.75%) (Table 1 ). The mean (SD) neostigmine dose was 1.53 (0.50) mg.\n\nTable 2 shows the covariate comparison between NEO group and Control group before and after PSM. There is a difference between the intended matching ratio (1:5) and the actual matching ratio (approximately 1:2.4) because the matching algorithm was set to the nearest neighbor method with a 0.03 caliper. After PSM, covariates were well-balanced with an ASD < 0.1 except for ASA level.\n\nTable 3 presents the primary and secondary outcomes of this study. Neostigmine reversal was associated with a lower incidence of atelectasis (OR 0.43 [95% CI 0.25–0.75], p = 0.003) in elderly patients undergoing elective LPD. For secondary outcomes, patients in the NEO group had significantly shorter time to extubation (Median [IQR] 20.00 [10.00-32.50] min vs. 25.00 [15.00–41.00] min, p < 0.001), length of stay in the PACU (Median [IQR] 55.00 [45.00-67.50] min vs. 60.00 [50.00–84.00] min, p = 0.013), and higher OI at 2 h after extubation (Median [IQR] 339.00 [275.76-453.03] vs. 310.00 [262.31–378.00], p = 0.001) compared to the control group. The incidence of other PPCs including pneumonia, pleural effusion, and ARDS, PaO2 and PaCO2 at 2 h after extubation, the length of stay in the hospital after surgery, the incidence of reintubation, 30-day readmission, and 30-day mortality did not differ between the groups.\n\nIn order to explore the independent risk factors of postoperative atelectasis, binomial logistic regression was used. The results showed that age (OR 1.08 [95% CI 1.04–1.12], p < 0.001), neostigmine reversal (OR 0.43 [95% CI 0.24–0.76], p = 0.004), and intraoperative total fluid infusion (OR1.00 [95% CI 1.000-1.001], p = 0.009) were significantly associated with atelectasis after LPD (Fig. 2 ).\n\nDiscussion\n\nThe results of this study showed that neostigmine reversal was associated with a lower incidence of postoperative atelectasis within the first 3 postoperative days, shorter time to extubation, shorter length of stay in the PACU, and higher OI at 2 h after extubation compared to the control group in elderly patients undergoing elective LPD. Postoperative atelectasis was associated with older age, greater intraoperative total fluid infusion, and the absence of neostigmine reversal.\n\nPrevious studies have reported that cis-atracurium was associated with a higher incidence of PRNB compared to rocuronium, despite its favorable pharmacokinetic profile and organ-independent elimination [ 15 ]. Regrettably, quantifying the degree of postoperative neuromuscular transmission in the PACU following cis-atracurium administration was not a routine procedure, and the incidence of PRNB was not well-documented in the literature [ 4 ]. While several recent studies strongly recommend quantitative neuromuscular monitoring (NMT) to guide reversal and extubation decisions [ 16 – 18 ], our study reflects the reality of many resource-limited settings where such monitoring remains unavailable and underscore the need for NMT equipment investment. The respiratory impairment induced by residual neuromuscular block can have long-term consequences. A retrospective study of 11,355 patients showed that the use of NDNMBDs without neostigmine reversal was associated with increased incidence of PPCs, and the incidence of 30-day postoperative mortality was also significantly increased [ 2 ], therefore, the authors recommend that reversal of NDNMBDs should become a standard practice if extubation is planned. In our study, neostigmine reversal was found to be associated with lower incidence of atelectasis, which was in line with previous findings [ 2 , 15 ]. Regarding PACU data, neostigmine reversal group showed 5 min shorter time to extubation and length of stay in the PACU compared to no reversal group. While the absolute 5-minute difference may appear modest, in our high-volume center performing > 500 major pancreatic surgeries annually, this time could enhance PACU throughput, improve patient comfort by reducing prolonged awakening-related distress, and optimize resource utilization. Furthermore, the OI at 2 h after extubation was higher in the NEO group, and 30-day readmission and 30-day mortality did not differ between the two groups.\n\nHowever, some studies have shown inconsistent results regarding the association between neostigmine reversal and PPCs. Sasaki et al. [ 19 ] found that high-dose neostigmine (> 60 µg kg − 1 ) was associated with longer postoperative length of stay in the hospital. Additionally, post hoc analysis indicated that high-dose neostigmine or unwarranted use of neostigmine may contribute to increased postoperative respiratory morbidity. A prospective PSM cohort study found that reversal with neostigmine even increased the risk of severe postoperative respiratory failure [ 20 ]. These inconsistent findings may be due to the following factors: differences in surgery and anesthetic agents, neostigmine dosage, patients’ underlying pathologic conditions. Neostigmine dose-dependently affects respiratory muscle function and increases upper airway collapsibility [ 21 , 22 ]. The molecular mechanisms underlying these effects include desensitization of acetylcholine receptors, depolarization block of neuromuscular transmission, and an open channel block of acetylcholine receptors leading to rapid closure [ 23 , 24 ]. In our center, the intermittent bolus dose of cis-atracurium was relatively small (0.03–0.05 mg kg − 1 ), the dosage of neostigmine in our study was less than 40 µg kg − 1 , and the timing of neostigmine administration was after the patients regained spontaneous breathing. These approaches may have enhanced the beneficial effects of neostigmine. To address the contradiction between neostigmine administration and its potential adverse effects, Thilen et al. [ 25 ] proposed a protocol outlining appropriate dosing and optimal timing for neostigmine reversal, which was shown to significantly reduce the incidence of severe PRNB.\n\nIn addition, older age was associated with a higher incidence of atelectasis according to our results, a finding consistent with Hochhegger et al. [ 9 ]. Elderly patients are at a higher risk of perioperative respiratory complications due to poorer overall health and multiple underlying comorbidities. However, Hedenstierna et al. [ 26 ] have reported inconsistent findings regarding the relationship between age and atelectasis formation. They found atelectasis during general anesthesia increased with age up to 50 year but decreased thereafter, indicating that older age appeared to limit atelectasis formation during general anesthesia. A possible explanation for the discrepancy in the association between age and atelectasis in the two studies is the difference in the timing of imaging assessments. In the study by Hedenstierna et al. [ 26 ], patients underwent CT scans both while awake and during anesthesia before surgery, whereas in our study, imaging tests were performed within the first 3 days after surgery.\n\nIntraoperative fluid infusion volume also has a significant effect on postoperative atelectasis. For patients at higher risk of complications, restrictive intraoperative fluid administration combined with individualized goal-directed fluid therapy based on cardiac output and stroke volume is considered to be better intraoperative fluid management to avoid volume overload, and these strategies have been supported in many studies [ 27 , 28 ].\n\nThis study has a few limitations. First, the retrospective cohort study design may lead to selection bias, and data quality or accuracy may be compromised compared to a prospective study. For example, the decision to administer neostigmine was based on the PACU anesthesiologist’s clinical judgment rather than a standardized protocol. This practice variability, while reflective of real-world settings, could introduce selection bias despite our PSM adjustments for known confounders. In addition, we did not systematically capture data on anesthetic depth monitoring which may influence PRNB and extubation criteria, its confounding effect on the neostigmine-atelectasis relationship also remains uncertain. Second, as a single-center study, our findings may have limited generalizability to broader clinical practice. Further prospective research is needed to explore the causal relationship between neostigmine reversal and atelectasis after LPD. Third, the proportion of patients with neostigmine reversal was relatively low, and a large number of samples were excluded during PSM. Furthermore, we only included patients who received cis-atracurium during surgery, as rocuronium was rarely used in our center during the study period. This may limit the generalizability of our findings to other NDNMBDs. Finally, PNRB was evaluated based on clinical subjective criteria, therefore, the lack of NMT may limit the ability to confirm adequate recovery prior to extubation.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn this single-center PSM study, neostigmine reversal was associated with a lower incidence of postoperative atelectasis within the first 3 postoperative days, shorter time to extubation, shorter length of stay in the PACU, and higher OI at 2 h after extubation in elderly patients undergoing elective LPD. Postoperative atelectasis was associated with older age, greater intraoperative total fluid infusion, and the absence of neostigmine reversal. These results should be interpreted as hypothesis-generating, and warrant validation through randomized controlled trials.",
