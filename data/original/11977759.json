  "abstract": "Background: Lugol solution is often administered to patients with Graves’ disease before surgery. The aim is to reduce thyroid vascularization and surgical morbidity, but its real effectiveness remains controversial. The present study was designed to evaluate the effects of preoperative Lugol solution on thyroid vascularization and surgical morbidity in patients with Graves’ disease undergoing total thyroidectomy.\n\nMethods: Fifty-six patients undergoing total thyroidectomy for Graves’ disease were randomly assigned to receive 7 days of Lugol treatment (Lugol+ group, 29) or no Lugol treatment (LS– group, 27) before surgery in this single-centre and single-blinded trial. Preoperative hormone and colour Doppler ultrasonographic data for assessing thyroid vascularization were collected 8 days before surgery (T0) and on the day of surgery (T1). The primary outcome was intraoperative and postoperative blood loss. Secondary outcomes included duration of surgery, thyroid function, morbidity, vascularization, and microvessel density at final pathology.\n\nResults: No differences in demographic, preoperative hormone or ultrasonographic data were found between LS+ and LS– groups at T0. At T1, free tri-iodothyronine (FT3) and free thyroxine (FT4) levels were significantly reduced compared with T0 values in the LS+ group, whereas no such variation was observed in the LS– group. No differences between T0 and T1 were found for ultrasonographic vascularization in either group, nor did the histological findings differ. There were no significant differences between the LS+ and LS– groups concerning intraoperative/postoperative blood loss (median 80 versus 94 ml respectively), duration of surgery (75 min in both groups) or postoperative morbidity.\n\nConclusion: Lugol solution significantly reduces FT3 and FT4 levels in patients undergoing surgery for Graves’ disease, but does not decrease intraoperative/postoperative blood loss, thyroid vascularization, duration of surgery or postoperative morbidity.\n\nRegistration number: NCT05784792 ( https://www.clinicaltrials.gov ).",

Medical treatment is the most frequently used therapy, but total thyroidectomy may offer definitive treatment in patients with refractory disease 1 . As an alternative to radioiodine administration, surgery offers important advantages, such as a low recurrence rate and rapid resolution of hyperthyroidism, but its use has been hampered by fear of postoperative complications, which occur with an overall incidence rate of 30–40% 1 .\n\nAdequate preoperative preparation of the patient is usually considered crucial to avoid the severe thyrotoxicosis resulting from intraoperative leakage of thyroid hormone into the circulation. This is also important to decrease surgical morbidity such as neck haematoma, hypoparathyroidism, and vocal cord paresis. In fact, increased complication rates after thyroidectomy for GD are usually reported. This is possibly because of hyperthyroidism-related hypervascularization 2 causing intraoperative bleeding, with subsequent reduced visualization and preservation of parathyroid glands and laryngeal nerves 3 , 4 .\n\nFor this purpose, saturated potassium or sodium iodide solution or Lugol’s iodine–iodide solution (LS) has traditionally been administered since the 1920s before surgery as an antithyroid drug 5 . LS was first described in 1829 as a brown-coloured galenic solution with a characteristic bitter taste. Its use in the preoperative preparation of patients with GD was proposed by Plummer in 1923, to reduce intraoperative bleeding and prevent the perioperative thyroid storm due to the massive release of thyroid hormones during surgery 1 , 4 . International guidelines 6 , 7 suggest that hyperthyroidism should be adequately controlled by antithyroid drugs before surgery, and also by using LS in the immediate preoperative period to decrease thyroid vascularity and intraoperative blood loss.\n\nAlthough this practice is widespread, there is still no agreement on the real effectiveness of LS. The main reason for this lack of consensus stems from the variety of treatment protocols in terms of drug dose and concurrent management of antithyroid therapy 5 . Moreover, most studies related to the effects of LS are based on indirect, subjective, and controversial evaluations 2 , 5 .\n\nVariables that can be measured objectively may, however, be employed to assess the effect of LS on thyroid vascularization. Colour Doppler ultrasonography can be used to assess the degree of thyroid vascularization 2 . Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) induces angiogenesis and has been identified in the thyroid gland, with high levels reported in patients with GD 1 . Neoangiogenesis, defined as the development of new blood vessels, has also been reported in GD, and can be assessed by the measurement of microvessel density (MVD), that is by counting vessels labelled by immunohistochemistry 5 .\n\nThe aim of the present prospective randomized trial was to evaluate the impact of preoperative short-term LS treatment on biochemical, clinical, ultrasonographic, pathological, and surgical outcomes, according to both objective and subjective variables, in patients undergoing total thyroidectomy for GD.\n\nMethods\n\nDesign and randomization\n\nThe present randomized, prospective, single-centre, single-blinded study focused on patients undergoing total thyroidectomy for GD at the Endocrine Surgery Unit, Padua University Hospital, Italy, between February 2020 and April 2023.\n\nGD was defined as biochemical hyperthyroidism (raised free thyroid hormone concentrations, undetectable or reduced levels of thyrotropin (TSH) at disease onset, with high levels of serum thyroid antibodies against TSH receptor), with diffuse non-nodular increased vascularization on thyroid ultrasound imaging and/or diffuse uptake of the radioisotope at scintigraphy 8 .\n\nThe indications for surgical treatment were recurrent or persistent disease after antithyroid treatment withdrawal, presence of large symptomatic goitre, severe Graves’ ophthalmopathy, and patient preference. All patients underwent routine preoperative treatment, including receipt of methimazole or propylthiouracil aiming to counteract the effect of hyperthyroidism and possibly achieve euthyroidism 9 .\n\nTotal thyroidectomy via cervicotomy under general anaesthesia was performed by a single experienced surgeon with the same surgical team and a standardized technique 10 . Haemostasis was achieved with ligatures, titanium clips, bipolar and monopolar coagulation, and ultrasonic shears. A closed suction drain with negative pressure was placed in all patients for 24 h.\n\nPatients were randomized in the outpatient setting when surgical treatment was proposed. At that time, patients were informed about the possibility of participating in the trial and randomized in the case of acceptance. Randomization was performed through an online software application (Sealed Envelope TM ) 11 and patients were assigned to receipt of LS before surgery (Lugol+ group) and no LS (Lugol− group).\n\nLS was administered at baseline as 10 drops orally 3 times a day for 7 days, starting 8 days before surgery (T0), for a total of 10.5 ml containing 1.68 g iodine, up to the day of surgery (T1). An unblinded member of the investigator team supervised the randomization process, noted the presence of adverse events, verified the correct LS intake, and registered outcomes. All remaining investigators, including radiologists, pathologists, and members of the operating team, were blinded to the patient allocation.\n\nExclusion criteria were: age less than 18 or over 70 years; previous thyroid or parathyroid surgery; concurrent hyperparathyroidism; thyroid malignancies (as assessed or suspected by fine-needle aspiration); isolated or multiple hypofixing or hyperfixing nodules; iodine allergy; pregnancy or breastfeeding; preoperative vocal cord palsy; calcium or active vitamin D analogue medication; antiplatelet or anticoagulant medication, or affected by disorders of haemostasis; and inability to understand the nature of the study or disagreement with trial participation. Patients enrolled in the Lugol+ group who discontinued LS treatment at the given dose and timing were excluded at T1 immediately before measuring biochemical, ultrasonographic, and surgical outcomes.\n\nThis study was designed in accordance with the provisions of the Helsinki Declaration, approved by the local institutional review board (registration code UPd39962) and registered at https://www.clinicaltrials.gov ( NCT05784792 ). It is reported in line with the CONSORT (Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trilas) statement 12 ( Fig. 1 ).\n\nOutcomes\n\nSurgical outcomes\n\nThe primary outcome was the evaluation of intraoperative and postoperative blood loss. This was measured directly for each patient as the volume of blood aspirated and absorbed by gauzes during surgery (volume calculated from the difference between dry gauzes and weight of soaked gauzes) and drained after operation by the suction bottle. Blood loss was also measured indirectly by the number of surgical suture threads and haemostatic clips used to ligate vascular structures during the surgical procedure. Moreover, intraoperative bleeding was also evaluated subjectively by two senior surgeons performing the surgical procedure, with a score ranging from 0 to 5 (from the least to the most bloody surgical procedure).\n\nSecondary outcomes evaluated were postoperative laryngeal nerve palsy, neck haematomas, postoperative hypocalcaemia and hypoparathyroidism, and duration of surgery (defined as time between skin incision and closure).\n\nLaryngeal motility was assessed before and after surgery in all patients by indirect laryngoscopy and/or laryngeal ultrasonography. Serum total calcium (corrected according to the value of serum albumin), ionized serum calcium, and parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels were assessed at baseline (T0) and on the day after operation. Postoperative hypoparathyroidism was defined by PTH values of 10 pg/ml or less, leading to hypocalcaemia, and the need for calcium and active vitamin D analogue supplementation 13 . The impact of thyroidectomy on parathyroid identification and preservation was also assessed according to the number of parathyroid glands remaining in situ (PGRIS). PGRIS was calculated as follows: 4 – (glands autografted + glands in surgical specimen) 14 .\n\nBiochemical outcomes\n\nTSH, free tri-iodothyronine (FT3), free thyroxine (FT4), and VEGF levels were measured before surgery in both groups at baseline (T0, corresponding to the time of initiation of LS administration in the Lugol+ group), and 8 days later (at T1, corresponding to the day of surgery; the day after withdrawal of LS administration in the Lugol+ group).\n\nUltrasonographic outcomes\n\nThyroid vascularity and volume were assessed by colour Doppler ultrasound examination, with a 2–14-MHz high-frequency wideband linear transducer (RS85; Samsung Medison, Seoul, South Korea). Each examination was performed by a single experienced radiologist blinded in terms of the LS allocation and laboratory values at T0 and T1. The superior and inferior thyroid arteries on each side of the neck were located first with colour Doppler followed by pulsed-wave Doppler analysis. An automatic trace of the velocity profile in the vessels was acquired by the ultrasonographic scan, and the peak systolic (Vmax), end-diastolic (Vmin), and mean (Vmean) velocities were measured. From these data, the resistive index (RI) and pulsatility index (PI) of the four main thyroid arteries, sampled near their entrance into the gland, were calculated. The formula for RI was (Vmax – Vmin)/Vmax and that for PI was (Vmax − Vmin)/Vmean.\n\nA mean thyroid RI rate was calculated from four measurements for each artery; the mean values for the four-thyroid-artery velocity, PI, and RI were then calculated 4 , 5 . Thyroid volume was calculated as the sum of right and left thyroid lobe volume (ml) and each lobe volume derived from the following formula: anteroposterior diameter (mm) × longitudinal diameter (mm) × laterolateral diameter (mm) × 0.522 5 .\n\nPathological outcomes\n\nThyroid surgical specimens underwent routine histopathological examination. Tissue slides were stained using an endothelial cell marker (CD31 antibody) by immunohistochemistry in order to assess possible modification of thyroid vascularity. A Z-Stack scanner (Hamamatsu ® Z-Stack scanner, Iwata City, Shizuoka, Japan) was used to capture the entire set of slides and save them as digital three-dimensional images. Digital images were analysed using machine-learning algorithm software (Visiopharm ® , Hørsholm, Denmark) to assist with tasks including the identification of separate vascular structures on sampled Roe areas 15 . Finally, vessels were counted, and MVD calculated as the mean value of three areas of 1 mm 2 with different tissue features (more colloid, more folliculi, mixed area). CD31-positive individual endothelial cells or endothelial cell clusters that were clearly separate from adjacent follicular epithelial cells and other connective tissue elements were regarded as capillaries, even in the absence of lumen. Vessel counts were assessed by a single experienced pathologist who was unaware of any clinical data and patient randomization ( Fig. 2 ).\n\nStatistical analysis\n\nThe sample size calculation was based on the limited data published on this subject 5 . Assuming a reduction of 40% in perioperative blood loss in patients undergoing total thyroidectomy for GD with LS preparation, an α error of 0.05 and a β error of 0.05, it was calculated that a minimum of 52 patients would be needed (26 in each arm).\n\nBaseline patient characteristics were evaluated using Fisher’s test for sex differences, Student’s t test for age, thyroid function (FT3, FT4, TSH), VEGF levels, and parathyroid function (preoperative serum ionized and total albumin-corrected calcium, phosphate, and PTH levels). Intraoperative and postoperative blood loss, use of haemostatic clips and surgical threads, duration of surgery, thyroid weight, postoperative levels of calcium, phosphorus, and PTH, and histology data (MVD and vessel count) were compared by means of the t test and Mann–Whitney U test, as appropriate. The χ 2 test was used to establish differences in surgical bleeding and PGRIS scores. Paired Student’s t test was used for analysis of normally distributed variables and Wilcoxon’s test for variables with a skewed distribution to detect differences between T0 and T1 in Lugol+ and Lugol− groups, in terms of thyroid hormones and ultrasonographic data. Pearson’s correlation analysis was used to calculate the strength and direction of the relationship between the subjective surgeons’ bleeding score and objective methods used to measure intraoperative and postoperative blood loss. P < 0.050 was considered statistically significant.\n\nResults\n\nA total of 116 patients were screened, and 46 were excluded because they did not fulfil the inclusion criteria. Seventy patients were randomized into the Lugol+ and Lugol− groups. Fourteen patients were subsequently excluded from the Lugol+ group at T1 after randomization because of withdrawal or discontinuation of LS, and the outcome variables were no longer registered. Inclusion of patients who violated the protocol for LS administration in the Lugol+ group might have confounded the measurements of postoperative biochemical, ultrasonographic, and surgical outcomes. Thus, the analysis focused on the remining 56 patients, 29 in the Lugol+ group and 27 in the Lugol− group ( Fig. 1 ); a per-protocol analysis was used instead of intention-to-treat analysis.\n\nDemographic and baseline characteristics of the total population, and Lugol+ and Lugol− groups, at enrolment (T0) are shown in Table 1 .\n\nNo severe adverse events owing to LS administration were reported. However, 35 patients complained about an uncomfortable metallic taste after LS consumption and 15 reported difficulties in obtaining the LS galenic preparation from the pharmacy.\n\nThere were no deaths, neck haematomas, reoperations, hospital readmissions or vocal cord paralysis. Postoperative hypoparathyroidism was documented in twelve patients (21%). Histopathology confirmed GD in all patients; a papillary microcarcinoma was also detected incidentally in six patients.\n\nSurgical outcomes\n\nNo differences were reported between Lugol+ and Lugol− groups concerning the primary outcome of intraoperative and postoperative blood loss, number of suture threads and clips used, mean bleeding score, and duration of surgery ( Table 2 ). The thyroid weight was also comparable. The mean surgeon-estimated bleeding score correlated positively with the volume of intraoperative and postoperative blood loss ( R = 0.356, P = 0.008), and the number of clips ( R = 0.405, P = 0.002) and threads ( R = 0.392, P = 0.015) used.\n\nThere were no differences in postoperative serum total and ionized calcium, phosphorus, and PTH levels between the two groups. Hypoparathyroidism occurred in 5 out of 29 and 7 out of 27 patients in Lugol+ and Lugol− groups, respectively, with no significant difference ( Table 2 ).\n\nHistopathological outcomes\n\nNo significant differences were found between Lugol+ and Lugol− groups in MVD and vessel count ( Table 2 ). This finding was demonstrated in a very precise and objective way. The Z-Stack scanner represents a recent deep learning model that provides the possibility of capturing latent features from haematoxylin and eosin and immunohistochemical images, and achieving reasonably accurate clinical prediction. This approach is a challenging data-efficient model that is capable of learning from smaller training samples and still maintains high prediction accuracy. For this purpose, digital image analysis based on machine learning algorithms was used to allow the pathologist to have a three-dimensional number of vascular structures evidenced after immunostaining for CD31, thus excluding bias related to the possibility of counting the same vessels in different sections ( Fig. 2 ).\n\nEffect of Lugol solution on biochemical and ultrasonographic outcomes\n\nA significant decrease in FT3 and FT4 concentrations between T0 and T1 was observed in the Lugol+ group ( P = 0.021 and P = 0.002 respectively), whereas there was no variation in TSH and VEGF levels ( Table 3 ). No significant differences for these variables were found between T0 and T1 in the Lugol− group ( Table S1 ). There were no differences between T0 and T1 in either group for all ultrasonographically measured variables (thyroid volume, thyroid artery blood velocity, PI, and RI).\n\nDiscussion\n\nTotal thyroidectomy represents the definitive treatment for refractory GD after failure of medical treatments, but is considered a challenging procedure, with increased morbidity, mainly owing to gland hypervascularization, tissue fragility, and a tendency for intraoperative bleeding. As a consequence, the identification and preservation of parathyroid glands and laryngeal nerves in patients with GD may be challenging, even for experienced surgeons 3 , 4 .\n\nFor these reasons, international guidelines 6 , 7 suggest adequate preparation for surgery with antithyroid drugs, with the aim of achieving euthyroidism and reducing thyroid vascularization. Thus, short-term LS administration is traditionally undertaken in addition to long-term treatment with antithyroid drugs before surgery in patients with GD. LS contains a high concentration of iodine, which inhibits thyroid secretion and thyroxine and tri-iodothyronine synthesis, the latter by blocking thyroperoxidase by the Wolff–Chaikoff effect. These effects have rapid onset 7 , 8 .\n\nThere are, however, several limitations to LS administration. It is usually available as a galenic drug and is not ubiquitously available in all pharmacies. LS has a disagreeable taste with gastrointestinal side-effects, potentially leading to reduced patient compliance. The present study confirmed these findings. Trouble with LS availability was reported by 35% of patients and a disagreeable taste by 81%. Moreover, 32% of patients discontinued the treatment because of negative gastrointestinal side-effects or the organoleptic characteristic of the galenic solution. These patients were excluded from the analysis because the trial aimed to evaluate the effect of LS on early postoperative outcomes, and LS tolerability was not predicted before the randomization process.\n\nLS effects are transient, owing to physiological diminution of the Wolff–Chaikoff effect within a few weeks after blockage, with subsequent escape and paradoxical worsening of thyroid hypersecretion 2 , 16 , 17 . Moreover, the dose and duration of preoperative LS administration varies widely 18 , and there is still no agreement on its real effectiveness in reducing thyroid vascularization, intraoperative bleeding, and postoperative morbidity.\n\nContrasting results have been reported in literature 2 , 7 . Some recent studies have shown a possible impact in reducing thyroid vascularization and surgical morbidity. Huang et al. 1 reported that 10 days of preoperative treatment with LS achieved a significant reduction (55%) in VEGF levels and ultrasonographic thyroid blood flow (60%) in a series of 25 patients. In that retrospective study, however, it was not mentioned how these modifications could improve surgical outcomes for patients with GD, and whether some of the baseline patient characteristics could have been related to these effects.\n\nErbil et al. 5 reported that LS treatment before total thyroidectomy for GD achieved a significant reduction in intrathyroid MVD on immunohistochemistry, ultrasonographic blood flow, and blood loss in a comparative series including 36 patients. Median blood loss (50 versus 140 ml) and duration of operation (138 versus 150 min) were significantly lower in patients receiving LS compared with controls. The controls had a 9.33-fold increased rate of intraoperative blood loss.\n\nOn the other hand, other studies have demonstrated no reduction in blood loss, duration of surgical procedure 16 , 18 , postoperative complications, and duration of hospital stay after preoperative LS preparation 19 , 20 . It is important to note that all these series were retrospective and sometimes multicentre studies, and at risk of bias.\n\nFor these reasons, the present study was designed as a prospective single-centre RCT to obtain comparable groups and reduce confounding factors. To further reduce any possible bias, all surgical procedures, and ultrasonographic and pathological examinations were each undertaken by a single operator. These were all blinded to the randomization and patient characteristics.\n\nAs expected, the present study confirmed that preoperative LS administration can significantly reduce FT3 and FT4 levels, according to the Wolff–Chaikoff effect, and achieve euthyroidism. LS had no effects on intraoperative and postoperative blood loss, as demonstrated by very precise assessment that also included blood loss absorbed by gauzes during the surgical procedure. This might even be the main source of blood loss during thyroidectomy and is usually not measured. This finding was also confirmed by a subjective semiquantitative score assigned by the surgeons performing the thyroidectomy. They were blinded to the randomization and LS administration, and found no significant differences in bleeding between the two groups. Interestingly, this subjective semiquantitative score directly correlated with some objectively measured variables assessing perioperative bleeding. Finally, the absence of differences in bleeding was also confirmed indirectly by the duration of surgery and the use of haemostatic devices (number of clips and suture threads).\n\nDifferences in findings in the present trial compared with previous similar ones 1 , 5 could also have been due to different surgical techniques, different LS administration protocols (7 instead of 10 days), and different patient populations. For example, in the present series, the mean duration of operation in both Lugol+ and Lugol− groups was significantly shorter (75 versus 138 min and 75 versus 150 min) and the mean blood loss reported was lower (89 versus 108.7 ml and 89 versus 128 ml) than reported by Erbil et al. 5 .\n\nIn contrast to previous similar literature, the present study did not show any substantial significant variations in thyroid vascularity parameters after 7 days of LS intake, as evident from ultrasonographic, biochemical, and histopathological data. In fact, thyroid volume, PI, RI, and blood flow as calculated at ultrasonography, and VEGF levels did not differ at T1 in either Lugol+ or Lugol− groups. Furthermore, LS had no effect on gland vascularity as assessed by histopathological evaluation according to MVD and vessel count, in contrast with previous studies 2 , 5 . It can be argued that short-term LS uptake cannot have any significant effects on the structural vascular pattern in thyroid tissue.\n\nAlthough the present study was designed mainly to assess the effects of LS on intraoperative and postoperative blood loss, the findings also seem to suggest no significant effects on other surgical morbidities. There were no vocal cord palsies, neck haematomas, reoperations or hospital readmissions in either group. Even parathyroid morbidity was similar, as assessed directly by both total, ionized calcium, and PTH levels. The rate of hypoparathyroidism was thus not significantly reduced by LS administration before surgery. Hypoparathyroidism represents the most frequent morbidity in thyroid surgery, and total thyroidectomy for GD is usually considered a high-risk procedure for parathyroid impairment because of inadvertent gland removal or devascularization. PGRIS is considered an indirect marker of difficulty in identifying and preserving the glands during thyroidectomy. It is typically reduced in challenging surgical procedures, and an independent risk factor for postoperative hypoparathyroidism 14 . The present trial that confirmed LS administration did not affect the PGRIS.\n\nThis study has several limitations. The results might have been biased by the paucity of patients enrolled, but unfortunately the COVID-19 outbreak severely limited patient inclusion. Moreover, it was mainly designed to assess intraoperative and postoperative blood loss; any conclusions about other variables need to be confirmed in larger trials. For example, it is not possible to exclude a potential impact of LS on postoperative parathyroid function, because patients who did not receive LS had an approximately 1.5 times higher rate of hypoparathyroidism (26 versus 17%), although this was not statistically significant. The single-centre design is certainly the principal reason for the relatively small number of patients enrolled, but at the same time this reduced the possible differences between centres beyond selection biases and homogeneity problems. Another limitation is that these patients were treated in a tertiary high-volume thyroid surgery centre; surgical team experience could have been be an important factor that reduced the possibility of negative outcomes occurring in both arms, independently of the effect of LS. It cannot be excluded that the possible positive effect of LS on postoperative outcomes might have been be more evident in a low-volume thyroid surgery setting. Finally, patients were not blinded to the group allocation because a placebo with the same organoleptic characteristics of LS was not available; however, the measured variables were objective and not influenced by patient knowledge of the randomization group.\n\nThe present study has confirmed that preoperative LS can significantly reduce FT3 and FT4 levels in patients with GD, but this does not decrease intraoperative and postoperative blood loss, thyroid vascularization, duration of surgery, and surgical morbidity. Moreover, LS presents with some problems in availability, tolerability, and reduced patient compliance. Thus, LS administration cannot be considered a mandatory procedure in patients with GD before total thyroidectomy.",
