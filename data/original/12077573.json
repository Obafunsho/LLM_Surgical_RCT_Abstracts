  "title": "Off-Pump Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting is Overutilized",
  "abstract": "Off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), developed to avoid the potential complications of cardiopulmonary bypass, remains a subject of debate. Studies have demonstrated that off-pump CABG is associated with higher rates of incomplete revascularization, inferior graft patency, and increased reintervention rates compared to on-pump CABG, leading to worse outcomes. The theoretical neuroprotective and renal-protective benefits associated with off-pump CABG have not been definitively proven, with stroke and renal failure rates similar to those of on-pump CABG in both short- and long-term follow-up. Off-pump CABG presents technical challenges, contributing to a steep learning curve, and its effectiveness is dependent on surgeon and center experience. Lower-volume centers and surgeons performing off-pump CABG have shown increased rates of mortality and reintervention. Despite the potential cost savings by avoiding cardiopulmonary bypass, the need for repeat interventions and associated complications can lead to higher long-term healthcare costs. This paper advocates for a more selective use of off-pump CABG while maintaining on-pump CABG as the standard approach for patients with coronary artery disease.",
