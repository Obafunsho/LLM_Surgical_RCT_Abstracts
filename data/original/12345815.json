  "abstract": "BACKGROUND:: Hemorrhoids significantly impact quality of life and health care costs. Although rubber band ligation and hemorrhoidectomy are common treatments for grade III hemorrhoids, comparative cost-effectiveness data are limited.\n\nOBJECTIVE:: To assess the cost-effectiveness and cost-utility of rubber band ligation compared to hemorrhoidectomy from a societal perspective within the context of the HOLLAND trial.\n\nDESIGN:: Cost-effectiveness and cost-utility analyses using data from a multicenter, randomized controlled trial.\n\nSETTINGS:: Ten Dutch hospitals participating in the HOLLAND trial.\n\nPATIENTS:: Adults with symptomatic grade III hemorrhoids randomly assigned to receive rubber band ligation or hemorrhoidectomy treatment.\n\nINTERVENTIONS:: Rubber band ligation (up to 2 sessions) or excisional hemorrhoidectomy.\n\nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURES:: Cost per quality-adjusted life year gained and cost per recurrence avoided over 24 months from a societal perspective.\n\nRESULTS:: Seventy-nine patients were analyzed (33 for hemorrhoidectomy and 46 for rubber band ligation). Hemorrhoidectomy resulted in better clinical outcomes with a quality-adjusted life year difference of 0.08 (95% CI, 0.04–0.13) and a recurrence difference of 33.5% (95% CI, 15.3%–51.7%). Hospital costs were higher for hemorrhoidectomy (€1364; 95% CI, 895–1834; p < 0.001), as were societal costs (€1984; 95% CI, –132 to 4101; p = 0.066). The incremental cost-utility ratio for hemorrhoidectomy was €24,042 per quality-adjusted life year gained, and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was €5918 per recurrence avoided. The probability of hemorrhoidectomy being cost-effective was 45.5% at €20,000 per quality-adjusted life year and 83.9% at €50,000 per quality-adjusted life year. For recurrence avoidance, probabilities were 98.3% and 99.8%, respectively.\n\nLIMITATIONS:: The small sample size may limit generalizability and the ability to detect rare but costly complications. Procedural costs were based on average hospital prices, which is a pragmatic approach but is less detailed than bottom-up costing.\n\nCONCLUSIONS:: In patients with grade III hemorrhoids, hemorrhoidectomy provides better long-term clinical outcomes, including higher quality of life and lower recurrence rates compared to rubber band ligation. However, its cost-effectiveness varies depending on societal willingness-to-pay thresholds. Caution is warranted before discarding it as a first-line treatment solely based on health care costs or limited operating room availability.

Si bien la ligadura con banda elástica y la hemorroidectomía son tratamientos comunes para las hemorroides de grado III, los datos comparativos de costo-efectividad son limitados. OBJETIVO: Evaluar el costo-efectividad y el costo-utilidad de la ligadura con banda elástica en comparación con la hemorroidectomía desde una perspectiva social en el contexto del ensayo HOLLAND. DISEÑO: Análisis de costo-efectividad y costo-utilidad utilizando datos de un ensayo controlado aleatorizado multicéntrico. ESTABLECIMIENTO: Diez hospitales holandeses participantes en el ensayo HOLLAND. PACIENTES: Adultos con hemorroides sintomáticas de grado III aleatorizados a ligadura con banda elástica o hemorroidectomía. INTERVENCIONES: Ligadura con banda elástica (hasta dos sesiones) o hemorroidectomía escisional. PRINCIPALES MEDIDAS DE VALORACIÓN: Costo por año de vida ajustado a calidad (AVAC) ganado y costo por recurrencia evitada durante 24 meses desde una perspectiva social. RESULTADOS: Se analizaron setenta y nueve pacientes (33 hemorroidectomía, 46 ligadura con banda elástica). La hemorroidectomía presentó mejores resultados clínicos, con una diferencia de AVAC de 0,08 (IC del 95 %, 0,04-0,13) y una diferencia de recurrencia del 33,5 % (IC del 95 %, 15,3 %-51,7 %). Los costes hospitalarios fueron mayores para la hemorroidectomía (1364 €; IC del 95 %, 895-1834; p < 0,001), al igual que los costes sociales (1984 €; IC del 95 %, -132-4101; p = 0,066). La razón costo-utilidad incremental para la hemorroidectomía fue de 24.042 € por AVAC ganado, y la razón costo-efectividad incremental fue de 5.918 € por recurrencia evitada. La probabilidad de que la hemorroidectomía sea costo-efectiva fue del 45,5% con 20.000 €/AVAC y del 83,9% con 50.000 €/AVAC. Para la prevención de la recurrencia, las probabilidades fueron del 98,3% y del 99,8%, respectivamente. LIMITACIONES: El pequeño tamaño de la muestra puede limitar la generalización y la capacidad de detectar complicaciones poco frecuentes pero costosas. Los costos del procedimiento se basaron en los precios hospitalarios promedio, lo cual constituye un enfoque pragmático, aunque menos detallado que el cálculo de costos ascendente. CONCLUSIONES: En pacientes con hemorroides de grado III, la hemorroidectomía ofrece mejores resultados clínicos a largo plazo, incluyendo una mayor calidad de vida y menores tasas de recurrencia en comparación con la ligadura con banda elástica. Sin embargo, su costo-efectividad varía en función de los umbrales de disposición a pagar de la sociedad. Se recomienda precaución antes de descartarla como tratamiento de primera línea basándose únicamente en los costos sanitarios o la disponibilidad limitada de quirófanos. (Traducción--Ingrid Melo )",

  "full_text": "MATERIALS AND METHODS\n\nSetting and Population\n\nThe study protocol, economic evaluation plan, and main results of the HOLLAND trial have been published previously. 19 , 20 The study was approved by the Medical Ethical Committee Amsterdam University Medical Center and prospectively registered ( NCT04621695 ).\n\nIn brief, adults with symptomatic grade III hemorrhoids (Goligher classification) unresponsive to conservative measures, no history of anal surgery, and no more than 1 prior RBL or sclerotherapy treatment in the past 3 years were eligible. Patients were referred to 1 of 10 participating hospitals and randomly assigned to hemorrhoidectomy or RBL. RBL procedures were performed in an outpatient clinic setting, whereas hemorrhoidectomies were conducted in the operating room, typically as day-case procedures. In the RBL group, a second banding procedure was allowed at 6 weeks if symptoms persisted, reflecting clinical practice and previous trial results. 12 Primary clinical outcomes were QALYs and recurrence, defined as more than 2 RBL sessions (RBL group), an additional surgical procedure (either group), or self-reported recurrence on the long-term follow-up questionnaires.\n\nEconomic Evaluation\n\nThis economic evaluation includes a cost-utility analysis (CUA) and cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) from a societal perspective in a nationwide setting. Primary end points are the incremental cost per QALY gained (CUA) and the incremental cost per recurrence avoided (CEA). These costs are compared to willingness-to-pay thresholds.\n\nBecause of the early trial termination caused by slow enrollment, which was strongly influenced by treatment preferences and the COVID-19 pandemic, analyses were limited to a 2-year time horizon (reflecting the trial follow-up period) rather than the lifelong horizon originally planned. No budget impact analysis from governmental or insurer perspectives was performed. This article follows the Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards 2022 Statement (see Supplemental Table 1 at https://links.lww.com/DCR/C528 ). 21\n\nCost Components\n\nHealth care resource use during 2 years was assessed using case report forms, electronic hospital records, and patient self-reports. In-hospital resource use included 1) the study procedures (RBL or hemorrhoidectomy), 2) admission type, 3) outpatient visits, 4) telephone consultations, 5) diagnostics, 6) complications, 7) emergency room visits, 8) readmissions, 9) additional treatments, 10) prescribed medications, and 11) specialist consultations.\n\nPatient-reported data on out-of-hospital care, out-of-pocket expenses, and productivity losses were collected at 6 weeks, 6 months, 12 months, and 24 months postintervention. Out-of-hospital care, documented with the iMTA Medical Consumption Questionnaire (iMCQ), included consultations with general practitioners, physiotherapists, occupational physicians, dietitians, and nurse specialists, as well as nonreimbursable expenses such as travel costs and over-the-counter medications. 22 Informal care costs, such as family support, were not included, as these were not systematically captured by the questionnaires. Productivity losses (absenteeism and reduced work productivity) were captured with the iMTA Productivity Cost Questionnaire (iPCQ). 23 Costs were categorized as study procedures, hospital admission type, outpatient hospital care, diagnostic procedures, medications, additional treatments, out-of-hospital consultations, out-of-pocket expenses, and productivity losses.\n\nUnit Costing\n\nUnit costs and sources are presented in Table 1 . Unit costing followed the latest Dutch Costing Manual for health care research, using standardized unit costs for hospital admissions, outpatient visits, emergency care, out-of-hospital consultations, travel expenses, and productivity losses. 24 Productivity losses were calculated using average costs per lost working hour.\n\nSurgical and diagnostic procedure costs, including the treatment of complications, were derived from hospital ledger data and averaged across specialized centers and nonacademic and academic hospitals. To ensure a generalizable costing framework, costs from nonacademic hospitals and specialized centers were prioritized, as these facilities provide the majority of proctological care in the Netherlands. When data from these sources were unavailable, average unit costs from academic hospitals were used as substitutes.\n\nHemorrhoidectomy costs included personnel, operating room time, anesthetics, and overhead. Postprocedure medication costs were calculated per prescription, weighted by drug volume (eg, laxatives, antibiotics, creams, analgesics), with unit prices per daily dose based on National Health Insurance Board reimbursement rates. 25 Pharmacy dispensing fees were excluded. Out-of-pocket expenses were recorded as the average monthly patient-reported costs over the preceding 3 months. The friction cost method was used to estimate missed and inefficient duty hours. All costs are in 2023 euros, adjusted for inflation using the Dutch Consumer Price Index when necessary. 26\n\nQuality of Life\n\nThe study evaluated differences in QALYs between the randomized groups during the 2-year follow-up period based on health-related quality-of-life scores. Data were collected using the euroqol 5 dimensions 5 levels (EQ-5D-5L) questionnaire, which used Dutch wording and population norms (range, –0.446 to 2.0, with 2.0 indicating optimal health for 24 mo). 27 , 28 EQ-5D-5L questionnaires were administered at baseline and several posttreatment intervals, including day 1, week 1, week 6, months 6, 12, and 24. QALYs were calculated by multiplying the overall quality of life at each time point by the period of time using the area under the curve method.\n\nHandling of Missing Data\n\nQuestionnaires were sent out to all randomized patients at the specified time points. Missing questionnaires from nonresponders, along with incomplete or inappropriate responses, were considered missing data. Costs and QALYs were imputed multiple times at the item per time point level. Ten imputation sets were generated using MICE with predictive mean matching and combined using Rubin’s rule. 29 Dependencies over time were taken into account by including measurements over all time points.\n\nStatistical and Economic Analyses\n\nAnalyses were performed using SPSS Statistics 28 (IBM, Armonk, NY) and R Studio 4.3.2 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria). Descriptive statistics were used to evaluate data quality and homogeneity, with a 2-sided significance level set at a p value of <0.05. Results are presented as means, mean differences, and 95% CIs.\n\nCost-utility and cost-effectiveness analyses (CUA and CEA) were conducted in relation to the primary outcomes of the HOLLAND trial: differences in QALYs and recurrence during the 2 years. Missing self-reported recurrence data at 2 years were imputed using the last observation from 6- or 12-month follow-ups.\n\nTotal costs per patient were calculated as resource use volumes multiplied by unit costs. Cost differences were evaluated using independent samples t tests. Incremental cost-utility ratios (ICURs) and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were calculated for the cost per QALY and the cost per recurrence avoided, respectively. Cost-utility planes and acceptability curves were generated, including analyses based solely on hospital costs. The CIs of the ICER and ICUR were based on bias-corrected and accelerated nonparametric bootstrapping of 1000 bootstrap samples after combining the multiple data sets into 1 mean single imputation. 29\n\nSensitivity Analyses\n\nSensitivity analyses were performed to assess the robustness of the cost-effectiveness results. First, medical cost components were varied by constructing high-cost scenarios for each treatment: for RBL, this was based on average internal hospital rates; for hemorrhoidectomy, it was based on standard tariffs for noninsured care. In addition, we followed recommendations from the Dutch Costing Manual and applied a 20% increase in procedure costs. Second, a broader sensitivity analysis was conducted, in which total societal costs were varied by ±20%, separately for health care costs and productivity losses, to assess their impact.\n\nRESULTS\n\nBaseline\n\nDuring a 37-month period (September 2019–November 2022), concluding with the final questionnaire on November 1, 2024, a total of 79 patients (33 hemorrhoidectomy vs 46 rubber band ligation) were recruited in the trial’s study population. The flowchart detailing the study population and group distribution was previously published alongside the clinical results and is provided as Supplemental Figure 1 at https://links.lww.com/DCR/C527 . Baseline characteristics of the study population are summarized in Table 2 . The overall response rate for all questionnaires was 88%, with specific response rates for the long-term follow-up questionnaires of 90%, 87%, and 84% at 6, 12, and 24 months, respectively.\n\nResource Use and Costs\n\nThe mean resource use volumes and associated costs for each treatment strategy are presented in Table 3 , with total hospital and societal costs for both the base- and high-case procedural cost scenarios summarized at the bottom.\n\nIn the base-case scenario, the mean total hospital costs were €2683 (95% CI, 2325–3041) for the hemorrhoidectomy strategy and €1318 (95% CI, 1014–1622) for the RBL strategy, resulting in a statistically significant mean difference of €1364 (95% CI, 895–1834; p < 0.001) in favor of RBL. Under the high-case scenario for study procedures, this difference increased to €1752 (95% CI, 1206–2298; p < 0.001).\n\nConversely, mean total societal costs were €6259 (95% CI, 4648–7869) for the hemorrhoidectomy group and €4274 (95% CI, 2905–5644) for the RBL group, yielding a mean difference of €1984 (95% CI, –132 to 4101; p = 0.066) in favor of RBL, although not statistically significant. In the high-case scenario, mean societal costs were €6,851 (95% CI, 5219–8483) for the hemorrhoidectomy group versus €4479 (95% CI, 3092–5867) for the RBL group, with an increased mean difference of €2372 (95% CI, 227–4516; p = 0.031), which was statistically significant.\n\nQuality of Life and Recurrence Rate\n\nQuality of life, expressed in QALYs, was 1.90 (95% CI, 1.84–1.95) in the hemorrhoidectomy group and 1.82 (95% CI, 1.77–1.87) in the RBL group, with a difference of 0.08 QALYs (95% CI, 0.06–0.16; p = 0.034). The recurrence rate in the RBL group was 45.7% (95% CI, 31.2%–60.8%), compared to 12.1% (95% CI, 4.0–29.1%) in the hemorrhoidectomy group. This corresponds to an absolute risk difference of 33.5% (95% CI, 15.3–51.7%; p = 0.002) in favor of the hemorrhoidectomy group. Further details on self-reported recurrence rates and additional treatments after the index procedure are presented in Table 4 .\n\nIncremental Cost-Utility and Cost-Effectiveness Analyses\n\nFrom a societal perspective, over the 24-month time horizon of the trial, the hemorrhoidectomy strategy resulted in an increase of €1984 in costs, 0.08 more QALYs, and a 33.5% lower recurrence rate compared to the RBL strategy.\n\nThe point-estimated ICUR, representing the cost per QALY gained, was €24,042 (95% BCa CI, 2453–160,603) in the base-case scenario. Figure 1 presents the cost-effectiveness plane, showing the mean societal costs against the mean differences in QALYs based on 1000 bootstrap simulations. The vast majority (97.2%) of these bootstraps fell within the upper-right quadrant, indicating that the hemorrhoidectomy strategy is more effective but also more expensive than RBL.\n\nFigure 2 presents the cost-effectiveness acceptability curve, illustrating the probability that hemorrhoidectomy is more cost-effective than 2× RBL at varying willingness-to-pay thresholds per QALY gained. At a willingness-to-pay threshold of €20,000 per QALY, the probability of cost-effectiveness for hemorrhoidectomy was 45.5%, whereas at a threshold of €50,000 per QALY, this probability increased to 83.9%. The more society is willing to pay per extra QALY, the more acceptable hemorrhoidectomy becomes as the more expensive strategy.\n\nThe point-estimated ICER was €5918 (95% BCa CI, 719–22,566) per recurrence avoided from a societal perspective in the base-case scenario. Figure 3 illustrates the cost-effectiveness plane, showing the mean societal costs against the number of prevented recurrences in the RBL group compared to the hemorrhoidectomy group, based on 1000 bootstrap simulations. The majority (97.6%) of the bootstraps fell within the upper-right quadrant, indicating that hemorrhoidectomy is more expensive but again more effective than RBL.\n\nThe cost-effectiveness acceptability curve for willingness to pay up to €50,000 per recurrence avoided shows that the probability of hemorrhoidectomy being cost-effective increases from 98.3% at €20,000 to 99.8% at €50,000, as shown in Figure 4 .\n\nSensitivity Analyses\n\nThe differences in mean hospital costs were smaller than those in mean societal costs, resulting in steeper cost-effectiveness acceptability curves and higher probabilities of hemorrhoidectomy being cost-effective from a health care perspective. Specifically, the ICUR for health care costs per QALY was €16,530 (95% BCa CI, 7661–61,400), with probabilities of 65.8% at a €20,000 threshold and 95.8% at €50,000, as shown in Figure 2 . For health care costs per recurrence avoided, the ICUR was €4069 (95% BCa CI, 2126–10,731), with probabilities of 99.6% at €20,000 and 99.8% at €50,000, as shown in Figure 4 .\n\nScenario analyses based on increased treatment costs (a 20% increase) and high-cost estimates derived from hospital tariffs consistently showed lower health care costs for RBL compared to hemorrhoidectomy. In all scenarios, the ICERs and ICURs were in favor of hemorrhoidectomy due to its higher effectiveness (see Supplemental Table 2 at https://links.lww.com/DCR/C529 ).\n\nIn the broader sensitivity analyses, total societal costs varied by ±20%, separately for health care costs and productivity losses (see Supplemental Table 3 at https://links.lww.com/DCR/C530 ). In all scenarios, RBL was associated with lower mean costs compared to hemorrhoidectomy. The ICERs ranged from €21,040 to €27,044 per QALY when varying health care costs and from €22,236 to €25,848 per QALY when varying productivity losses.\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nThis study provides a comprehensive cost-effectiveness and CUA of RBL versus hemorrhoidectomy for grade III hemorrhoids using data from the HOLLAND trial. Although RBL has lower upfront costs (cost savings of €1984 per patient), hemorrhoidectomy offers superior clinical outcomes, and it appears to be the more cost-effective option, with probabilities ranging from 45.5% to 83.9% depending on societal willingness-to-pay thresholds. At these thresholds, the likelihood of hemorrhoidectomy being cost-effective for recurrence avoidance is close to 100%. These findings underscore the need to balance cost savings against clinical outcomes when considering treatment strategies.\n\nThis study is the first prospective cost-effectiveness comparison of RBL and hemorrhoidectomy. Previous studies focused on other treatments, used retrospective designs, or lacked clinical applicability, contributing to the ongoing ambiguity in guidelines. 5 , 6 , 30 The robust design of this trial, with high patient involvement and response rates, provides valuable insights to guide clinical decisions.\n\nWith a growing and aging population, rising health care costs demand attention to both clinical and economic outcomes. Previous literature has reported varying cost-effectiveness results for hemorrhoid treatments. The Hubble trial demonstrated that hemorrhoidal artery ligation (HAL) was not cost-effective compared to RBL, whereas the eTHoS trial favored hemorrhoidectomy over stapled hemorrhoidopexy. 14 , 15 Other studies showed that Doppler-guided hemorrhoidal artery ligation is less effective and more costly than stapled hemorrhoidopexy. 16 However, other research found insufficient evidence to recommend stapled hemorrhoidopexy over RBL, highlighting the ongoing debate about the optimal treatment approach. 17\n\nThese findings are relevant in light of recent policy shifts aimed at reducing hemorrhoidectomy reimbursements to allocate operating room resources for other surgical priorities. For instance, the UK National Health Service limits hemorrhoidectomy access to cut costs, favoring outpatient treatments such as RBL. 31 Although such policies promote cost-saving measures, our findings suggest that the superior clinical outcomes of hemorrhoidectomy should be carefully considered before RBL is adopted as the first-line treatment for grade III hemorrhoids. The potential long-term costs of higher recurrence rates and additional surgeries after RBL, together with the impact on quality of life, must be weighed against the immediate savings.\n\nCoughlin et al 18 reported repeated RBL as cost-effective, with success rates rising from 57% after 1 session to 91% after 4 sessions, although 6% required surgery. 18 They estimated RBL costs at $723 per patient (range, $382–$4430), with a mean QALY of 0.997, concluding sequential banding remained dominant even after multiple sessions. In comparison, hemorrhoidectomy was reported to be 2.75 times more expensive and associated with 9.45 times lower QALYs. However, these findings contrast with our study, which showed greater QALY gains for hemorrhoidectomy at 2-year follow-up.\n\nMethodological differences likely explain these contrasting results. The retrospective design of their study, reliance on historical banding data, and hypothetical cost estimates may have introduced bias. In addition, their inclusion of heterogeneous patient cohorts across all Goligher grades reduced applicability to grade III hemorrhoids. Although repeated RBL demonstrated lower upfront costs, patients requiring surgery after failed RBL faced higher cumulative costs and reduced quality of life, underscoring the importance of individualized treatment planning and comprehensive cost assessments.\n\nOur study demonstrated that hemorrhoidectomy resulted in fewer recurrences, assessed through additional treatments and self-reported recurrences, rather than prolapse severity alone. However, the severity of hemorrhoids in patients reporting recurrence on questionnaires and its implications for treatment remains unclear, as these patients did not seek further treatment yet.\n\nStudy Limitations\n\nSeveral limitations must be acknowledged. First, the intended sample size was not reached, limiting statistical power and precluding broader budget impact analyses. It may also have limited the detection of rare but costly complications, particularly in the hemorrhoidectomy group. This limited sample size was primarily due to high rates of nonparticipation, with many eligible patients declining randomization because of a strong preference for RBL over surgery. Second, reliance on patient-reported outcomes introduces potential recall bias. Third, procedural costs were estimated using average hospital prices rather than detailed bottom-up calculations. Although this approach is reasonable, the lack of pricing transparency and variability in agreements with insurers complicates accurate cost determination in the Dutch health care system. Finally, the number of hemorrhoid piles treated was only systematically recorded in the hemorrhoidectomy group, potentially influencing recurrence comparisons.\n\nDespite these limitations, the use of patient-reported questionnaires to capture health care resource use and societal costs enhances internal validity. The high response rate further minimizes selection bias, strengthening the reliability and generalizability of our findings.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nIn the design of this trial, we initially hypothesized that “up to 2 RBL treatments are noninferior to hemorrhoidectomy in terms of quality of life and recurrence risk, whereas being more cost-effective.” Our findings challenge this assumption, showing that while RBL offers lower upfront costs, hemorrhoidectomy provides better long-term clinical outcomes, including reduced recurrence and improved quality of life. For patients with grade III hemorrhoids, hemorrhoidectomy may be more cost-effective than RBL, and therefore, caution is needed before discarding it as a routine first-line treatment solely based on rising health care costs or limited operating room availability.",
