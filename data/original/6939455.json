  "title": "Impact of Aortic Atherosclerosis Burden on Outcomes of Surgical Aortic Valve Replacement",
  "abstract": "Background: Epiaortic ultrasound detects and localizes ascending aortic atherosclerosis. In this analysis we investigated the association between epiaortic ultrasound-based atheroma grade during surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) and perioperative adverse outcomes.\n\nMethods: SAVR patients in a randomized trial of two embolic protection devices underwent a protocol-defined 5-view epiaortic ultrasound read at a core-laboratory. Aortic atherosclerosis was quantified with Katz atheroma grade and patients were categorized into mild (grade I-II) versus moderate/severe (grade III-V). Multivariable logistic regression was used to estimate associations between atheroma grade and adverse outcomes including death, clinically apparent stroke, cerebral infarction on diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI), delirium, and acute kidney injury (AKI) by 7 and 30 days.\n\nResults: Of the 383 randomized patients, 326 (85.1%) had pre-cannulation epiaortic ultrasound data available. Of these, 106 (32.5%) had moderate/severe Katz atheroma grade at any segment of the ascending aorta. While there were no significant differences in the composite of death, stroke or cerebral infarction on DW-MRI by 7 days, moderate/severe atheroma grade was associated with a greater risk of AKI by 7 days (adjusted odds ratio [OR]: 2.63; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.24–5.58; p=0.01). At 30 days, patients with moderate/severe atheroma grade had a greater risk of death, stroke or AKI (adjusted OR: 1.97; 95%CI: 1.04–3.71; p=0.04).\n\nConclusions: Moderate/severe aortic atherosclerosis was associated with an increased risk of adverse events following SAVR. Epiaortic ultrasound may serve as a useful adjunct for identifying patients who may benefit from strategies to reduce atheroembolic complications during SAVR.",
