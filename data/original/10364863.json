Factors such as grade, tumour size, age, and lymph node positivity correlate independently with local recurrence-free survival. However, efforts to de-escalate local therapy using these factors, such as omitting radiotherapy for patients perceived as low risk after breast-conserving surgery (BCS), have so far failed in prospective clinical trials 1–5 . Similarly, age and categorization as low risk based on clinical factors were not able to distinguish between patients who may or may not benefit from mastectomy compared with BCS 6 , 7 . With respect to radiotherapy after BCS, even patients with small low-grade breast cancers benefited from adjuvant radiotherapy in terms of risk of local recurrence in clinical trials 8 .\n\nThere is an urgent need to develop diagnostic tools to better estimate the local recurrence risk in order to predict the benefit of local therapy, guide optimal and tailored locoregional treatment strategies, and thus further reduce avoidable side-effects and costs of breast cancer treatment. The development of multigene expression assays has improved ability to distinguish between intrinsic molecular subtypes of breast cancer (such as luminal A and B), and to differentiate between patients at low and high risk of recurrence, independently of classical clinical prognostic factors such as nodal status or age 9–11 . Perhaps more controversially, these tests have also been accepted by some to predict benefit from systemic chemotherapy and extended endocrine therapy. Although there seems to be a good prognostic correlation with the risk of local recurrence determined by Endopredict ® 12 (Myriad Genetics, Salt Lake City, USA), Oncotype DX ® 13 (Genomic Health, USA) or Mammaprint ® 14 (Agendia, Amsterdam NL) multigene tests, it is unknown whether these also predict the efficacy of local therapy 15 .\n\nThe aim of this study was to investigate whether a risk-of-recurrence (ROR) score derived from the PAM-50-based 46-gene assay (Prosigna ® ) adds additional prognostic value to known clinical risk factors for local recurrence in early-stage breast cancer, and to evaluate its predictive value for the benefit of radiotherapy.\n\nMethods\n\nThe ABCSG initiated a prospective randomized trial (ABCSG-8) comparing 5 years of adjuvant tamoxifen with sequential therapy consisting of tamoxifen for 2 years followed by anastrozole for 3 years in postmenopausal women with endocrine receptor-positive early-stage breast cancer 16 . Between January 1996 and June 2004, 3901 patients were enrolled ( NCT00291759 ). A CONSORT diagram is available in the original publication 16 . Notably, 869 patients in ABCSG-8 were also included in a second randomization built into that trial, comparing radiotherapy with no radiotherapy after breast conservation (ABCSG-8A) 8 .\n\nAll patients provided written informed consent and the trial was approved by the relevant ethics committees, and done in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumour blocks from 1620 patients from the ABCSG-8 trial were available for the PAM-50 multigene assay, with 1478 samples passing quality control standards 17 . Local therapy and relapse data for these patients were analysed in the present study.\n\nLocal therapy\n\nIn this multicentre trial, local therapy strategies followed established clinical practice guidelines, except the additional randomization to radiotherapy or no radiotherapy in selected patients with a favourable prognosis 5 . In short, all patients underwent BCS or mastectomy with resection-free margins (R0 definition according to centres’ preference). Sentinel node biopsy was performed in patients with clinically lymph node-negative disease, and axillary lymph node dissection in all with macrometastases or micrometastases. Patients who underwent mastectomy were excluded from the present analysis. All patients, except those randomized to no adjuvant radiotherapy within the ABCSG-8A subtrial, received radiotherapy after BCS. For consistency, patients who were randomized to no radiotherapy after BCS within ABCSG-8A were not included in the present analysis except for the interaction test of ROR and radiotherapy ( Fig. S1 ).\n\nFollow-up\n\nAll patients were routinely followed up every 3 months throughout the first year, at 6-month intervals through the second and third years, and yearly thereafter. Physical examination by breast palpation, gynaecological examination, thoracic X-ray, abdominal ultrasonography or CT of the chest and abdomen, and mammography were used as appropriate to screen for local and distant recurrence. Overall survival was recorded by documented deaths. Local relapses documented as events for this study were usually confirmed histologically.\n\nDefinition of local recurrence as endpoint\n\nLocal recurrence was defined as in-breast or chest wall recurrence. Regional recurrence, distant recurrence, and deaths from breast cancer or second primary carcinoma, and deaths without breast cancer or with unknown breast cancer status, were considered competing-risk events.\n\nPAM-50-based Prosigna ® test\n\nA detailed description of the PAM-50-based 46-gene Prosigna ® assay, and the conversion of gene expression measurements into ROR scores and intrinsic molecular subtypes has been reported elsewhere 11 , 18 . In short, RNA was extracted from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded blocks from breast cancer excision specimens from the ABCSG-8 trial. The PAM-50 assay simultaneously measures the expression levels of 50 target genes plus eight housekeeping genes in a single hybridization reaction 18 .\n\nStatistical analysis\n\nThe primary objective of the study was to investigate whether the ROR score can provide prognostic information on local recurrence. Secondary objectives were to evaluate whether such prognostic information can be gained from intrinsic subtypes, and whether the ROR score is predictive of radiotherapy benefit. The data were analysed in a competing-risk framework with local recurrences as the events of interest, and regional recurrences, distant metastases, secondary malignancies, and death as competing events. Fine–Gray subdistribution hazard models were used to assess the effects of the ROR score, ROR score-derived risk groups, intrinsic subtypes, and individual prognostic factors, such as age (continuous), tumour size (T1 versus T2 or T3), nodal status (N0 versus N1–N3), treatment (tamoxifen or tamoxifen followed by anastrozole), and progesterone receptor status (positive versus negative), as well as a possible interaction between ROR and radiotherapy. Summary statistics from Fine–Gray models 19 include subhazard ratios (SHRs) with 95 per cent confidence intervals. A two-sided α value of 0.05 was used for all tests. Additionally, 5- and 10-year cumulative rates of local recurrence were estimated (with 95 per cent confidence intervals). In all analyses, data from the full investigational period were considered, except for the univariable comparisons of risk groups, which were censored at 5 and 10 years. Censoring at 5 and 10 years was done to ensure that estimated SHRs and P values were based on the data up to these time points.\n\nPatients were initially assigned to one of three ROR score-derived risk groups using the original cut-off values defined for distant recurrence. They were divided into three groups with low, intermediate, and high risk, and were also dichotomized by combinations of high–intermediate and intermediate–low risk. To assess whether classification into risk groups based on local relapses was possible, the patients were recategorized into a low- and a high-risk group using a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve for local recurrence data (time-dependent ROC curves) and the Youden index 20 . In contrast to distant recurrence, no difference in 10-year risk was observed between patients with node-negative and node-positive disease with respect to local recurrence. Owing to the low number of events, a division into more than two risk groups was not deemed appropriate.\n\nSAS ® version 9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, North Carolina, USA) was used for all analyses.\n\nResults\n\nTable 1 shows demographic data for 1034 patients undergoing BCS and radiotherapy. All patients were assigned randomly to either five years of tamoxifen (525) or tamoxifen followed by anastrozole (509) after surgery. There were no patients with high-grade (G3) breast cancer in this analysis because such women were not included in the ABCSG-8 feeder trial. Although nearly all of the patients had oestrogen receptor-positive disease as confirmed by immunohistochemistry, 36 (3.5 per cent) had either human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-enriched or basal-like breast cancer as evaluated by the PAM-50 multigene test.\n\nThere were 765 patients (74.0 per cent) with a low ROR score (below 57). A total of 709 patients (68.6 per cent) had luminal A tumours according to the multigene assay. Patients with high-risk cancer, as defined by the ROR score, tended to be older (aged at least 65 years), and had significantly larger and more intermediate-grade tumours.\n\nLocal recurrences\n\nAfter a median follow-up of 10.8 years, a total of 23 local recurrence events were observed ( Table S1 ), corresponding to an overall risk of local recurrence of 2.2 per cent. Distant recurrence was observed in 11.6 per cent of patients and 6.8 per cent died from breast cancer during follow-up. A secondary malignancy was diagnosed in 14.0 per cent, and 11.6 per cent died without breast cancer recurrence. In 1.1 per cent of patients with local recurrence, distant recurrences developed synchronously (1) or metachronously (14).\n\nRisk-of-recurrence score, intrinsic subtype, and local recurrence risk\n\nUnivariable analyses of the continuous ROR score showed the prognostic value of PAM-50 for local recurrence; SHRs for a 10-point increase were 1.72 (95 per cent c.i. 1.38 to 2.14; P < 0.001) and 1.41 (1.11 to 1.77; P = 0.004) at 5 and 10 years respectively. This remained significant in multivariable analyses for the full period (SHR 1.40, 1.15 to 1.71; P = 0.001).\n\nNo significant differences between the three original ROR risk groups based on distant recurrence were observed at 10 years (high versus low risk: SHR 3.11, 0.84 to 11.49, P = 0.089; intermediate versus low risk: SHR 1.36, 0.30 to 6.07, P = 0.688). SHRs were not computable at 5 years owing to few events.\n\nAs these cut-offs based on distant metastases were not applicable, a cut-off based on local recurrences was calculated from the data using a time-dependent ROC curve ( Fig. S2 ). According to these results, patients with ROR scores below 57 were considered to be at genomic low risk of local recurrence. Univariable analysis demonstrated that low-risk patients had a significantly lower incidence of local recurrence than those in the high-risk group at 5 years (0.1 (95 per cent c.i. 0 to 0.7) versus 2.2 (0.9 to 4.6) per cent respectively; subhazard ratio (SHR) 17.18, 95 per cent c.i. 2.06 to 142.88; P = 0.009) and 10 years (0.9 (0.4 to 2.0) versus 3.8 (1.9 to 6.6) per cent; SHR 4.76, 1.72 to 13.17; P = 0.003) ( Fig. 1 ). Multivariable analyses including risk group, age, tumour size, nodal status, progesterone receptor status, tumor grade, and adjuvant treatment, confirmed that PAM-50 ROR score was an independent predictor for local recurrence ( Table 2 ).\n\nIn the PAM-50 subtype assessment, univariable analysis showed an increased risk of local recurrence in patients with luminal B tumours compared with luminal A disease, at 5 years (1.7 (95 per cent c.i. 0.7 to 3.8) versus 0.1 (0 to 0.8) per cent respectively; SHR 12.33, 95 per cent c.i. 1.44 to 105.59; P = 0.022) and 10 years (3.2 (1.6 to 5.7) versus 1.0 (0.4 to 2.1) per cent; SHR 3.70, 1.31 to 10.41; P = 0.013) ( Fig. 2 ). In the multivariable Fine–Gray subhazard model including clinical and pathological variables, definition of breast cancer subtypes by PAM-50 also reached statistical significance for the complete investigational period ( Table 3 ).\n\nInteraction between risk-of-recurrence score and radiotherapy\n\nThe prognostic relevance of the PAM-50 assay for local recurrence after breast conservation was also seen in 170 women who did not received radiotherapy. The 5- and 10-year local recurrence rates were 14.6 and 20.8 per cent respectively among the 48 women without radiotherapy assigned to the high-risk group, compared with 1.6 and 5.0 per cent among 122 women in the low-risk group.\n\nA Fine–Gray subhazard interaction model including ROR score, radiotherapy, and the respective interaction showed similar SHRs for a 10-point increase in ROR score among patients who received radiotherapy (SHR 1.37, 95 per cent 1.11 to 1.70) as well as for those who did not have radiotherapy (SHR 1.23, 0.98 to 1.54) ( P = 0.479 for interaction), suggesting no predictive effect of PAM-50 for efficacy of radiotherapy ( Table 4 ).\n\nDiscussion\n\nThe present data show that the PAM-50 ROR score and intrinsic molecular subtypes can identify a genomic low-risk population within the group of patients with a clinically low risk of local recurrence (superlow risk of local recurrence). It has been shown that the PAM-50 ROR score is continuously related to the probability of disease recurrence. Consequently, cut-off points defining low- and high-risk disease strongly depend on the clinical setting and the clinical decision being made. Here an unbiased model-free approach was used to define a cut-off point for local recurrence risk based on the Youden’s index for a time-dependent ROC curve. This cut off-point (ROR score less than 57) is different from the commercial cut-off point for low risk of distant recurrence in the Prosigna ® assay (ROR score less than 40 for patients with node-negative disease) and therefore requires further validation. Women with breast cancer who had a low-risk PAM-50 ROR score (below 57) after BCS and radiotherapy had a 0.9 per cent probability of local relapse within 10 years, whereas patients with an intrinsic luminal A subtype breast cancer had a 1.0 per cent risk of local recurrence. Multivariable analysis in the present study demonstrated that PAM-50 is prognostic for local recurrence risk, independently of clinical risk factors such as nodal status, age or tumour size. Some 74.0 per cent of patients had a low-risk ROR score, whereas 68.6 per cent of tumours were classified as luminal A. Both the PAM-50 ROR score and intrinsic subtypes were able to identify a subgroup of patients with a very good prognosis regarding local recurrence risk in whom de-escalation of therapy may be an option. Exploratory analysis of the ability of PAM-50 to predict the efficacy of adjuvant radiotherapy did not, however, show any such benefit.\n\nMammaprint ® was the first multigene test evaluated for local recurrence prognosis in a retrospective data set 14 . Although this test had no significant prognostic efficacy for clinically high-risk patients, it was found to be an independent prognostic risk factor for clinically low-risk patients and identified a subgroup with superlow local recurrence risk 14 . In the Mammaprint ® trial 14 , the local recurrence risk after 10 years in the low-risk category was 6.1 per cent, whereas in the present study the PAM-50 superlow-risk group had a 10-year local recurrence risk of 0.9 per cent. Similarly, the authors’ group 12 previously reported a 10-year local recurrence risk of 1.4 per cent for the Endopredict ® low-risk group. Thus, the latter two tests seem to perform better in this respect; alternatively, the difference may reflect the superiority of more recent local therapy and differences in clinical risk parameters between studies.\n\nOncotype DX ® has been shown to be an independent prognostic tool for identification of a low-risk population for local recurrence within a clinically low-risk group of patients aged less than 50 years 13 . This low-risk group had a 10-year local recurrence risk of 1.6 per cent with adjuvant chemotherapy and tamoxifen, and 4.3 per cent with tamoxifen alone. The latter group had adjuvant treatment similar to the patients in the present study. As the 10-year local recurrence risk was 0.9 per cent with endocrine therapy alone, a slightly better performance for PAM-50 regarding local recurrence risk prognosis can be assumed. Moreover, Oncotype DX ® did not provide statistically significant prognostic information for patients older than 50 years (10-year local recurrence risk 3.6 per cent in low-risk group, 3.7 per cent in intermediate-risk group, and 4.8 per cent in high-risk group) 13 , whereas the present study was based on a trial of postmenopausal women, the vast majority of whom were aged over 50 years. Notably, of all data reported, the Oncotype DX ® intermediate-risk group receiving placebo in the National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project (NSABP) B-14 trial 13 had the highest local recurrence rate (20 per cent versus 10 per cent in low-risk and 18 per cent in high-risk groups) suggesting that intermediate groups are of no clear value.\n\nIndirect comparisons between studies should be interpreted with great caution. Inclusion criteria for the trials analysed were different regarding age and tumour grade, with more G3 tumours and younger patients in the Mammaprint ® and Oncotype DX ® trials. The present results suggest that PAM-50 and Endopredict ® are two possible multigene tests that clearly define a very low-risk group for local recurrence among postmenopausal women with a clinically low risk of breast cancer.\n\nTo investigate whether the PAM-50 test may predict the efficacy of radiotherapy after breast conservation, a subset of 170 women in the ABCSG-8 trial who did not receive adjuvant radiotherapy was analysed. These women were not included in the general risk score assessment in the present study. The 10-year local recurrence risk of only 5.0 per cent in the group of 122 patients with a low risk based on PAM-50 and clinical features, and who did not receive adjuvant radiotherapy, indicates that the option of no further radiotherapy can be discussed for this specific patient group. However the reduction of local recurrence rate in the low-risk group showed a similar hazard ratio compared with the high-risk group SHRs were compared between women who did or not receive radiotherapy in the groups with low- and high-risk scores. There was no significant difference between SHRs, and radiotherapy improved local recurrence-free survival in both groups. Owing to the limited number of patients and events, however, no final conclusions can be drawn from this exploratory analysis.\n\nStrengths of this study are the use of a prospectively controlled data set with a subset randomized to omission of radiotherapy, the large number of tumour blocks analysed, and the long follow-up of more than 10 years. Limitations include the retrospective nature of this analysis, and the small number of events (although the latter may be indicative of an excellent local treatment modality and may be a good quality indicator). The results have shown the possibility of classification into risk groups based on local recurrences. However, the validity of separation into risk groups needs to be determined and confirmed in larger cohorts with more events. The same is true regarding the potential predictive role of PAM-50 in terms of radiotherapy benefit.\n\nThe present study has demonstrated that a PAM-50-based assay can be used as a prognostic tool for local recurrence risk in postmenopausal women with hormone receptor- positive breast cancer treated with endocrine therapy. PAM-50 has the ability to accurately and reliably define a superlow-risk population within this low-risk group of women with breast cancer. This justifies a prospective trial comparing patients with and without adjuvant radiotherapy in the low-risk group.",
