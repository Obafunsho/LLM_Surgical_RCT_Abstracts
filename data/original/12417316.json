The impact of these two surgical procedures on cognition and dementia remains unclear, with conflicting findings reported in the literature. 15 , 16 , 17 Current literature on this topic has largely focused on short‐term cognitive or brain imaging outcomes, 17 , 18 , 19 , 20 , 21 , 22 , 23 , 24 , 25 , 26 with the limited data evaluating dementia risk finding no association. 27\n\nThis study aims to evaluate whether CEA or CAS treatments mitigate the increased AD and non‐AD dementia risk seen in patients with aECAD. The study uses longitudinal data from United States–based insurance claims records and propensity score matching methods for the analyses.\n\nMETHODS\n\nData source\n\nThe Mariner database 28 is an insurance claims dataset that serves the United States with patient populations from all US states and territories. Pearl Diver is for‐fee research software that facilitates interaction with individual commercial, state‐based Medicaid, Medicare stand‐alone prescription drug plan, group Medicare Advantage, and individual Medicare Advantage data. The Mariner dataset contains patient demographic characteristics and numerous other data points for patients with Current Procedural Terminology, International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision (ICD‐9‐CM), and International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, 10th Revision (ICD‐10‐CM) codes. Mariner encompasses all diagnoses, medications, and procedures of 161 million patients throughout the duration of the set with claims from November 2010 to October 2022.\n\nThis report follows the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) reporting guidelines. This study was approved by the University of Arizona Institutional Review Board. Requirements for informed consent were waived as the data were deidentified.\n\nStudy design and variables\n\nThe aECAD cohort was selected from 161 million Mariner patients by identifying individuals with two or more diagnosis claims for aECAD. Patients under the age of 55, as well as those with a history of any dementia, brain cancer, or neurosurgery prior to aECAD diagnosis were excluded. Additionally, patients with at least one diagnosis of stroke and/or transient ischemic attack (TIA) were excluded from the analysis to ensure an “asymptomatic” ECAD cohort (ICD‐9 and ICD‐10 codes used in Table S1 in supporting information) and to avoid confounding issues related to stroke physiology and its strong association with dementia. An active enrollment criterion of a minimum of 6 months before and 5 years after the diagnosis of aECAD was required. This criterion addressed important limiting factors such as patients lost to follow‐up, mortality, insurance changes, and sufficient time for the development of AD (Figure 1 ). Further, 6 months prior to index date was used to calculate the baseline comorbidities for both groups. The index date was selected as the first date of an aECAD diagnosis. The treatment group consisted of participants diagnosed with aECAD who underwent at least one surgical procedure of CEA or CAS, while the control group included patients without CEA and CAS procedures. All ICD‐9 and ICD‐10 diagnosis and procedural codes are reported in Table S1 .\n\nThe primary outcome of the study was defined as the incidence of AD, based on ICD‐9 and ICD‐10 codes, starting 1 year after the index date of the aECAD diagnosis (Figure 1 ). Our study design is similar to that of recent publications. 29 , 30 , 31 To evaluate the potential benefit of CEA and CAS treatments on AD, we conducted a sensitivity analysis comparing treated and untreated individuals within the selected aECAD population. We further stratified the analyses to evaluate the effects of CEA and CAS individually on AD to account for potential differences in CEA and CAS populations. Finally, additional analyses were conducted to assess the impact of these treatments on non‐AD dementia outcomes.\n\nStatistical analyses\n\nStatistical analyses were performed between January 20, 2025 and February 20, 2025. Patient demographic characteristics (Table 1 ) and incidence statistics were analyzed using unpaired two‐tailed t tests for continuous variables and χ 2 tests for categorical variables. A two‐sided P value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant for all analyses.\n\nPropensity score matching (PSM) was conducted to balance demographic and comorbidity characteristics between patients who underwent treatment (CAS or CEA) and the control group. The PSM population accounted for potential confounding factors selected based on published literature and clinical relevance, including age at aECAD diagnosis, sex, region, and comorbidities such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), chronic kidney disease (CKD), heart failure (HF), coronary artery disease (CAD), depression (DEP), diabetes (DM), hypertension (HTN), obesity, pulmonary heart disease (PHD), tobacco use, and the Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI). Kaplan–Meier survival curves to investigate disease‐free survival between untreated, CEA, and CAS patients were created using the PSM population in the Bellwether–Pearl Diver interface.\n\nTo further investigate the individual contributions of CEA and CAS to AD risk in patients with aECAD, supplementary analyses were conducted using PSM separately for CEA and CAS.\n\nRESULTS\n\nOf the 161 million patients in the Mariner data, 4,613,981 had history of aECAD. Of these, 487,676 met the inclusion and exclusion criteria and the claims enrollment period requirements for our study (Figure 1 ). The ages of patients included in the analysis ranged between 55 and 80 years. Most patient data records in the study were from patients diagnosed with aECAD from age 55 to 77 years (Table 1 ).\n\nDemographics and comorbidities for both unadjusted and PSM populations are shown in Table 1 . Patients were stratified based on their treatment status into control (untreated) and treated (CEA and CAS procedures). In the unadjusted population, 450,359 individuals (mean [standard deviation (SD)] age at aECAD diagnosis, 67.2 [9.1] years) were controls not surgically treated, whereas 37,317 individuals (mean [SD] age at aECAD diagnosis, 66.9 [2.7] years) had a history of CEA or CAS (Table 1 ). Comorbidities were significantly different between patients undergoing intervention and those who did not (standard mean difference > 0.1; percentages were calculated on the total of 450,359 controls and 37,317 treated patients; Table 1 ).\n\nAnalyses of unadjusted population data indicated that carotid revascularization (CEA or CAS) procedures were associated with a significant decrease in the incidence of AD (19,294 of 450,359 [4.28%] vs. 1470 of 37,317 [3.94%]; relative risk [RR], 0.92; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.87–0.97; P = 0.001; Table S2 in supporting information), but not for non‐AD dementia (56,048 of 450,359 [12.45%] vs. 4610 of 37,317 [12.35%]; RR, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.97–1.02; P = 0.61; Table S3 in supporting information).\n\nPSM was computed considering age at aECAD diagnosis, region, sex, CCI rank, and the comorbidities listed in Table 1 ; 37,317 individuals (mean [SD] age at aECAD diagnosis, 67.1 [2.7] years) treated with CEA or CAS were matched with 37,317 controls (mean [SD] age at aECAD diagnosis, 66.9 [2.7] years) who did not undergo surgery (Table 1 ). Demographics and comorbidities specific to patients treated with CEA and CAS are presented in Table S4 in supporting information. These patient groups were then followed for the duration of their claims data entries and surveyed for diagnoses of AD and non‐AD dementia. The mean (SD) follow‐up time was 8.34 (2.01) years.\n\nResults of the χ 2 analysis in the PSM populations indicated that carotid revascularization (CEA or CAS) was associated with a reduced incidence of AD (1568 [4.3%] vs. 1470 [3.94%]; RR, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.87–1.01; P = 0.07), though this trend did not reach statistical significance (Figure 2 ). When stratifying the treatment group into CEA and CAS, CEA was associated with a significantly reduced risk of AD (1568 [4.3%] vs. 1357 [3.9%], RR, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.86–0.99; P = 0.04, Figure 2A and 2B ), while CAS was associated with a slight increased risk of AD that was not significant (1568 [4.3%] vs. 126 [4.43%], RR, 1.05; 95% CI, 0.88–1.26; P = 0.56, Figure 2A and 2B ).\n\nAdditional analyses evaluated the impact of CEA and CAS on non‐AD dementia. Among all patients diagnosed with non‐AD dementia ( n = 9391), the distribution included 98.2% with other or unspecified non‐AD dementias ( n = 9224), 20.4% with vascular dementia ( n = 1913), 2.6% with Lewy body dementia ( n = 241), and 1.0% with frontotemporal dementia ( n = 91; see ICD codes used in Table S1 ). Note that individuals can have mixed dementia and, therefore, be assigned to multiple non‐AD dementia diagnosis (e.g., vascular plus another subtype).\n\nFindings indicated that carotid revascularization (CEA or CAS) was associated with a reduced incidence of non‐AD dementia (4781 [12.81%] vs. 4610 [12.35%], RR, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.93–1.00; P = 0.06, Figure 3 ), but this trend did not reach statistical significance (Figure 3 ). When stratifying the treatment group into CEA and CAS, CEA was associated with significantly reduced risk (4781 [12.81%] vs. 4257 [12.23%], RR, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.92–0.99; P = 0.02, Figure 3 ), while CAS was associated with increased risk (4781 [12.81%] vs. 401 [14.10%], RR, 1.10; 95% CI, 0.88–1.26; P = 0.05, Figure 3A and 3B ). Additional analyses stratified non‐AD dementia into unspecified dementia, vascular dementia, Lewy body dementia, and frontotemporal dementia (Table S5 in supporting information). Comparing treated (CEA + CAS) versus untreated patients, no statistically significant differences were observed for any non‐AD dementia subtype (Table S5 ), consistent with our overall non‐AD dementia results (Figure 3A and 3B ). When evaluating CEA and CAS separately, the largest subgroup, unspecified dementia (98.2% of non‐AD cases), was associated with a significantly reduced risk in the group treated with CEA (RR = 0.95; 95% CI, 0.92–0.99; P = 0.02, Table S5 ), whereas CAS was not associated with risk reduction. This result is consistent with our overall non‐AD dementia findings (Figure 3B ). CEA was not associated with reduced risk for vascular dementia, Lewy body dementia, or frontotemporal dementia, and CAS subgroup analyses for Lewy body and frontotemporal dementia were not conducted due to very small sample sizes ( n < 11).\n\nPSM populations were used to generate Kaplan–Meier survival curves for AD‐free survival (Figure 4 ). Changes in the rate of AD or non‐AD dementia (Figure 4 ) incidence between patients treated with CEA or CAS and untreated patients mirror the results of the χ 2 analyses. Kaplan–Meier survival curves further stratified by age at aECAD diagnosis exhibited greater benefit of CEA on AD risk for septuagenarians (Figure S1 in supporting information).\n\nSupplementary analyses were conducted using PSM specific for CEA and CAS groups separately (Figure S2a and S3a in supporting information) to further investigate their potential differential association with dementia relative risk. CEA remained associated with significantly reduced risk (1474 [4.24%] vs. 1357 [3.90%], RR, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.86–0.99; P = 0.02, Figure S2b ), while CAS was associated with a small decreased risk that was not significant (130 [4.57%] vs. 126 [4.43%], RR, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.76–1.23; P = 0.80, Figure S3b ).\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nTreatments for AD and non‐AD dementias are highly relevant given the burden of dementia on patients, their families, and the health‐care system. 32 Growing evidence indicates that aECAD (in the absence of stroke) is associated with cognitive decline 33 , 34 , 35 and an increased risk of both AD and non‐AD dementias. 13 Despite availability of specific treatments for aECAD, which affects roughly 15% of individuals over the age of 60, there is no established clinical evaluation or treatment strategy aimed at dementia prevention. Moreover, data guiding clinical practice in this context remain limited. 14\n\nIn this retrospective population‐based study, we investigated whether CEA and/or CAS mitigate the increased AD and non‐AD dementia risk associated with aECAD. 13 Our study includes analyses of claim data of participants from across all regions of the United States with vascular comorbidity profiles (i.e., smoking, hypertension, diabetes, and lung disease) consistent with a those expected in a typical aECAD cohort. 34 , 36 Our findings indicated that CEA was associated with a statistically significant 7% to 8% ( P = 0.02) reduction in AD, whereas CAS was not associated with a statistically significant impact.\n\nPrevious research on the role of CEA or CAS in dementia prevention is limited. 37 Notably, a post hoc analysis of the Asymptomatic Carotid Surgery Trial (ACST‐1) trial ( n = 1601) evaluated dementia incidence over 20 years, comparing immediate CEA versus delayed CEA. 27 The delayed CEA cohort comprised individuals who never underwent CEA or had subsequent clinical indications for CEA. Dementia diagnoses were identified through chart evaluation or participant questionnaires by phone or mail. This study indicated there was no positive or negative benefit associated with immediate CEA on dementia prevention. However, key differences may account for this discrepancy with our findings. Importantly, the ACST‐1 trial included participants with a history of stroke and TIA and allowed for eventual CEA in the control arm; both of these factors could result in reduced observable differences between the cohorts. In total, 32% (258 out of 804) of patients in the control arm underwent subsequent CEA making it difficult to interpret the role of CEA in long‐term outcomes. Other studies examining cognitive outcomes post‐CEA resulted in mixed findings; 20 , 21 , 22 , 38 , 39 , 40 however, they did not specifically evaluate AD or dementia incidence.\n\nThe differential impact of CEA and CAS on AD risk is clinically relevant and warrants further investigation. While both procedures aim to restore carotid artery patency, their mechanisms differ: CEA directly removes atherosclerotic plaque, whereas CAS involves stent placement covering the plaque. Historically, CAS patients tend to be older and have greater comorbidities, 41 yet the PSM analyses and comparable follow‐up times (mean: 8.34 years) reduced the likelihood that these differences could impact our findings. Early dementia pathogenesis is linked to endothelial inflammation and blood–brain barrier (BBB) disruption, 42 , 43 , 44 which could be affected in patients undergoing CAS versus CEA. Previous studies suggest that CAS patients may experience significant micro‐emboli during and after a stent placement procedure, potentially degrading BBB integrity and promoting endothelial inflammation. 45 , 46 , 47 S100B, a biomarker of acute BBB injury, was shown to be elevated in CAS patients compared to those undergoing CEA, further supporting the role of BBB dysfunction after a CAS procedure. 18 Furthermore, while CEA involves direct plaque removal, which can moderate specific inflammatory cascades associated with increased plaque burden, 48 CAS does not eliminate the plaque, which could contribute to ongoing vascular and neuroinflammatory effects. Another important consideration is the technique used to perform CAS; more recent CAS procedures involve trans‐carotid artery stenting (TCAR), which has been associated with lower stroke rates than transfemoral approaches. 49 Although details were not available in Mariner data used in this study, these analyses likely included both transfemoral and TCAR procedures.\n\nOverall, our findings suggest that the type of surgical intervention (CEA vs. CAS) differentially impacts AD and non‐AD dementia risk. This is a highly relevant consideration given the recent trend toward increased CAS use. Future studies should further explore these associations using post‐procedural advanced brain imaging and prospective longitudinal analyses.\n\nStratification of non‐AD dementia into specific subtypes extended our analysis and confirmed our primary findings. The largest subgroup, unspecified dementia, indicated a significant protective association with CEA, similar in magnitude to the AD results, while CAS did not. In contrast, no significant associations were observed for vascular dementia, Lewy body dementia, or frontotemporal dementia. The absence of a CEA effect for vascular dementia may be related to our exclusion of patients with prior stroke/TIA, which likely resulted in a clinically distinct group diagnosed with imaging findings. These results suggest that the cognitive benefit of CEA in aECAD may be most pronounced in AD and unspecified dementia, rather than in vascular dementia when defined in the absence of stroke/TIA.\n\nThe main limitations of this study include: (1) the use of insurance claims data that introduced potential for missing patients who received care outside the database. To mitigate this limitation, we used PSM on a large cohort and adjusted for confounding factors that also included geographical region. (2) Clinical diagnoses of AD and non‐AD dementia were derived from claims insurance data, which does not include information on how the diagnosis was made. The Mariner database is an insurance claims dataset and therefore does not include dementia‐related clinical data such as neuropsychological test scores, functional assessments, blood‐based AD biomarkers, or neuroimaging. Although reliance on clinician diagnoses could theoretically result in some mixing of AD versus non‐AD dementia cohorts, such limitations in clinical diagnoses should affect both treated and untreated participants. Additionally, the inclusion of > 74,634 patients in both matched cohorts should mitigate this limitation. (3) The non‐treated group likely included a mixed population of individuals with moderate (50%–69%) and severe (≥ 70%) carotid stenosis as these individuals were diagnosed with aECAD but had not undergone treatment. In contrast, patients undergoing CEA or CAS were likely to have severe (≥ 70%) stenosis, making them candidates for these procedures. Because the control cohort represented individuals with less significant carotid stenosis and a milder form of vascular disease, this may result in an underestimation of the observed differences, assuming that more severe aECAD status is associated with worse neurodegenerative outcomes. Future studies should address this limitation, using datasets that enable stratification of the aECAD population by stenosis severity.\n\nIn conclusion, our study suggests that CEA may offer protection against dementia, as it was associated with decreased AD and non‐AD dementia risk in patients with aECAD, whereas CAS did not confer similar benefits. These findings have important implications for clinical decision making, emphasizing the need to consider cognitive outcomes in the management of aECAD. Future studies should be aimed at brain health outcomes, such as those that have been included in CREST‐2, 34 , 50 with a focus on identifying which subset of the large population of patients with aECAD are at highest risk for dementia and therefore may gain the most benefit.\n\nCONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n\nNone of the authors have conflicts of interest.\n\nETHICS APPROVAL\n\nAll procedures are approved by the institutional review board at the University of Arizona.\n\nCONSENT STATEMENT\n\nAll human subjects provided informed consent.\n\nSupporting information",
