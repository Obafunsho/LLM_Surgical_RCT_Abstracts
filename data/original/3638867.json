  "abstract": "Objectives: The rationale and design of the Surgical Treatment for Ischemic Heart Failure (STICH) trial is described. Prior to STICH, <1000 ischemic cardiomyopathy patients had been studied in randomized comparisons of medical therapy (MED) versus coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG). Trial data reflect how these therapies were delivered over 20 years ago and do not indicate the relative benefits of MED versus CABG in contemporary practice.\n\nMethods: Randomization of consenting patients with heart failure, left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction ≤0.35, and coronary artery disease is based on whether patients are judged by attending physicians to be candidates only for CABG or for MED or CABG. Patients eligible for surgical ventricular reconstruction (SVR) due to significant anterior wall akinesis or dyskinesis, but ineligible for MED are randomly assigned to CABG with or without SVR. Patients eligible for MED are randomly assigned between MED only and MED with CABG. Patients eligible for all 3 are randomly assigned evenly to MED only, MED and CABG, or MED and CABG and SVR. Major substudies will examine quality of life, cost-effectiveness, changes in LV volumes, impact of myocardial viability, selected biomarkers, and selected polymorphisms on treatment differences\n\nConclusions: STICH is an NHLBI-funded multicenter international randomized trial addressing 2 specific primary hypotheses: 1) CABG with intensive MED improves long-term survival compared with MED alone; and 2) in patients with anterior LV dysfunction, SVR to a more normal LV size plus CABG improves survival free of subsequent hospitalization for cardiac cause when compared with CABG alone.",
