  "abstract": "Background:: Cardiac surgery can lead to dysregulation with a proinflammatory state, resulting in adverse outcomes. Hemadsorption using the AN-69 membrane (Oxiris membrane, Baxter, USA) has the properties to chelate inflammatory cytokines. The authors hypothesized that in patients at high risk of inflammation, the use of the Oxiris membrane could decrease inflammation, preserve endothelial function, and improve postoperative outcomes.\n\nMethods:: The authors conducted a randomized single-center study at Amiens University Hospital (Amiens, France). The study population consisted of adult patients admitted for scheduled cardiac surgery with an expected cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) time greater than 90 min. The patients were allocated to either the standard group or the Oxiris group. The intervention consisted of using the Oxiris membrane on a Prismaflex device (Baxter, USA) at a blood flow rate of 450 ml/min during CPB. The primary outcome was the assessment of microcirculation on day 1 after surgery by measuring sublingual microcirculation using the microvascular flow index. Microvascular flow index reflects the microcirculation flow type and is graded from 0 to 3 as follows: 0, no flow; 1, intermittent flow; 2, sluggish flow; 3, continuous flow. The secondary outcome was a composite adverse outcome within 30 days after surgery. Cytokines and endothelial biomarkers were measured in all patients at different time points. An intention-to-treat analysis was performed.\n\nResults:: From October 2019 to November 2022, the study included 70 patients. Two patients were excluded from the Oxiris group: one patient did not undergo surgery, and one procedure was performed under deep hypothermia. The microvascular flow index did not differ between groups on day 1 from baseline: difference (95% CI) Oxiris minus standard at –0.17 (–0.44 to 0.10); P = 0.2. The occurrence of a composite adverse outcome did not significantly differ between groups (14 [42%] for the Oxiris group vs. 12 [35%] for the standard group; P = 0.7). The overall variation in cytokines and angiopoietins did not significantly differ between groups.\n\nConclusions:: In patients scheduled for a cardiac surgery with prolonged CPB, the authors could not demonstrate the benefit on microcirculation and major cardiovascular events.",

Among the keys to improving organ outcomes in cardiac surgery, the modulation of cytokines stands out. Indeed, correlations between inflammation and microcirculation are well established, with microcirculatory flow disturbances, shedding of the glycocalyx and other endothelial biomarkers, and increased capillary leak. 6 – 9 The more inflammation there is, the more the microcirculation is impaired. The clinical impact of proinflammatory cytokines, notably interleukin-6, is well documented, with an association between high cytokine values and adverse outcomes. 10 – 12\n\nBeyond the proinflammatory state, patients with a dysregulated immune response are more likely to experience adverse postoperative outcomes after major surgeries. 13 In these patients, inflammation modulation response represents a perspective to improve postoperative course. Hemadsorption techniques could represent a means to improve outcomes and attenuate an excessive proinflammatory state. 14 Among hemadsorption devices, the Oxiris membrane (Baxter, USA) has the properties to chelate various molecules in the plasma, including cytokines and complement activation, as demonstrated in vitro studies. 15 The Oxiris membrane is an AN-69 membrane, surface-treated with polyethylenimine and grafted with heparin. These properties could allow for nonselective adsorption of all cytokines, meaning both proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines. The use of the Oxiris membrane in cardiac surgery remains undetermined so far, with no reports in cardiac surgery to our knowledge. Other hemadsorption membranes have been tested in cardiac surgery with randomized controlled trials, but without evidence of benefit to our knowledge. 16 – 18 These findings conflict with a recent meta-analysis reporting a reduction in 30-day mortality. 19\n\nHere, we hypothesized that the application of the Oxiris membrane during CPB could be beneficial for patients undergoing scheduled cardiac surgery at risk of dysregulated inflammation during CPB. We proposed that these patients could benefit from the Oxiris membrane by chelating cytokines and toxic products of CPB.\n\nThe primary objective was to improve microcirculation the day after cardiac surgery. The secondary objectives were to improve clinical outcomes, report findings, and demonstrate the in vitro protection of the endothelium.\n\nMethods\n\nEthics and Study Design\n\nWe conducted a single-center, randomized, nonblind, 1:1 ratio, parallel, controlled trial at Amiens University Hospital (Amiens, France). The study protocol has been previously described. 20 The study protocol was approved by the institutional review board of Amiens University Hospital (registration identifier, 2019-A02437-50; accepted in February 2020). The study was conducted in accordance with French legislation on human clinical research. 21 Oral information was delivered and written consent was obtained before inclusion. The trial was registered on ClinicalTrials.gov on February 28, 2020 (registration identifier, NCT04201119 ).\n\nPopulation Study\n\nThe inclusion criteria were adult patients greater than 18 yr old, scheduled for cardiac surgery (aortic valve replacement, coronary artery bypass graft, mitral valve plasty or replacement, intracardiac mass removal, aortic root replacement), with an expected CPB duration greater than 90 min. The exclusion criteria were age under 18 yr old, planned hypothermia less than 32°C, emergency surgery, active endocarditis, immunosuppressive treatment or steroids (prednisone greater than 0.5 mg · kg –1 · d –1 or equivalent), human immunodeficiency virus infection with a CD4 count less than 200 mm 3 , autoimmune disease, transplant recipient, advanced chronic kidney disease (stage 4 or 5), renal replacement therapy within 90 days before surgery, known allergy to the device, history of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, and coexisting illness with a high probability of death.\n\nIntervention\n\nIn the Oxiris group, the Oxiris membrane was fitted to a dedicated Prismaflex machine (Baxter, USA) at the maximum flow rate recommended by the pharmaceutical laboratory, with a blood flow rate of 450 ml/min. The inflow of the Prismaflex (and the Oxiris membrane) was positioned between the venous line of the CPB and the reservoir, and the outflow between the venous reservoir and the head of the CPB pump. In the standard group, cardiac surgery with CPB was performed without the use of the Oxiris membrane.\n\nStandard Procedures in Both Groups\n\nCPB was conducted in line with our institutional protocol. The CPB circuit was primed with a volume of 1,400 ml (1,000 ml crystalloid and 400 ml colloid solution). CPB was performed using nonpulsatile flow at 2.5 l · min –1 · m –2 , a non–heparin-coated circuit, and a membrane oxygenator (Quadrox [Maquet, Germany] or Capiox [Terumo, Germany]). The conduct of CPB was standardized for the study with normothermia (greater than 36°C), hematocrit more than 20%, pH at 7.35 to 7.45, and a mean arterial pressure between 50 and 80 mmHg according to the most recent guidelines on CPB management. 22 , 23 Coagulation and transfusion management were performed according to European guidelines. 24 All patients received 2 g tranexamic acid during the CPB management. Anticoagulation was performed using unfractionated heparin at 400 U/kg to achieve an activated clotting time greater than 450 seconds. Heparin was reversed after CPB weaning using protamine at 1 mg for every 100 U of the initial dose of heparin.\n\nAfter surgery, all patients were admitted to a cardiac intensive care unit. Mechanical ventilation, nutrition, sedation, anticoagulation, and blood glucose control were performed according to local protocols. Hemodynamic management was standardized to achieve a cardiac index greater than 2.5 l/min, mean arterial pressure greater than 65 mmHg, and arterial lactate less than 2 mM using fluid therapy, vasopressors, and inotropic drugs.\n\nEndpoints and Definitions\n\nThe primary endpoint was the variation in microcirculation on day 1 from baseline. Microcirculation was defined by measuring the microcirculatory flow index at the sublingual site using an incident dark field imaging device (CytoCam, Braedius Medical, The Netherlands). Microcirculatory flow index is a semiquantitative method assessing the erythrocyte velocity at the microcirculation level. As recommended by the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine (Brussels, Belgium) task force in their second consensus, five video sequences of 20 s each were recorded from four different sublingual areas for each patient. 25 According to the classification of Boerma et al ., microcirculatory flow index values were recorded as follows: 0, no flow; 1, intermittent flow; 2, sluggish flow; and 3, continuous flow. The microcirculatory flow index value is the average of the four quadrants. 26 In our study, an off-record assessment of microcirculatory flow index was performed by an assessor (Y.M.) blinded to the arm allocation and to other study endpoints (supplemental video, https://links.lww.com/ALN/D834 ).\n\nThe secondary endpoints were the assessment of other parameters of microcirculation using the incident dark field imaging device from baseline to the end of CPB, on day 1 and day 2 after surgery: proportion of perfused vessels, perfused vessel density, and total vessel density; the occurrence of a composite adverse outcome within 30 days after surgery, including stroke, and type 5 myocardial infarction based on the fourth universal definition, 27 acute kidney injury defined by an increase in serum creatinine greater than 26.5 µmol/l from baseline value, 28 mesenteric ischemia, and successful resuscitated cardiac arrest.\n\nThe other endpoints were the rate of delirium using the Confusion Assesment Method–Intensive Care Unit (CAM-ICU), 29 the postoperative cumulative dose of norepinephrine (milligrams), the comparison of day 1 Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score, the intensive care unit and hospital stays (days), and 28-d mortality.\n\nPlasmatic Cytokines and Endothelial Biomarkers Measurement\n\nPeripheral blood samples were collected on intensive care unit admission in EDTA-containing tubes and centrifuged within 30 min of sampling for 10 min at 1,000 g . Plasma samples were collected and stored at –80°C until use. One anti-inflammatory cytokine (interleukin-10) and two proinflammatory cytokines (interleukin-6 second generation and tumor necrosis factor-α) were analyzed in the trial. Plasmatic levels of cytokines were analyzed in twofold diluted plasma samples using a custom Simple Plex assay panel for detection of IL-10, IL-6 second generation, and tumor necrosis factor-α second generation (kit ID, 258028, ProteinSimple, USA) by microfluidic enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay technology on the Ella Automated Immunoassay System (Bio-Techne, USA), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The interassay and intraassay coefficients of variation for tumor necrosis factor-α and interleukin-6 were all less than 9%. We also assessed endothelial biomarkers of endothelial injury: angiopoietin-1, angiopoietin-2, and tyrosine kinase with immunoglobulin 2 (Tie2). In cardiac surgery, the dysregulation in angiopoietin is well reported with a decrease in angiopoietin-1 and an increase in both angiopoietin-2 and tyrosine kinase with immunoglobulin 2. 30 That dysregulation is associated with microcirculation disturbance with a decrease in microcirculatory flow index. 31 The same technology was used for quantitative measurement of plasmatic angiopoietin-1 (Simple Plex Human Angiopoietin-1 Cartridge, second generation, SPCKB-PS-003640), angiopoietin-2 (Simple Plex Human Angiopoietin-2 Cartridge, SPCKB-PS-000244), and tyrosine kinase with immunoglobulin 2 (Simple Plex Human Tie-2, SPCKB-PS-000532) in 10-fold diluted plasma.\n\nEndothelial Cell Culture\n\nHuman umbilical vein endothelial cells were obtained from Promocell (Germany; pooled donors, C12203 ). As recommended by the manufacturer, human umbilical vein endothelial cells were grown in ECGM-2 medium containing 2.5% supplement mix (which corresponds to all media supplements; Promocell, C22011 ), named “complete ECGM-2 medium,” under standard cell culture conditions (humidified atmosphere, 5% CO 2 , 37°C). The “complete ECGM-2 medium” was changed every 2 days. Cells were passed when cell confluence reached 80 to 90%.\n\nCell Viability Assay\n\nTo measure the in vitro protective effects of Oxiris membrane on endothelium, we treated human umbilical vein endothelial cells with plasma from patients who had a CBP with or without Oxiris membrane. These plasmas were collected at baseline and at 6 h after the end of CPB. Human umbilical vein endothelial cell viability was then assessed by a colorimetric assay. In living cells, the water-soluble yellow dye is converted into an insoluble purple formazan by the action of mitochondrial reductase. Formazan is then solubilized and the concentration determined by optical density at 570 nm. Briefly, human umbilical vein endothelial cells were seeded in triplicate in a 96-well plate at 10,000 cells/well. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells were cultured in “complete ECGM-2 medium” where the 2.5% supplement mix provided by the manufacturer was replaced by 2.5% plasma from standard group patients (n = 15) or 2.5% plasma from Oxiris group patients (n = 15). The medium was removed every 2 days. After 6 days, the dye was added to each well and incubated for 2 h at 37°C. Then, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and incubated with dimethyl sulfoxide at 37°C with gentle shaking for 1 h. Absorbance was measured by a microplate reader (Tecan, Switzerland) at 570 nm with a reference wavelength of 650 nm, according to the manufacturer’s instructions.\n\nRandomization\n\nPatients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio into two parallel open-label groups, with no stratification. Randomization was conducted using Clinsight (Sweden) software, implemented by a data manager. To ensure balance between each group, random block sizes of 10 were generated.\n\nSample Size Calculation\n\nBased on a previous study, the expected baseline value in cardiac surgery of microcirculatory flow index is 2.8 ± 0.5. 32 To achieve a power of 80% with an alpha risk of 5%, we estimated a sample size of 70 patients (35 per arm) to detect a difference of 0.4 in microcirculatory flow index value on day 1.\n\nStatistical Analysis\n\nData were presented as median [interquartile range] or as numbers (percentage) according to the variable type. The primary analysis was performed using a predefined linear mixed model, including the arm of allocation (Oxiris or standard arm) and baseline microcirculatory flow index adjustment variable. Categorical secondary outcomes were compared between groups using a chi-square or a Fisher exact test. Repeated measures of cytokines and endothelial injury markers were compared between groups using a linear mixed model including arm, time, and an interaction between arm and time as fixed effects; the random effect concerned patient number with a random intercept. Continuous secondary outcomes were compared between groups using a Student’s t test. An intention-to-treat analysis was performed. To account for multiple testing, P values for secondary endpoints were adjusted using the Hochberg method. A P value under 0.05 was considered significant. Statistical analyses were performed using R software (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria), version 2024.04.1 + 748.\n\nResults\n\nParticipants and Flow Chart\n\nFrom October 2019 to November 2022, 70 patients were randomized in the study (table 1 and fig. 1 ). After randomization, two patients in the Oxiris group were excluded: one procedure under deep hypothermia and one procedure cancellation. A total of 33 and 35 patients were analyzed, respectively, for the Oxiris and standard groups.\n\nBriefly, patients were mainly men, with a median age of 78 yr in both groups. The main surgery type was combined surgery (respectively for the Oxiris and standard groups, 12 [36%] and 13 [41%]). The median Euroscore II was 1.19% [0.94; 1.58] and 1.00% [0.76; 1.58], respectively, for the Oxiris and the standard groups. The median time of CPB was 127 min [97; 154] and 128 min [97; 154], respectively, for the Oxiris and the standard groups.\n\nMain Endpoint\n\nAfter adjustment for the baseline value of microcirculatory flow index, the increase in microcirculatory flow index induced by the Oxiris membrane was not significant between groups on day 1 after surgery: change in microcirculatory flow index at 0.17 [–0.10; 0.44]; P = 0.20. On day 1, microcirculatory flow index was 2.17 [1.83; 2.46] and 1.92 [1.58; 2.22], P = 0.2, respectively, for the Oxiris and the standard groups.\n\nThe between-group comparison in microcirculatory flow index from baseline to day 1 after surgery did not significantly differ ( P = 0.2163). The evolution between groups is presented in figure 2 .\n\nOther parameters of sublingual microcirculation are presented in supplemental file 1 ( https://links.lww.com/ALN/D835 ). The evolution of perfused vessel density, proportion of perfused vessels, and total vessel density did not differ between groups from baseline to day 2 after surgery.\n\nSecondary Endpoints\n\nSecondary endpoints are presented in table 2 . Postoperative outcomes did not significantly differ between groups, notably for the rate of composite adverse outcome (42% vs. 35% for the Oxiris and standard groups, respectively; P = 0.5). We did not find a significant difference in the occurrence of delirium, the rate of postoperative atrial fibrillation, and the rate of postoperative pulmonary complications. No difference in 28-day mortality was found: one (3%) vs. zero (0%), respectively, for the Oxiris and standard groups ( P = 0.5).\n\nThe cumulative dose of norepinephrine was similar between groups, with doses of 0.16 [0.11; 0.31] and 0.46 [0.23; 0.73], respectively, for the Oxiris and standard groups ( P = 0.068).\n\nCytokines and Endothelial Injury\n\nPlasma levels of tumor necrosis factor -α, IL-6, and IL-10 are presented in figure 2 and supplemental file 2 ( https://links.lww.com/ALN/D836 ). The levels of tumor necrosis factor -α, interleukin-6, and interleukin-10 did not significantly differ from baseline to day 2 after surgery between groups.\n\nRegarding endothelial injury, a dysregulation in angiopoietins was observed with an increase in the Ang2/Ang1 ratio; no between-group difference was found ( P = 0.3620) as reported in figure 2 and supplemental file 3 ( https://links.lww.com/ALN/D837 ). An endothelial injury was observed with an increase in angiopoietin-2 and a decrease in both tyrosine kinase with immunoglobulin 2 and angiopoietin-1 with no significant difference between groups as presented in figure 3 and supplemental file 3 ( https://links.lww.com/ALN/D837 ).\n\nEndothelial Viability\n\nHuman umbilical vein endothelial cell treatment with plasma from the Oxiris group did not show a significant protective effect on cell viability compared to treatment with plasma from the standard group as reported in figure 4 .\n\nSensitivity Analysis\n\nThe effect of baseline interleukin-10, baseline tumor necrosis factor-α, erythrocyte transfusion, baseline microcirculatory flow index, and arm allocation was assessed in a mixed model effect on microcirculatory flow index variation at day 1. We did not find any statistical influence of theses variables on the variation in primary endpoint (supplemental file 4, https://links.lww.com/ALN/D838 )\n\nDiscussion\n\nIn our trial assessing the use of the Oxiris membrane in scheduled cardiac surgery, we failed to demonstrate a benefit regarding the preservation of microcirculation and the prevention of adverse outcomes (table 2 ). The clearance of proinflammatory (interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-α) or anti-inflammatory (interleukin-10) cytokines was also similar between groups. Endothelial injury could not be prevented, as reflected by the increase in angiopoietin-2 and the decrease in both tyrosine kinase with immunoglobulin 2 and angiopoietin-1. Last, the coincubation of human umbilical vein endothelial cells with plasma treated with the Oxiris membrane did not show protection in terms of human umbilical vein endothelial cell viability.\n\nAlthough cardiac surgery is known to induce a proinflammatory state and a production of cytokines, evidence is lacking on the benefit of its treatment. As hypothesized, we expected to decrease the proinflammatory state related to cardiac surgery and CPB. Beyond inflammation control, we expected to improve microcirculation and postoperative outcomes. When looking at previous trials in cardiac surgery, most reported findings similar to ours, with the absence of cytokine clearance and the absence of clinical benefits. 18 , 33 Indeed, in two randomized trials, the authors failed to decrease cytokine levels with hemadsorption. These results could be explained by various factors: small sample size (around 30 patients) and low risk of inflammation. In our trial, we tried to compensate for these limitations with a larger sample size and by selecting patients at risk of inflammation with a long CPB time. To our knowledge, only one large randomized trial has reported efficiency in cytokine hemadsorption in cardiac surgery. 16 In the Revealing Mechanisms and Investigating Efficacy of Hemoadsorption for Prevention of Vasodilatory Shock in Cardiac Surgery Patients With Infective Endocarditis (REMOVE) trial, the authors randomized 288 patients in a multicenter trial in Germany. Despite including patients at risk of inflammation ( i.e. , endocarditis), no benefit was observed in postoperative severity or mortality, but the authors did observe decreased cytokine levels.\n\nNevertheless, to explain all these negative results, we believe that all these trials, including ours, share common limitations. First, the hemadsorption treatment duration might be insufficient. Indeed, treatment was limited to the CPB duration. So far, no study has assessed a prolonged time of hemadsorption during postoperative care. As shown in figure 3 , the peak of cytokines is around 6 h after surgery, suggesting that the peak of inflammation is delayed from the surgical time. A study assessing the Oxiris membrane in patients with refractory cardiogenic shock is ongoing and will provide answers on the hypothetical effect of prolonged treatment. 34 Second, we believe the whole blood might not have been adequately treated with the membrane. In our trial, the pump flow rate of the Oxiris membrane was set at 450 ml/min. Additionally, blood samples were collected from the patient and not from the Prismaflex device. To assess the clearance of cytokines, we should have collected blood from the arterial and venous lines of the Prismaflex device. However, we believe that clearing cytokines in the patient is more important than focusing on clearance within the Prismaflex circuit.\n\nRegarding the cytokine levels in our trial, the real risk of inflammation is questionable. Indeed, the peak level of interleukin-6 is around 160 pg/ml, as shown in supplemental file 2 ( https://links.lww.com/ALN/D836 ) and figure 3 . When compared to the REMOVE trial, which had a peak of 400 pg/ml interleukin-6, it suggests that our population was not at as high a risk of inflammation. 16 Furthermore, when looking at other acute inflammatory states, such as acute respiratory distress syndrome, the level of interleukin-6 is greater than 1,000 pg/ml. 35 Beyond the issue of high-risk inflammation, the threshold for pathologic values of cytokines remains unknown to date. Despite various studies on the topic, no one defined threshold value. Last, apart from hemadsorption therapies, large randomized trials were conducted with others therapies to target inflammation without any benefit in comparison to standard care, leaving the issue unresolved. 36 – 38\n\nApart from inflammation, we expected to protect the endothelium and preserve microcirculation. Most studies in cardiac surgery report an increase in angiopoietin-2 and a decrease in both angiopoietin-1 and tyrosine kinase with immunoglobulin 2. 39 , 40 In healthy subjects, angiopoietin-1 binds to tyrosine kinase with immunoglobulin 2 and allows the preservation of endothelial architecture. 41 During inflammation, there is an overexpression of angiopoietin-2, which binds excessively to tyrosine kinase with immunoglobulin 2, leading to the loss of endothelial architecture and an increase in capillary permeability. 42 Angiopoietin dysregulation is often associated with microcirculation disturbances. 8\n\nFor these reasons, we assessed sublingual microcirculation. However, given the absence of cytokine clearance in our trial, we could not have expected an improvement in microcirculation.\n\nOur trial has some limitations. As aforementioned, we believe that blood samples should have been collected from the Prismaflex arterial and venous lines just before and after the membrane. This approach would have provided a more accurate assessment of the membrane’s function.\n\nAnother limitation is the absence of selection of patients at high risk of inflammation. While inflammation is expected in all patients after cardiac surgery, adverse outcomes are more likely to occur in severe proinflammatory states or when there is a dysregulation between pro- and anti-inflammatory states. This last statement is supported by a recent report that highlighted a phase of immunodepression that might occur after CPB. 43 Monitoring the expression of HLA-DR on monocytes offers the perspective to detect this immunodepression. 44\n\nThe final limitation concerns the study power. The power is probably underpowered to adequately account for the multifactorial effects of CPB. Moreover, when considering the pooled SD of microcirculatory flow index, the value is higher than the expected value of 0.5 reported in the sample size section. Hence, caution is warranted in the interpretation of our data given that limited statistical power. We aimed to investigate endothelial function in greater depth, along with other descriptions as reported in the trial declaration on ClinicalTrials.gov. However, given the absence of study findings, we discontinued further investigations.\n\nWe believe that further trials should take into account these dysregulations in inflammation and should consider a prolonged period of hemadsorption treatment in these highly selected patients.\n\nConclusions\n\nThe use of the Oxiris membrane in prolonged cardiac surgery did not prevent microcirculation impairment or postoperative adverse outcomes. Further investigations should focus on patients at high risk of inflammation through cytokine monitoring.\n\nResearch Support\n\nThe Oxicard trial was supported by Baxter Healthcare Corporation (Deerfield, Illinois; Baxter Acute Therapies grant program 2019 19CECACEU1002).
