Although the benefits of transplantation are numerous, risks and complications also accompany this life-changing therapy. One complication that occurs after kidney transplantation is posttransplant diabetes mellitus (PTDM). Diabetes mellitus carries risk of future development of infectious complications, cardiovascular disease, decreased allograft survival, and increased patient mortality. 1 – 4\n\nHistorically, new diagnoses of diabetes mellitus affect up to 15% to 50% of posttransplant patients. 5 , 6 Known risk factors for PTDM include family history of diabetes, age, obesity, genetic predisposition, impaired insulin release, impaired insulin uptake by muscle and adipose tissues, and impaired suppression of glucagon release. Transplant-specific factors associated with development of PTDM include hepatitis C and cytomegalovirus infections, polycystic kidney disease history, and use of immunosuppressant medications such as corticosteroids and calcineurin inhibitors. 4 , 7 , 8 Corticosteroids lead to increased gluconeogenesis and decreased glycogen synthesis by the liver, increase lipolysis and triglyceride release from adipose tissue, increase central and visceral adiposity, and decrease glucose uptake by muscles. Calcineurin inhibitors lead to impaired glucose tolerance and diabetes through decreased insulin gene expression and induction of islet cell apoptosis. 4 , 8\n\nThe majority of patients who are not previously diabetic may develop new PTDM in the first 3 mo after a transplant. 8 – 10 Conversion from hyperglycemia to PTDM is not fully predictable, and prevention of new PTDM is paramount in a population that faces other health concerns.\n\nThe stresses of surgery, along with high-initial doses of corticosteroids to promote graft acceptance and higher calcineurin inhibitor doses to help avoid early rejection, are contributing factors. Patients documented to have impaired glucose tolerance by the oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) pretransplant are at greater risk of developing new PTDM posttransplant. 11 Performing this test routinely is not done because of logistics and costs because candidates can spend years on the kidney transplant waiting list. Hyperglycemia in the very early postkidney transplant period is very common, with a reported rate of 90%. Nondiabetics with significant hyperglycemia (blood glucose >200 mg/dL) during the first week posttransplant have higher rates of newly diagnosed PTDM. 6 Although labs are monitored frequently in the early posttransplant period and recognition of hyperglycemia is apparent, there are limited strategies to prevent the development of new PTDM. Rapid tapering of corticosteroids and lowering calcineurin inhibitor levels may not occur early posttransplant because of the concern for acute rejection.\n\nPrevious investigators have used various medications to treat posttransplant diabetes mellitus, including metformin, insulin, and dipeptidyl-peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors. 12 – 14 One notable study has attempted to prevent PTDM through isophane insulin use within the first 12 mo posttransplant. 12 Although effective at preventing PTDM compared with standard-of-care at 12 mo, there were incidences of asymptomatic hypoglycemia in the insulin-treated group. 12 There have been no studies to our knowledge using DPP-2 inhibitors starting the first week of transplant to prevent PTDM in previously nondiabetic transplant recipients. Sitagliptin, an orally active antidiabetic agent, is part of the family of DPP-4 inhibitors. Normally, endogenous incretin hormones, glucagon-like peptide (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) are rapidly inactivated by DPP-4. DPP-4 inhibitors work by inhibiting plasma DPP-4 function, thus allowing increased levels of incretin hormones GLP-1 and GIP in the postprandial setting. This potentiates glucose stimulated insulin production and release and slows glucagon release without causing hypoglycemia. 15 , 16 In diabetic animal models, it has led to improvement in beta cell function and neogenesis. 17 The lack of hypoglycemia and other manifestations of gastrointestinal side effects makes DPP-4 inhibitors generally well tolerated among patients. A prospective study has shown that treatment of PTDM with sitagliptin was effective in lowering hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) in kidney transplant patients with new onset diabetes after transplant and importantly did not alter calcineurin inhibitor levels. 18 To our knowledge, the use of sitagliptin for prevention of new PTDM has not been described in the literature. Given its mechanism of action and safety profile, we hypothesized that sitagliptin is an ideal pharmacologic agent to prevent new PTDM in the first 3 mo of transplant.\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\n\nStudy Design and Subjects\n\nThis was a single-center, randomized, double-blind, and placebo-controlled trial in kidney transplant recipients to evaluate the role of sitagliptin in the prevention of PTDM. Participants in the trial provided written informed consent. The trial adhered to the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. The study was approved by the Washington University in Saint Louis institutional review board (IRB ID no. 201306111 and registered NCT number NCT01928199 ).\n\nAll adults aged 18 y or older who received a living or deceased kidney allograft after July 25, 2013, were evaluated for inclusion. Those without a history of diabetes were screened for postoperative hyperglycemia (random blood glucose >200 mg/dL) within the first 72 h following transplantation. In June 2015, the inclusion time point was expanded to 120 h posttransplant based on the finding that there were patients who screened positive outside the initial 72 h. Exclusion criteria included a history of diabetes including diet-controlled diabetes; history of insulin or oral hypoglycemic agent use before transplant; inclusion of the patient being placed on medication then taken off as a result of improved glycemic control; HbA1c ≥6.5% immediately before transplant; recipient of simultaneous kidney-pancreas, kidney-liver, kidney-heart, or kidney-lung transplant; or history of prior nonrenal transplant.\n\nStudy Procedures\n\nThose that screened positive for postoperative hyperglycemia were approached to participate in the study. Once consented, patients were randomized by the research pharmacist by block randomization to receive sitagliptin or placebo, and they kept record of patient allocation, whereas the rest of the study team and participants remained blinded. Placebo tablets were provided that looked identical in shape, color, and size to a 25-mg sitagliptin tablet. Randomization was based upon a stratification of pretransplant HbA1c (<5.7% or 5.7%–6.4%). The target enrollment was 50 patients but was later extended to 61 patients to account for drop out and loss to follow-up. After randomization, patients continued on the study drug, adjusted for renal function for 3 mo. At 3 mo’ time, the study drug was discontinued, and patients were followed for an additional 3 mo off the study drug.\n\nParticipants had outpatient study visits at 1 mo, 3 mo, and 6 mo after discharge. Patients were instructed to monitor their blood glucose at least 1 time per day via finger stick glucometer; however, monitoring of fasting blood glucose and 2 h after the largest meal of the day was requested. At the 1-mo and 3-mo visit, an investigator reviewed the blood glucose logs and assessed for adverse effects. Additionally, at the 3-mo study visit, HbA1c, 2-h OGTT blood glucose, and fasting C-peptide level were obtained. Following discontinuation of the study medication at the 3-mo study visit, participants had a 6-mo study visit where repeat HbA1c, 2-h OGTT blood glucose, and fasting C-peptide level were obtained.\n\nIn addition to the monitoring for the study described above, patients obtained routine posttransplant laboratory monitoring including a complete blood count, renal panel, and tacrolimus trough level. Labs were assessed per center protocol twice weekly for 2 wks, weekly between 2 through 12 wks, and every 2 wks for the duration of the study.\n\nElevated blood glucose readings were assessed by the study investigators. Diagnosis and treatment of diabetes was in accordance with published guidelines with the exception that add-on therapy to the study medication could not include use of a DPP-4 inhibitor because the investigators were blinded to the randomized arm.\n\nPrimary and Secondary Endpoints\n\nThe primary efficacy objective was to assess the efficacy of sitagliptin to improve 2-h OGTT by >20 mg/dL at 3 mo posttransplant in patients without preexisting diabetes undergoing living-donor or deceased-donor kidney transplant compared with placebo. The secondary efficacy objective was to assess the efficacy of sitagliptin to prevent new onset posttransplant diabetes mellitus as determined by a normal OGTT at 3 mo posttransplant in patients without preexisting diabetes undergoing living-donor or deceased-donor kidney transplant compared with placebo. The primary efficacy endpoint was a difference in 2-h OGTT blood glucose of ≥20 mg/dL assessed at the 3-mo study visit. For reference, a normal fasting glucose is <100 mg/dL; at 2 h, the expected normal value of glucose for an OGTT is <140 mg/dL; 140 mg/dL to 199 mg/dL indicates impaired glucose tolerance; and a value >200 mg/dL is diagnostic of diabetes mellitus. These levels were compared with the values at the 6-mo study visit. The secondary endpoint assessed in this study was the attainment of a normal 2-h OGTT blood glucose at 3 mo in the study group compared with placebo. Other outcomes included the improvement of HbA1c by ≥0.5% between groups, differences between fasting OGTT blood glucose, fasting blood glucose, postprandial blood glucose, fasting C-peptide, and fasting insulin within the groups from the end of treatment compared with the end of the observation period. Assessments of graft function and immunosuppression serum levels were also assessed between study groups.\n\nMaintenance Immunosuppression\n\nMaintenance immunosuppression was standardized and included administration of methylprednisolone 7 mg/kg on the day of transplant followed by oral prednisone 1 mg/kg (maximum 80 mg) on postoperative days (PODs) 1 and 2 followed by 20 mg daily for 10 d, 15 mg daily for 7 d, 10 mg daily for 7 d, and then 5 mg daily thereafter. Tacrolimus was initiated on POD 1 and adjusted to a target tacrolimus trough level of 7 to 10 ng/mL for 1 mo, then 3 to 7 ng/mL for the remainder of the study period. Mycophenolate sodium was initiated at 720 mg BID and reduced to 360 mg BID once the target tacrolimus trough level was achieved.\n\nStatistical Analysis\n\nDemographic and admission variables were compared between groups using the 2-sample t test or Mann-Whitney U test for continuous variables as appropriate. Categorical variables were tested using the chi-square test or Fisher’s exact test as appropriate. Analysis was based on the intention-to-treat principle. Efficacy outcomes were defined as change from month 3 to month 6. Mean change of outcomes was compared between groups using the 2-sample t test. All statistical tests were 2-sided at significance level 0.05, and analyses were performed with SAS, version 9.4 (SAS Inc, Cary, NC).\n\nSample Size Calculation\n\nBased on a sample size of 25 patients per group, this study has 80.7% power to detect a mean difference of 20 mg/dL in 2-h OGTT based on the 2-sample t test at significance level 0.05. The calculation assumes a SD of 25 mg/dL or less between groups. 19\n\nRESULTS\n\nIn total, 61 patients consented to be in the study, 32 in the sitagliptin arm and 29 in the placebo arm. CONSORT flow diagram Figure 1 indicates enrollment and follow-up for the study. By the end of study, 27 patients in the sitagliptin arm and 23 patients in the placebo arm completed at least the 3- or 6-mo visit for inclusion in the efficacy analyses. Table 1 shows baseline characteristics between the 2 groups. There were no differences in sex, race, cause of end-stage renal disease, type of transplant, or comorbidities between the groups. The mean baseline HbA1c in the sitagliptin and placebo arms was 5.27% (+0.46%) and 5.13% (+0.41%) ( P = 0.23), respectively. The mean participant body mass index at study entry was 28.82 kg/m 2 + 4.58 in the sitagliptin group and 29.40 kg/m 2 + 4.27 in the placebo group ( P = 0.6133). The time of day for the qualifying blood glucose >200 mg/dL was divided between midnight to 8:00 AM, 8:01 to 4:00 PM, and 4:01 PM through midnight. Nineteen patients (31.15%) qualified during the midnight to 8:00 AM time period, another 15 patients (24.59%) qualified during the 8:01 AM to 4:00 PM time point, and 27 patients (44.26%) had qualifying blood glucoses levels during the 4:01 PM through midnight time period. Table 1 shows the time points where patients qualified separated between study groups.\n\nPrimary and Secondary Efficacy Analysis\n\nPrimary Efficacy Analysis\n\nThe 3-mo 2-h OGTT at the end of study drug treatment duration was 141.00 ± 62.44 mg/dL in the sitagliptin arm and 165.22 ± 72.03 mg/dL in the placebo arm, with a difference of 24.22 mg/dL ( P = 0.218). This was not statistically significant. The sitagliptin arm mean 2-h OGTT was just above the normal cutoff of 139 mg/dL for a normal OGTT. The 6-mo 2-h OGTT was 174.38 ± 77.93 mg/dL in the sitagliptin arm and 171.86 ± 83.69 ng/dL ( P = 0.918) in the placebo arm. Figure 2 depicts the 2-h OGTT for months 3 and 6 for placebo and sitagliptin groups. The mean intrapatient difference between months 3 and 6, 2-h OGTT (6-mo OGTT–3-mo OGTT) was 27.56 + 52.74 in the sitagliptin arm and −0.14 + 45.80 in the placebo arm ( P = 0.0692). Table 2 shows the findings of the primary efficacy analysis.\n\nSecondary Efficacy Analysis\n\nThe percentage of patients in the sitagliptin and placebo arms at 3 mo with a normal 2-h OGTT was 61.54% and 43.48% ( P = 0.2678) with the absolute risk reduction 18.06%. At 6 mo, when both groups had a 3-mo washout period without the study drug, the percentage of patients in the sitagliptin and placebo arms with a normal 2-h OGTT was 41.67% and 47.62%, respectively ( P = 0.900).\n\nNo difference was seen in HbA1c between treatment groups at the end of the treatment period or at the end of the follow-up period. Comparing sitagliptin versus placebo, at 3 mo, the HbA1c was 5.52% ± 0.58% versus 5.78% ± 0.85% ( P = 0.2333), and at 6 mo, the HbA1c was 5.91% ± 0.84% versus 5.79% ± 0.69% ( P = 0.5998). The absolute mean difference in HbA1c between 3 and 6 mo (6 mo–3 mo) was 0.39% and 0.01% ( P = 0.0568) in the sitagliptin and placebo groups, respectively. Figure 3 illustrates the change in HbA1c between 3 and 6 mo for placebo and sitagliptin groups.\n\nGlycemic Outcomes\n\nFasting OGTT, average fasting blood glucose, average postprandial blood glucose, and fasting insulin and fasting C-peptide values at the 3- and 6-mo time points, as well as OGTT results divided between normal, impaired glucose tolerance and diabetes, are shown in Table 3 . There were no significant mean or proportion differences in these outcomes. Figure 4 illustrates the fasting OGTT change from months 3 to 6 for placebo and sitagliptin groups.\n\nOne month into study participation, 2 patients in the sitagliptin arm and 3 patients in the placebo arm became diabetic and required additional medication to treat hyperglycemia. By the 3-mo follow-up, a total of 3 patients in the sitagliptin arm and 5 patients in the placebo arm were already identified as diabetic, requiring additional medication to treat hyperglycemia. Additional patients were identified at the time of the 3 mo follow-up OGTT. At the final 6-mo follow-up, a total of 5 in the sitagliptin group and 6 in the placebo group were diabetic and required additional medication to treat hyperglycemia, with additional patients identified at the time of the 6-mo OGTT. Medications used to treat these patients for diabetes included metformin, sulfonylureas, and insulin.\n\nSafety Outcomes\n\nOverall, the study medication was well tolerated. Both groups had similar renal function and tacrolimus levels through the follow-up period (Table 4 ). No patients experienced acute cellular or antibody mediated rejection or allograft failure during the follow-up. Three patients had serious adverse events by month 3 in both the sitagliptin arm and the placebo arm (11.54% versus 13.04%, P = 0.8729). Events included a urine leak with need for surgical intervention, volume overload, and right arm weakness in the sitagliptin group. In the placebo group, 1 patient had a hernia repair, another had shortness of breath, and another underwent elective bilateral native nephrectomies. There were 2 additional patients with serious adverse events by month 6 in the sitagliptin arm and one in the placebo arm (7.41% versus 5%, P = 0.7414). This included admission for nausea and vomiting and a ureteral stricture, respectively. However, no patients discontinued study medication in either group because of adverse effects. Events were unlikely to be related to side effects from the study drug.\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nTo the best of our knowledge, our study is the first randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the use of sitagliptin initiated at the time of transplant to prevent the development of PTDM in kidney transplant recipients without preexisting diabetes but who had early posttransplant hyperglycemia. We used a medication class that would be beneficial in this population given its mechanism of action, lack of interaction with immunosuppressants, and low risk of hypoglycemia or other adverse effects. Posttransplant use of DPP-4 inhibitors has been examined in prior studies. A study conducted by Lane et al evaluated sitagliptin in 15 patients who were on average 4.7 years out from transplant but developed diabetes posttransplant. 20 They showed that sitagliptin was effective in lowering the HbA1c without affecting immunosuppression levels for tacrolimus or sirolimus. Werzowa et al explored the use of vildagliptin or pioglitazone in comparison to placebo over a 3-mo period in 48 renal transplant patients at least 6 months posttransplant. 21 Vildagliptin, pioglitazone, or placebo were initiated in patients who were found to have impaired glucose tolerance with OGTT (2-h OGTT result 140 mg/dL to 199 mg/dL), and given treatment for 3 mo. The investigators found that vildagliptin and pioglitazone improved 2-h OGTT in patients with impaired glucose tolerance at least 6 mo out from transplant, although the difference in change in 2-h OGTT was not statistically significant. In a follow-up randomized controlled trial, Haidinger et al compared vildagliptin to placebo in stable posttransplant patients at least 6 mo posttransplant who were newly diagnosed with PTDM through routine OGTT testing (2-h OGTT > 200 mg/dL). They found that vildagliptin improved 2-h OGTT results and HgbA1c levels compared with placebo. 13 Our trial used sitagliptin within the first week posttransplant to improve glycemic control when blood glucose levels were elevated because of the physical stress of transplant surgery and medications that increase blood glucose.\n\nThere is only 1 other study to our knowledge that sought to treat early hyperglycemia posttransplantation with the intention of reducing PTDM. This randomized trial compared early postoperative intermediate acting (isophane) insulin (treatment group) with treatment using short-acting insulin and oral sulfonylurea (control/standard-of-care group) according to consensus treatment guidelines, with the primary endpoint being the difference in HbA1c at 3 mo. 12 Medications were titrated up or down based on blood glucose levels recorded the evening prior. Although the HbA1c increased from a baseline obtained at the time of transplant for both groups, the investigators found that, at 3 mo, there was a lower mean difference in HbA1c of 0.52% in the treatment isophane insulin group compared with standard-of-care (control). Five patients experienced asymptomatic hypoglycemia, defined in the study as blood glucose 41 to 60 mg/d, in the treatment group compared with 1 patient as the control group. Although the strategy of early tight blood glucose control early after transplant seemed to help prevent long-term PTDM, hypoglycemia remains a significant concern in newly transplanted patients when medications are changing regularly, particularly in patients new to insulin who may not be fully aware of the symptoms associated with hypoglycemia. An advantage of our study design was to use a DDP-4 inhibitor with a low risk of hypoglycemia. We did not observe any incidence of hypoglycemia in our study.\n\nThe kidney transplant population is a unique group of patients because their risk of newly diagnosed diabetes mellitus posttransplant is greatest at the beginning of transplant. Perhaps the most well-known diabetes prevention study in the general population is the Diabetes Prevention Program, which studied standard lifestyle recommendations plus placebo, standard lifestyle recommendations plus metformin, or intensive lifestyle modification over the course of 2.8 y. 22 The incidence of diabetes was reduced by 58% in the intensive lifestyle modification and 31% in the metformin group compared with placebo. 22 These methods have limitations, preventing implementation in the early posttransplant period because of fluctuating and oftentimes elevated Cr in the first several weeks after transplant and thus the inability to prescribe metformin early on, and patients are unable to tolerate moderately intensive exercise in the early part of their transplant because of recent surgery.\n\nThe primary objective of our study was to assess sitagliptin ability to improve 2-h OGTT by ≥20 mg/dL at 3 mo posttransplant. We observed a lower 2-h OGTT in the sitagliptin group (141.00 ± 62.44) than in the placebo group (165.22 ± 72.03); although this was not statistically significant ( P = 0.218), it may be clinically significant and paralleled the reported average blood sugar 2-h postprandial at 3 mo (sitagliptin 140.00 ± 24.34 and placebo 162.13 ± 51.93, P = 0.4451). After discontinuation of the study drug at 3 mo, there was no difference between sitagliptin or placebo arms in 2-h OGTT at 6 mo posttransplant (sitagliptin 174.38 mg/dL ± 77.93 versus placebo 171.86 mg/dL ± 83.69), with a mean increase in HbA1c between 3 and 6 mo of 0.39% in the sitagliptin arm compared with 0.01% in the placebo arm ( P = 0.0568). The secondary objective of this study was to assess sitagliptin ability to prevent new onset PTDM at 3 mo versus placebo. We found that 61.54% of the sitagliptin arm has a normal 2-h OGTT at 3 mo (2-h BS <−140 mg/dL) compared with 43.48% of the placebo arm, not reaching statistical significance ( P = 0.2062). Notably, more patients in the sitagliptin arm required treatment for diabetes by the 6 mo OGTT, suggesting that they may have derived some benefit to blood glucose lowering with the sitagliptin. Given the lack of meeting statistical significance for both the primary and secondary objectives of this study, our findings were ultimately negative.\n\nOur study was limited by sample size, and findings can be useful to power a future study. Although the HbA1c test can be affected by anemia and renal function, which can fluctuate within the first several months after transplant, we evaluated the baseline and 3- and 6-mo Hgb levels and serum creatinine and mean tacrolimus levels and found no significant difference between the sitagliptin and placebo groups (Table 4 ). The use of OGTT as the primary test for patients in this study was used because both anemia and renal functions affect HbA1c, and our goal was to use a test that was not affected by labs that may be fluctuating as we performed our study procedures. However, patients in the study did have their first OGTT on the last day of taking their study drug, and thus, those on the sitagliptin would be expected to have a lower OGTT.\n\nThere is evidence from prior studies that poor glycemic control early posttransplant is associated with increased risk of perioperative infections. 4 , 23 – 24 Although this current study did not specifically evaluate for a difference in early posttransplant infections related to hyperglycemia, no significant infections were reported. It is not clear whether continuing patients on the study drug through the first 6 mo would provide benefit in prevention of new onset PTDM or impaired glucose tolerance. Withdrawal of sitagliptin at the 3-mo follow-up led to an increase in the 2-h OGTT and HbA1c for the intervention patients, indicating a potential benefit of extending sitagliptin. The advantage of sitagliptin is the lack of hypoglycemic episodes, ease of use and tolerability by patients with minimal side effects, decreased morbidity with respect to infectious complications, and lack of potential interaction with immunosuppression. We believe our study, although not showing statistical significance, can better inform future studies that evaluate the management of posttransplant hyperglycemia in patients with no preexisting diabetes.",
