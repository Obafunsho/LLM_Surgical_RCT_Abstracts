  "abstract": "The challenging management of coagulation in cardiothoracic surgery requires a multifaceted approach. The use of pharmacological interventions such as tranexamic acid, heparin, and aprotinin minimizes bleeding but increases the associated risks of renal impairment and seizures. However, aprotinin has been replaced by tranexamic acid for safety reasons. Supplementing nonpharmacological techniques, such as hemostatic agents and mechanical devices, with these pharmacological strategies can enhance surgical coagulation management. During cardiopulmonary bypass, factors such as hypothermia, acidosis, and fibrinolysis worsen coagulation disturbances, and protamine sulfate is administered for heparin reversal during the procedure. Point-of-care devices, including thromboelastography (TEG®) and rotational thromboelastometry (ROTEM®), provide real-time monitoring of coagulation, hence guiding clinical interventions effectively, and have demonstrated a reduction in postoperative bleeding. Nonetheless, tailored approaches are critical, especially in patients with preexisting coagulation disorders as well as in pediatric surgery. Pharmacogenomics also plays a role in selecting appropriate dosages and minimizing adverse outcomes. Recent advancements in this context include novel hemostatic agents, prothrombin complex concentrates, and direct oral anticoagulants. Future research should not only explore the combined use of pharmacological and nonpharmacological strategies but also evaluate the long-term effects and cost-effectiveness of integrated approaches during cardiothoracic surgery, particularly in high-risk populations.",

  "full_text": "Introduction/background: the challenge of coagulation management in cardiothoracic surgery\n\nManaging coagulation in cardiothoracic procedures is challenging, as a balance between hemostasis and anticoagulation must be maintained. Over the past few decades, patient blood management (PBM) has been used as a significant perioperative approach to minimize transfusions, as it is crucial for managing coagulation in such patients. However, implementing PBM in cardiac surgery has barriers due to complexities, economic burdens, quality monitoring, and resistance to change. Other barriers are preoperative anemia and untimely discontinuation of anticoagulants [ 1 ]. Intraoperative vascular injuries in both open cardiac surgery and thoracoscopic surgeries, mostly pulmonary artery injuries, are a major challenge, making hemostasis crucial [ 2 ]. Cardiac surgeries, especially those involving valve interventions, carry a significant risk of vascular injury due to the proximity of coronary arteries to heart valves. These injuries can lead to severe complications requiring urgent interventions [ 3 ]. Managing the risk of bleeding during cardiac surgery starts with correcting anemia before surgery and using iron and erythropoeitin (EPO). Intraoperative management involves controlling blood loss through careful surgical techniques, maintaining body temperature, and using cell savers. After surgery, microvascular bleeding is treated with platelet transfusions and coagulation support [ 4 ]. CPB causes great hemostatic disturbances, such as acidosis, hyperfibrinolysis, dilutional and consumptive coagulopathy, and hypothermia. Careful and effective management through unfractionated heparin is necessary to avoid complications of insufficient reversal through protamine sulfate. Hemostatic monitoring through viscoelastic hemostatic assays (VHAs) is beneficial in this regard [ 5 ]. The immature coagulation systems of neonates increase their vulnerability to post-CPB bleeding, and protamine administration helps reverse the effects of heparin. However, a balance between heparin and protamine is crucial to minimize bleeding risks during and following CPB [ 6 ]. Over time, both pharmacological and nonpharmacological strategies to manage coagulation have significantly evolved. The antifibrinolytics aprotinin, tranexamic acid (TXA), and ε-aminocaproic acid (EACA) efficiently reduce bleeding and transfusion needs by inhibiting fibrinolysis, but there are potential side effects as well; aprotinin was withdrawn from the market owing to renal toxicity and increased mortality, and tranexamic acid and EACA are at risk of postoperative seizures, although EACA is less potent than TXA but has a lower risk of seizures. The choice and dosage of antifibrinolytics should be individually determined for each patient [ 7 ]. If bleeding is related to coagulation factor deficiency, prothrombin complex concentrates (PCCs) or fresh frozen plasma (FFP) should be administered [ 4 ]. For managing refractory bleeding after cardiac surgery, rFVIIa at a dose of 35 μg/kg is recommended, and its administration is better guided via thromboelastography than standard coagulation tests, but it is used off-label. TEG® also offers a comprehensive assessment of coagulation, but rFVIIa therapy does not significantly improve TEG® values in nonhemophilia patients compared with those in patients with hemophilia [ 8 ]. Recent guidelines recommend not using rFVIIa since adverse events outweigh the benefits [ 9 – 12 ].\n\nMethodology\n\nThis review addresses the following question: “What are the effective pharmacological and nonpharmacological strategies for managing coagulation in cardiothoracic surgery?” We searched PubMed for articles up to August 17, 2024, without applying filters, focusing on studies about coagulation management strategies in patients undergoing cardiothoracic procedures. We conducted two screening steps: first, we reviewed titles and abstracts, followed by full-text analysis. All the authors participated in screening and tabulation via Rayyan. We did not conduct a formal quality evaluation due to topic heterogeneity.\n\nInclusion criteria\n\nWe included studies that were published in English and included case studies, case series, cross-sectional research, case‒control studies, cohort studies, systematic reviews and meta-analyses. These studies were selected on the basis of their relevance to the field of cardiothoracic surgery and their contribution to understanding coagulation management strategies. We prioritized research that presented novel or significant insights into the pharmacological and nonpharmacological approaches to coagulation in cardiothoracic surgery.\n\n((“pharmacological” OR “drug therapy” OR “medication” OR “pharmacotherapy” OR “pharmaceuticals”) AND (“non-pharmacological” OR “non-drug” OR “non-medicinal” OR “alternative therapy” OR “interventions” OR “strategies”)) AND (“coagulation” OR “blood clotting” OR “hemostasis” OR “anticoagulation” OR “bleeding control”) AND (“cardiothoracic surgery” OR “cardiac surgery” OR “thoracic surgery” OR “open heart surgery” OR “cardiovascular surgery” OR “CABG” OR “coronary artery bypass grafting” OR “valve replacement surgery”)).\n\nExclusion criteria\n\nWe excluded publications that did not meet the criteria for rigorous scientific contribution, including preprints, non-English publications, gray literature, letters to the editor, and meeting reports. Additionally, narrative reviews were excluded because they did not provide original data or findings. We also excluded cadaver and animal studies, as well as studies that focused on unrelated surgical procedures, as these were not directly relevant to the scope of our review on coagulation management in cardiothoracic surgery.\n\nResults\n\nFrom an initial database of 223 results, we filtered out duplicates, leaving 79 unique articles after title and abstract screening. Following a full-text review in the second screening round, we obtained 38 studies for further analysis, which are presented in Table 1 .\n\nAdditionally, in response to the valuable feedback provided by the reviewers, we incorporated several studies they recommended, ensuring a more comprehensive representation of the available literature on the topic.\n\nPathophysiology of coagulation during cardiothoracic surgery\n\nCompared with thoracic surgery, cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) leads to greater blood clotting and fibrin breakdown during heart surgery. Higher levels of thrombin antithrombin-3 complex (TAT) suggest increased thrombin formation, which contributes to this heightened coagulation during CPB. Additionally, CPB is responsible for fibrinolysis during surgery, as D-dimer and tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) levels increase, which helps explain the postoperative hypercoagulable state [ 13 ]. When blood comes into contact with artificial cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) equipment, factor XII undergoes autocleavage into factor XIIa. This process activates prekallikrein to produce kallikrein, which enhances the cleavage of high-molecular-weight kininogen (HMWK). Moreover, pulmonary clearance of bradykinin is reduced, leading to increased tPA secretion and the promotion of fibrinolysis. Factor XIIa also converts factor XI to factor XIa and plasminogen to plasmin. Plasmin triggers fibrin degradation, causing an imbalance between fibrin formation and degradation, resulting in a hyperfibrinolytic state. Additionally, during CPB, systemic inflammatory response syndrome occurs due to leukocyte activation, which further activates procoagulants. This is accompanied by a decrease in protein C levels, contributing to a prothrombotic state. Finally, the fibrinogen-bound CPB circuit activates platelets through GPIIb/IIIa receptors, facilitating thrombin formation [ 14 ]. Hypothermia, venous cannulation, and surgical trauma during CPB can inhibit clotting factors and platelets, leading to bleeding and systemic inflammation [ 15 ]. Cardiopulmonary bypass can harm microcirculation, causing microbubble formation that activates complement, aggregates platelets, and leads to clotting [ 16 ]. After cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB), several hemostatic and viscoelastic parameters are significantly affected. The international normalized ratio (INR) and prothrombin time (PT) each increased by 33%, whereas activated partial thromboplastin time (PTT) also increased by 33%. Fibrinogen levels decreased by 36%, and platelet counts decreased by 45%, with platelet function decreasing by 50% to 70%. Clotting time and fibrinolysis are prolonged, collectively increasing the risk of bleeding and increasing morbidity and mortality rates [ 17 ]. Patients with preoperative disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) who undergo cardiac surgery have longer ICU stays than those without DIC. Hypofibrinogenemia during complex procedures can lead to various complications [ 18 ]. Coagulopathy during CPB also arises for various reasons, including hemodilution due to priming fluids, blood loss, and the use of heparin for systemic anticoagulation during CPB [ 19 ].\n\nCurrent pharmacological approaches in coagulation management\n\nDuring cardiac surgery, the patient’s blood is oxygenated through CPB, in which contact with foreign nonendothelial nonendothelial extracorporeal circulation (ECC) surfaces activates intrinsic and extrinsic coagulation pathways that merge in the common final pathway for the generation of thrombin and platelet activation. Perioperative management of ischemic heart disease patients includes aspirin. Postoperative management includes vitamin K antagonists after mechanical heart valve or left ventricular assist device (LVAD) implantation. Antiplatelet therapy after CABG or LVAD includes aspirin, warfarin, or P2Y12-receptor antagonists [ 20 ]. Unfractionated heparin is mainly used as an anticoagulant for CBP during cardiac surgery because of its cost-effectiveness and easy administration. Heparin inhibits Factor Xa via AT via tissue factor inhibitors, breaks down fibrin, and binds to positively charged plasma proteins such as platelet factor 4 (PF4), von Willebrand factor (vWF), platelets, and macrophages. Heparin binds to ECC, reducing its bioavailability. The decreased responsiveness to heparin, called heparin resistance, is due to AT deficiency and is managed by adding additional heparin. The administration of fresh frozen plasma provides additional AT [ 21 ]. The standard protamine-to-heparin ratio is 1 mg of protamine per 100 units of heparin. This ratio may vary depending on factors such as the heparin dose and renal function. Proper titration is crucial to avoid bleeding or thrombosis [ 22 ]. Compared with FFP, antithrombin is more effective and safer for treating heparin resistance [ 23 ]. Recombinant human antithrombin III (rhATIII) is used to restore heparin responsiveness in patients with antithrombin deficiency, particularly during CPB. It works by increasing ATIII activity, thus improving thrombin inhibition. This treatment reduces the need for fresh frozen plasma in heparin-resistant patients [ 24 ]. Antifibrinolytics, including aprotinin and tranexamic acid, are important in cardiac surgery to decrease perioperative bleeding. Tranexamic acid binds plasminogen at the lysine binding site, thus preventing plasmin formation, which inhibits fibrinolysis [ 25 ]. Aprotinin, a hemostatic drug used in heart surgery with CPB, targets plasma kallikrein, plasmin, thrombin, and protease-activated receptor 1 (PAR-1) on platelets and tissue factors by binding to their active sites. The intrinsic pathway is inhibited by kallikrein. The extrinsic pathway is inhibited by the inhibition of tissue factors by aprotinin, which also inhibits thrombin in the common pathway, thus improving hemostasis and atrial fibrillation [ 26 ]. Andexanet alfa is used for rivaroxaban and apixaban, whereas idarucizumab reverses dabigatran. These antidotes are crucial in the perioperative period for patients on DOAC therapy to prevent excessive bleeding [ 27 ]. The increased risk of pump thrombus in patients with LVAD, who present with increased pump power, hemolysis or cardiac failure, can be managed by glycoprotein IIb/IIIa platelet inhibitors such as eptifibatide or tirofiban and vitamin K antagonists. However, eptifibatide increases bleeding risk, so the dose is either reduced or discontinued [ 28 ]. CABG is associated with atherosclerotic plaque risk one year after surgery. A high success rate is achieved by preventing graft occlusion. Aspirin alone or aspirin with other P2Y12 receptor antagonists reduces the risk of ischemia and maintains graft patency. Compared with clopidogrel, ticagrelor is associated with a lower risk of thrombosis without major bleeding problems. It has a faster onset and inhibits P2Y12 receptors [ 29 ]. Protamine overdose should be avoided since it results in factor V inhibition and platelet dysfunction [ 30 – 32 ].\n\nNonpharmacological techniques for coagulation management\n\nSurgical hemostatic methods, such as fibrin-based agents such as glues, sponges, and mechanical devices, are ineffective alone or as replacements for traditional hemostatic methods. However, their use with methods such as suture, cautery, or compressions has improved outcomes in various surgeries, including cardiac procedures [ 33 ]. The additional use of thrombin and fibrin sealants during cardiac surgery results in rapid hemostasis and reduced blood loss. However, these methods are ineffective at reducing complications, mortality, and transfusions and are uneconomical [ 34 ]. Fibrin-based sealants are beneficial in cardiac surgery, particularly when surgery is infeasible; when the structure is surgically inaccessible; and in aortic, valvular, or septal repair. Some FDA-approved sealants for these purposes include TachoSil®, COSEAL®, and BIOGLUE®; however, these agents cannot replace sutures for hemostasis in major vascular hemorrhage [ 35 ]. The use of bovine thrombin as a topical hemostat caused an immunologic reaction in a patient during cardiac surgery, causing coagulopathy [ 36 ]. FLOSEAL®, an active flowable hemostat, showed greater efficacy than passive, nonflowable agents as well as other active flowable agents during cardiothoracic surgery and resulted in fewer complications and transfusion needs [ 37 ]. During CABG, suturing with the application of autologous FG-PRP gel to the anastomotic area reduces bleeding without causing any immunologic complications [ 38 ]. ROTEM® analysis of cardiac surgery involving the use of HCA (hypothermic cardiac arrest) revealed increased bleeding time and decreased clot strength [ 39 ]. The cell salvage technique involves gathering and delivering the patient’s RBCs and reducing the need for allogeneic transfusion. Its use in cardiac surgery does not affect the volume of RBCs transfused and increases the mean PaO₂/FiO₂; however, it decreases the platelet and clotting factor levels, prolonging the international normalized ratio (INR), so it should be used cautiously in patients at high risk of bleeding [ 40 ]. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), or precisely extracorporeal life support (ECLS), is used to support patients with cardiopulmonary failure, but it poses a serious coagulopathy risk. The artificial surface damages RBCs and activates platelets and coagulation pathways, causing thrombosis in the circuit and hemorrhage in patients; thus, antithrombotic therapy becomes necessary [ 41 ]. CytoSorb® is a blood purification device that reduces the levels of inflammatory mediators and cytokines, improving coagulation outcomes. Studies have shown that it reduces blood transfusions in patients undergoing hypothermic cardiac arrest (HCA) and those receiving antithrombotic therapy. It has been recommended in recent guidelines to support coagulation management in cardiac surgery [ 42 ]. Heparin is the main choice for ECMO because of its short half-life and ability to eliminate protamine, but heparin resistance or heparin-induced thrombocytopenia can occur. Fondaparinux does not cause HIT but is not easily reversible. LMWH is used prophylactically. Intravenously administered direct thrombin inhibitors are a good choice in ECMO; however, argatroban needs dose adjustment in patients with liver failure, whereas bivalirudin and fondaparinux need dose adjustment in patients with renal insufficiency [ 43 ].\n\nLEGEND: (+ means activation,—means inhibition) (FG-PRP gel® = fibrin glue platelet-rich plasma gel; TACHOSIL® = collagen sponge coated with human fibrinogen and thrombin; COSEAL® = polyethylene glycol-based hydrogel sealant; BIOGLUE® = bovine serum albumin and glutaraldehyde-based surgical adhesive).\n\nInterplay between pharmacological and nonpharmacological approaches\n\nSystemic inflammatory response, hemodilution, hypothermia, neuroendocrine abnormalities, ischemia‒reperfusion injury, trauma-induced inflammation, hypoxia, MI, acidosis, vasoplegic syndrome, MI and low cardiac output are the various pathophysiological conditions observed in postcardiac surgery patients. ACE inhibitors or ARBs, CCBs, beta-blockers, IV insulin, and cardiac rehabilitation are advised to prevent postoperative adverse effects. Cardiac rehabilitation is included in the care of patients with cardiac problems [ 44 ]. Protamine is used to reverse the anticoagulant effect of heparin after CPB. Acidosis, hemodilution, hypocalcemia, and hypothermia disrupt hemostasis by impairing clot formation [ 31 ]. RCTs have demonstrated that combining both pharmacological and nonpharmacological techniques may eliminate the need for blood coagulation products and allogeneic red blood cell transfusions due to their synergistic effects. Intraoperative cell salvage is an effective technique for perioperative RBC conservation. Patients in the intraoperative cell salvage group required fewer blood transfusions than did those in the control group. Combining acute perioperative normovolemic hemodilution and intraoperative cell salvage offered no additional benefit over cell salvage alone [ 45 ]. The effectiveness of the antiplatelet agent triflusal was compared with that of the oral anticoagulant acenocoumarol in patients who had undergone aortic or mitral valve replacement. The results revealed significantly fewer bleeding incidents with triflusal than with acenocoumarol. No single case of thrombus was detected in any of the survivors, suggesting sufficient antithrombotic protection [ 46 ]. The effectiveness of the antiplatelet agent triflusal was compared with that of the oral anticoagulant acenocoumarol in patients who had undergone aortic or mitral valve replacement. The results revealed significantly fewer bleeding incidents with triflusal than with acenocoumarol. No single case of thrombus was detected in any of the survivors, suggesting sufficient antithrombotic protection [ 47 ].\n\nPatient-specific coagulation strategies in cardiothoracic surgery\n\nPatient-specific coagulation strategies are based on patient risk factors (age, blood transfusions, more than 24 h of mechanical ventilation, or postoperative complications), which suggest the use of IPC in conjunction with pharmacological prophylaxis as soon as sufficient hemostasis has been achieved [ 48 ]. Postoperative atrial fibrillation (POAF) is more common in patients undergoing cardiac or thoracic surgical procedures. Warfarin manages POAF in valve surgery patients. Novel oral anticoagulants (NOACs) manage patients with nonvalvular POAF (e.g., after lung resection or coronary bypass surgery) because of their ability to rapidly establish anticoagulation levels [ 49 ]. TXA has been used in all hemophilia patients requiring major surgeries because of its beneficial antifibrinolytic effects. Excessive amounts of colloid plasma expanders can significantly compromise fibrinogen polymerization and whole blood clot formation; hence, substitution with a fibrinogen concentrate may be needed [ 50 ]. Four main strategies are used to manage heparin resistance during CPB. To obtain the required ACT, more heparin is administered first, followed by FFP to deliver more AT, and then AT is supplemented with AT concentrate. Subtherapeutic ACT should be adopted, and CPB should be started without further therapy as the last alternative [ 21 ]. Algorithm-based hemostatic therapy is superior to clinical judgment-based empiric hemostatic therapy. The implementation of POC methods in hemotherapy algorithms reduces the transfusion rate of allogeneic blood products and improves patients’ clinical outcomes concerning preoperative anticoagulant therapy. Tailored goal-directed hemostatic therapy, or the “theranostic” approach, is the most effective and secure method to stop bleeding. The application of POC algorithms, which are based on first-line therapy with fibrinogen and PCC and are guided by TEG® and whole-blood impedance aggregometry, improves patient outcomes, reduces allogeneic blood transfusions, lowers thrombotic/thromboembolic and transfusion-related events, and decreases hospital expenses [ 51 – 57 ].\n\nImpact of coagulation management on postoperative outcomes\n\nHeavy bleeding after cardiac surgery leads to increased morbidity and mortality, which is related to critical injuries to the organ system due to transfusion and hyperperfusion. Preexisting inherited (deficiency in coagulation pathways or platelets) or preoperatively acquired (DIC or hepatic or renal failure) potential defects affect the hemostatic system and can influence bleeding postcardiac surgery. Activated extrinsic and intrinsic pathways can lead to increased fibrinolytic activity and thrombin generation. Hyperresponders to pharmacological agents (NSAIDs and aspirin) can cause heavy bleeding. Fresh frozen plasma (FPP), cryoprecipitate, or factor concentrates are used in the replenishment of coagulation factors to prevent excessive bleeding [ 58 ]. Coagulopathy due to massive transfusion and uncontrolled bleeding results in defects in clot firmness and decreased clot stability [ 59 ]. For the treatment of coagulation factor-mediated bleeding in cardiac surgery, the use of prothrombin complex concentrators (PCCs) has increased steadily. The number of postoperative transfusions of RBCs has decreased with the use of PCC [ 60 ]. Acute kidney injury after cardiac surgery can result from microembolization, neurohormonal activation, oxidative stress, exogenous and endogenous toxins, inflammatory factors, and ischemia‒reperfusion injury. A postoperative strategy to prevent AKI after cardiac surgery is to maintain a hemoglobin level > 8 g/dl [ 61 ]. Preprocedure management for coagulopathies includes short-term discontinuation of antiplatelet or anticoagulant medications. For high-risk surgeries such as cardiothoracic surgery, direct oral anticoagulants are used. Intraprocedure management includes heparin management and protamine reversal, tranexamic acid usage, and standard laboratory testing. Point-of-care (POC) testing is becoming important in the management of coagulopathies [ 17 ]. To reduce the incidence of postoperative complications and long-term mortality in cardiac surgery, avoiding blood transfusion may prove beneficial. Postoperative cell salvage has decreased the length of hospital stay, risk of infection, and mortality rate [ 62 ]. Postoperative interventions to manage coagulopathies include thromboelastography (TEG®) and recombinant factor VII A administration [ 63 ]. Aprotinin has proven to be safe in decreasing postoperative blood drainage and transfusion requirements during CABG. Nonpharmacological blood-saving strategies such as intraoperative hemodilution, autologous blood transfusions, and ECC blood retransfusions have been increasingly used in recent years [ 47 ].\n\nRole of coagulation monitoring during cardiothoracic surgery\n\nPoint-of-care (POC) monitoring of hemostatic dysfunction is important because acute postoperative bleeding is a life-threatening condition. Bleeding after cardiac surgery is associated with platelet dysfunction, residual circulating heparin, low levels of coagulation factors, and the administration of preoperative oral anticoagulants. POC devices are effective in determining the efficacy of hemostatic treatment. In a POC-based study, postoperative bleeding decreased from ~ 600 to 400 ml within the first 12 h [ 64 ]. The TEG® 6 s system based on the resonance viscoelastic technique appeared to be appropriate for POC hemostasis assessment in cardiac surgery [ 65 ]. In cases of severe perioperative bleeding during cardiac surgery, POC coagulation monitoring assists in the administration of factor concentrates. In a POC-based study, postoperative bleeding decreased from ~ 600 to 400 ml in the first 12 h [ 63 ]. ROTEM® is used to measure hemostasis quality via the viscoelastic properties of blood clots. ROTEM® provides a quick assessment of clot development from secondary hemostasis to lysis of the clot, including formation, firmness, and fibrinolysis of the clot. ROTEM® also provides information about PT (prothrombin time), PTT (partial thromboplastin time), and the international normalized ratio (INR). Different ROTEM® assays are available: INTEM® measures the activation of the intrinsic pathway via ellagic acid and is heparin sensitive, the HEPTEM® assay is used in the presence of heparin, EXTEM® assesses the extrinsic pathway, the APTEM® assay uses antifibrinolytics to inhibit hyperfibrinolysis, and the FIBTEM® assay uses cytochalasin to inhibit platelets in clot formation [ 66 ]. Activated clotting time (ACT) is commonly used to manage anticoagulation and control the heparin dosage. For measuring ACT, a Hemochron® Response device and Hemochron® Signature Elite devices were used. Decreased ACT values can lead to increased heparin dosages during CPB, which leads to excessive bleeding after cardiac surgery. Research has shown that the Hemochron® Signature Elite device is more reliable but has greater variability in the presence of heparin than the Hemochron® Response device when the ACT is measured [ 67 ].\n\nPharmacogenomics and its influence on anticoagulation therapy\n\nThe pharmacogenomics of a drug explains the effects of genetic variations on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of that particular drug. For example, the metabolism of various anticoagulants, such as warfarin, is different in different individuals because of genetic polymorphisms in a single nucleotide of the gene encoding the enzymes P450 2C9 and vitamin K epoxide reductase [ 68 ]. Two single nucleotide polymorphisms have been detected in the gene encoding the enzyme CYP2C9, namely, CYP2C9*2 and CYP2C9*3, and one single-nucleotide polymorphism has been detected in the gene encoding vitamin K epoxide reductase complex 1 (VKORC1). These three single nucleotide polymorphisms are responsible for selecting a particular warfarin dose for anticoagulant effects in any patient [ 69 ]. For many years, warfarin has been the most commonly prescribed oral anticoagulant during cardiac surgery. However, the selection of the dose of warfarin has been the most challenging part of treatment due to the narrow therapeutic index of warfarin and its subjective variability [ 70 ]. Multiple factors responsible for this genetic variability in different regions include age, sex, weight, obesity, hepatic or renal disease, and plasma levels of different proteins [ 71 ]. Drug interactions with anticoagulants vary from person to person. For example, oral warfarin can interact with other drugs if taken orally, and even variability in the percentage of dietary vitamin K can affect the dose of warfarin used for anticoagulant effects in different patients undergoing cardiothoracic surgery [ 72 ]. Genetic testing can be helpful for the selection of an anticoagulant drug during cardiac surgery. Although pharmacogenetic testing is not recommended in every case, the FDA has labeled CYP2C9 and VKORC1 genotype testing for warfarin dose selection whenever available. This is to avoid any adverse outcomes due to genetic variability among different individuals [ 73 ]. Clopidogrel is a prodrug that requires metabolism by hepatic cytochrome P450 enzymes. Genetic polymorphisms in CYP2C19 (e.g., CYP2C19*2, 3) lead to reduced or absent metabolism of clopidogrel. Drugs such as prasugrel and ticagrelor, which do not require CYP2C19 for activation, should be considered for poor metabolizers [ 74 ].\n\nChallenges and complications in coagulation management\n\nHeart diseases are the number one cause of death worldwide. In cases of heart valve defects, coronary blockage, congenital birth anomalies, etc., surgeons use either catheter-based techniques or surgical approaches [ 20 ]. Although the management of bleeding and coagulation is challenging during and after surgery, monitoring coagulation via multiple approaches can help surgeons administer necessary coagulation or anticoagulation therapy. Nevertheless, factors such as the preoperative use of protamine sulfate, hemodilution, and platelet levels can lead to coagulation abnormalities during and after cardiac surgery [ 75 ]. The postoperative use of various anticoagulation therapies, such as aspirin, can reduce the risk of postoperative complications, such as ischemic heart problems and mortality [ 29 ]. Various surgeries have reported excessive anticoagulation as a lifelong threat to patients. For example, mechanical aortic valve replacement is associated with greater bleeding risk throughout life due to excessive use of anticoagulants. Therefore, to manage bleeding in such cases, prosthetic aortic valve replacement is a better choice because of the lower likelihood of lifelong anticoagulation [ 76 ]. However, in some cases, reduced anticoagulation is challenging. For example, during cardiac surgery, factors such as low BP, decreased cardiac output, intravenous catheterization, and inappropriate use of procoagulant drugs can trigger platelet aggregation and thrombus formation, which ultimately lead to the postsurgery thromboembolic stage [ 77 ]. TXA and procoagulant drugs such as thrombin can also be considered for cardiothoracic surgery patients, depending upon their condition [ 78 , 79 ]. However, unfractionated heparin is still the drug of choice during cardiac surgery to achieve an anticoagulant effect [ 21 ].\n\nEmerging trends in coagulation management: innovations in cardiothoracic surgery\n\nThe latest advances in managing coagulation in cardiothoracic surgery include the use of prothrombin complex concentrates (PCCs) and fibrinogen concentrates to reduce bleeding and the need for transfusions [ 80 ]. Recent studies have indicated the use of heparin, warfarin, and aspirin in the short-term and long-term management of patients with congenital heart diseases undergoing valve, shunt, and conduit procedures. After some surgeries, such as the Fontan surgery, DOACs (direct oral anticoagulants), such as rivaroxaban, have demonstrated significant effectiveness. Techniques such as VerifyNow-Aspirin TM and TEG-PM TM are used to monitor aspirin resistance and improve patient outcomes [ 81 ]. Biomaterials such as chitosan and collagen infused with gelatin microspheres have been shown to improve hemostasis and help in tissue repair. Chitosan exhibits excellent biocompatibility, whereas collagen infused with gelatin microspheres shows enhanced structural integration, both of which are useful for managing coagulopathy [ 82 ]. Furthermore, HEMOBLAST TM is a new hemostatic agent that combines collagen, chondroitin sulfate, and thrombin. This agent is easy to apply and aims to enhance coagulation management in cardiothoracic surgeries [ 83 ]. Although the patient blood management (PBM) program has improved transfusion practices and patient outcomes in cardiothoracic surgery, the authors suggest increasing provider education on transfusion practices and integrating clinical decision support systems with continuous auditing mechanisms. This will ensure adherence to established guidelines for improved patient safety [ 84 ]. Future strategies to improve coagulation management in pediatric cardiac surgery patients should focus on the use of fresh whole blood for CPB priming. Additionally, goal-directed transfusion algorithms should be used, and point-of-care testing should be implemented. These strategies enhance transfusion practices and reduce complications related to blood product use, ensuring timely and effective patient care during surgical procedures [ 85 ].\n\nMultidisciplinary team approach to coagulation management\n\nMultidisciplinary handling is crucial for coagulation management in cardiothoracic surgery. Cardiac anesthesiologists, surgeons, and perfusionists collaborate and discuss preoperative patients’ coagulation status to devise targeted strategies. Intraoperatively, hematologists manage coagulopathies; cardiothoracic surgeons perform meticulous hemostasis; and anesthesiologists maintain optimal conditions for coagulation [ 1 ]. Anesthesiologists use point-of-care coagulation testing tools such as TEG®, ROTEM®, and Sonoclot® to monitor the real-time coagulation state of patients, which can guide anticoagulation therapy during cardiac procedures [ 86 ]. Moreover, effective communication and coordination are vital for enhancing human‒machine teamwork in the operating room to ensure optimal patient outcomes. Integrating computer vision technology helps to monitor critical parameters such as bleeding volume through surgical videos, ultimately enhancing team dynamics [ 87 ]. Dialog between healthcare providers and patients encourages better understanding and adherence to treatment plans. Misunderstandings and negative consequences for patients can occur. Therefore, healthcare professionals should be trained in communication skills to ensure proper patient care and a collaborative healthcare environment. [ 88 ]. Recent studies have shown that simulation-based education involving crisis resource management (CRM), in which complete cardiac teams participate in realistic simulations, can train cardiac surgical teams for crisis management, including coagulopathy management after cardiopulmonary bypass. This training aims to promote effective teamwork, ultimately reducing errors and improving patient safety through improved communication and rapid decision-making. Regular team debriefing further enhances team performance [ 89 ]. Figs. 1 and 2\n\nCost-effectiveness of combined coagulation management strategies\n\nEffective coagulation management during cardiothoracic surgery not only reduces complications but also impacts medical expenses. The use of anticoagulants, heparin, warfarin, and direct anticoagulants is effective but comes with high costs because it requires monitoring and management of side effects such as bleeding [ 90 ]. On the other hand, nonpharmacological strategies, which include mechanical hemostasis techniques such as sutures, clamps, and intraoperative cell salvage systems, require high initial investments, but in the long term, they reduce drug dependency and complications [ 91 ]. The blood transfusions required during cardiothoracic surgery are costly and carry risks such as infection and immune reactions. Studies have shown that a combined approach using antifibrinolytics (e.g., tranexamic acid) and nonpharmacological interventions such as cell salvage decreases the need for transfusions by up to 30% [ 92 ]. Additionally, fewer transfusions, in turn, lead to shorter postoperative ICU stays, which again lowers healthcare costs [ 93 ]. A recent study suggested that implementing patient blood management (PBM) in cardiothoracic surgery can help minimize unnecessary blood transfusions, leading to better patient outcomes and significant cost savings for the healthcare system [ 94 ]. Limiting the storage time of RBCs to 2 weeks or less can enhance not only clinical outcomes but also the cost efficiency of cardiothoracic surgical procedures [ 95 ]. Figs. 3 , 4 , and 5\n\nConclusion\n\nUsing intraoperative blood salvage techniques, mechanical methods and prophylactic administration of antifibrinolytics agents, preoperative management of anemia and drug-induced or inherited bleeding disorders, and hemodilution are recommended to reduce blood loss during surgery [ 9 , 11 , 96 ]. Postoperative fluid management should be performed to stop postoperative bleeding [ 10 ]. Despite the overall progress, gaps are still present in understanding the combined use of pharmacological and nonpharmacological strategies in the general population [ 97 ]. The effects of the use of individual drugs have been studied to a great extent, but the same has yet to be done for combined drug use, especially in high-risk groups such as those with preexisting coagulopathies. Thus, further research is needed to assess the long-term outcomes of these combined approaches. Future clinical trials should focus on assessing the long-term efficacy and cost effectiveness of integrated coagulation management. Large-scale, multicenter studies would be highly useful in providing more comprehensive data on patient outcomes and financial impacts [ 98 ]. In addition, trials should be performed to explore the effects of these strategies in specific high-risk populations, such as elderly individuals, patients with complex medical histories, and patients with coagulopathies. The current guidelines may need to evolve to include more detailed recommendations on the combined use of cell salvage technologies, mechanical hemostasis, and antifibrinolytics for various patient profiles. Updating these guidelines could enhance the quality of patient care and improve cost efficiency in healthcare systems worldwide [ 99 , 100 ].\n\nThe limitation\n\nA limitation of this narrative review is that various study designs with differing levels of evidence, such as high-quality randomized controlled trials (RCTs), cohort studies, and smaller observational studies or case reports, are reviewed together. This may introduce variability and result in a somewhat fragmented interpretation of the findings. The diverse methodologies of the included studies reflect the available body of literature, but this heterogeneity may impact the overall consistency of the conclusions.",
