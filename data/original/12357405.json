  "title": "Total intravenous-opioid-free anesthesia/analgesia (OFAA) for a morbid obese patient with a body mass index of 99 kg/m 2 undergoing gastric bypass: a case report",
  "abstract": "Background: Bariatric surgery has been established as an effective intervention for weight reduction and the improvement of comorbidities. In this context, the use of opioid-free anesthesia with multimodal analgesia is gaining importance because of its ability to minimize respiratory complications and other opioid-related adverse effects in these patients. In the reviewed literature we found no reports of the use of opioid-free anesthesia/analgesia with total intravenous anesthesia based on propofol/lidocaine/ketamine/dexmedetomidine in bariatric surgery for patients with morbid obesity with a body mass index greater than 60 kg/m 2 .\n\nCase presentation: The anesthetic management of a 50-year-old white-Hispanic female patient was documented. The patient suffered from morbid obesity with weight 260 kg, height 1.62 m, and a body mass index of 99 kg/m 2 . She was American Society of Anesthesiologists III with obesity hypoventilation syndrome, and chronic heart failure.The patient was scheduled for laparoscopic gastric bypass. Opioid-free anesthesia/analgesia was performed via total intravenous anesthesia based on propofol and standard multimodal analgesia. Low-dose infusions of lidocaine, ketamine, and dexmedetomidine were continued for 48 hours. The patient had a good level of satisfaction during the postoperative period, without the need for postoperative rescue opioids. There was effective pain control (VAS < 3) and an absence of postoperative nausea and vomiting. No respiratory, cardiovascular, or gastric complications were observed during the hospital stay, and she was discharged on the eleventh postoperative day, indicating a high level of satisfaction without complications or adverse effects.\n\nConclusions: This case shows that opioid-free anesthesia/analgesia can be feasible and safe. The mandatory use of anesthetic depth monitoring together with the validation of target-control infusion models for propofol in obese patients are both recommended to facilitate the more frequent use of total intravenous anesthesia-target-control infusion in this population.",

  "full_text": "Introduction\n\nCurrent evidence indicates that morbidly obese patients with a body mass index (BMI) greater than 40 are more susceptible to the sedative effects of opioids and to side effects such as respiratory depression and delayed awakening. Furthermore, the gastrointestinal side effects of opioids, such as nausea and vomiting, intestinal ileus, residual gastric dilatation, and abdominal distention, can represent significant problems and jeopardize postsurgical outcomes. In laparoscopic bariatric surgery, opioid-free anesthesia/analgesia (OFAA) can be a technique with a positive impact on perioperative outcomes. Compared with opioid-based anesthesia, OFAAs have shown favorable analgesic results in noninferiority studies. It also allows the reduction, or even avoidance, of the adverse effects associated with the use of these drugs [ 1 – 3 ].\n\nTherefore, the opioid-free technique could be an alternative to opioid-based anesthesia, especially in cases of extreme obesity. We present a clinical case of a female patient with a BMI of 99 kg/m 2 who underwent gastric bypass and was managed with opioid-free anesthesia/analgesia (OFAA). This bariatric surgery scenario has not been documented in the current literature with OFAA-TIVA management. Moreover, few studies have investigated the use of anesthesia with propofol/lidocaine/ketamine/dexmedetomidine-based (OFAA-TIVA) in superobese patients undergoing bariatric surgery. A reduction in gastrointestinal complications, such as postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV), ileus, and residual gastric dilation, without the detriment of postoperative analgesia are beneficial and may contribute to a reduced hospital stay and a more favorable perioperative outcome [ 4 – 7 ].\n\nCase presentation\n\nA 45-year-old female patient with an ASA III classification for morbid obesity, a weight of 260 kg and a height of 162 cm, a BMI of 99 kg/m 2 , hypoventilation syndrome due to obesity (Pickwick syndrome) and chronic heart failure (Figs. 1 , 2 ) who was scheduled to undergo laparoscopic gastric bypass was included. She mentioned that she was only being treated with low-molecular-weight heparin at thromboprophylaxis doses and vitamins.\n\nThe anesthetic technique chosen was opioid-free total intravenous anesthesia (OFAA-TIVA), implemented by total intravenous anesthesia manually with 10% propofol, 1% lidocaine, ketamine (1 mg/ml), and dexmedetomidine (2 mcg/ml), which was calculated according to adjusted weight. Rocuronium doses were calculated using the ideal weight. Details on the weight used in each anesthetic medication are described in Table 1 .\n\nAn ultrasound-localized peripheral venous line was accessed. Standard monitoring was used: electrocardiogram, heart rate, pulse oximetry, noninvasive blood pressure measurement with an extralarge cuff, bispectral index (BIS), and temperature. Continuous monitoring of neuromuscular blockade with a TOFF-Cuff™ monitor was used. The neuromuscular relaxation level was managed with successive boluses every 35–40 minutes according to the train of four (TOF). Mechanical ventilation was set with a tidal volume (TV) of 8 ml/kg-adjusted weight, respiratory rate (RR) of 15–18 rpm to achieve EtCO 2 ranging from 32–36 mmHg, PEEP of 8 cmH2O, and FiO 2 of 0.6. The clinical course during anesthesia and surgery is shown in Fig. 3 .\n\nFor multimodal analgesia, paracetamol (1 g), dexamethasone (8 mg), metamizole (2 g), dexketoprofen (50 mg), and magnesium sulfate infusion (bolus 40 mg/kg followed by infusion of 7 mg/kg-ideal weight/hour) were administered. Pantoprazole (40 mg) was also administered. At the end of the surgery, sugammadex at 4 mg/kg real weight was used to reverse the neuromuscular blockade, which was confirmed with a series of four tests (TOF: T4/T1 = 1). The extubating criteria were as follows: patient alert and obeying to command; TOF: T4/T1 = 1, SpO 2 > 95%, FiO 2 < 0.4, PEEP < 8 mmHg, minute ventilation < 16 L/m, tidal volume (TV) > 4 ml, RR < 25 bpm, rapid shallow breathing index (RSBI) = RR/TV < 105 breaths/min/L, inspiratory pressure > 20 mmHg, Pa/FiO 2 > 200, and VD/VT ≤ 0.6. The patient was extubated in a semisitting position in the operating room and admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for postoperative follow-up.\n\nDuring the postoperative period, multimodal analgesia was continued with dexketoprofen, metamizole, paracetamol, and our medical institution OFAA protocol, which consists of a continuous infusion of lidocaine at 0.5 mg/kg/hour, ketamine at a dose of 0.05 mg/kg/hour, and dexmedetomidine at 0.03 mcg/kg/hour, maintaining this regimen for 48 hours (Table 1 ).\n\nDuring follow-up, SpO2 was between 95 and 96% with a nasal cannula at 2 L/min, and the visual analog scale (VAS) score was less than 3/10 points. She did not need rescue with opioids. She also did not experience PONV, ileus, or gastric dilation. During the first 12 hours in the ICU, the patient showed adequate tolerance to the oral route. She remained there for 48 hours for clinical monitoring. On the third day, the patient was transferred to the ward, and during the postoperative period, no cardiac, respiratory, or infectious complications were documented. The average VAS pain score was between 2 and 3/10 points. Finally, the patient was discharged after 11 days of hospitalization.\n\nDiscussion\n\nObesity has become an endemic disease in Western society. According to the latest WHO report in 2022, one in eight people suffer from this comorbidity [ 1 – 3 ]. Bariatric surgery offers significant benefits for the treatment of morbid obesity in terms of sustained weight loss and improved comorbidities. Thus, bariatric surgery can lead to increased quality of life and increased life expectancy. This has generated a growing global demand for this procedure [ 2 – 5 ]. Notably, this is a complex metabolic disease characterized by a chronic systemic inflammatory state. This condition affects those susceptible patients to intense perioperative nociceptive processes [ 6 ].\n\nFrom the anesthesiologist’s perspective, current Enhanced Recovery After Surgery Society (ERAS) guidelines focus on paying special attention to optimal pain control and prevention of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV). events that are common in bariatric surgery. This risk of PONV is increased in female patients, nonsmokers, those undergoing laparoscopic procedures lasting more than 1 hour, and those receiving inhalational anesthesia with perioperative opioid use [ 4 – 8 ].\n\nIn turn, recent studies have demonstrated the proinflammatory and proglutaminergic effects of opioids at the level of microglia, astrocytes and neurons. Opioids activate NMDA receptors, Toll-Like 4 receptors (TLR4), and purinergic receptors (P2X4Rs, P2X7Rs), thus increasing the levels of sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) and peroxynitrite (ONOO−). As a consequence, opioids increase the levels of TNFα, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-18, complete factor C5a, fractalkine (CX3CL1) and tissue plasminogen-activator [ 9 , 10 ].\n\nTaking into consideration the above aspects, the potential benefit of OFA lies in the fact that the adjuvant analgesics used with this technique have known systemic anti-inflammatory effects, antiglutaminergic actions, and antihyperalgesic effects and provide adequate attenuation of the sympathetic and neuroendocrine responses to surgical stress [ 11 ].\n\nTherefore, in this clinical case, OFA was selected because of its ability to reduce the adverse effects of opioids in patients with extreme obesity, particularly its potential benefits for gastrointestinal function, nociception, and systemic inflammation. As a result, opioid-free anesthesia is a valuable alternative for the anesthetic management of patients with extreme obesity who are undergoing bariatric surgery [ 12 , 13 ].\n\nObesity is also known to significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of intravenous anesthetic drugs, particularly lipid-soluble drugs. These alterations have been considered in our OFA anesthetic plan. For this reason, the manual TIVA of propofol, lidocaine, ketamine and dexmedetomidine was calculated via the ideal weight formula for induction boluses, and the weights were adjusted for maintenance infusions, as indicated in Table 1 . An adjusted weight with a correction factor between 0.35 and 0.40 (35–40% of excess weight) has been proposed to adjust maintenance doses of propofol and other lipid-soluble drugs with good results [ 14 , 15 ].\n\nThere are pharmacokinetic models for TIVA-TCI for propofol, ketamine and dexmedetomidine; however, in our center, we do not have any pharmacokinetic model that has been approved for use in morbidly obese patients. Our infusion pumps consist of either the TCI-Schnider or Marsh models for propofol; however, observations of their use in obese patients have revealed poor predictive ability and a tendency toward overdose [ 16 ]. Cortínez et al. reported an absolute error of 42% for the Schnider model and 41% for the Marsh model, with positive biases (underprediction) in Schnider and negative biases (overprediction) in Marsh for the obese population. Thus, changes in propofol clearance in obese adults are best predicted via allometry and weight, rather than lean mass or ideal weight, as a size descriptor [ 16 , 17 ].\n\nAlthough the TCI-Cortínez and TCI-Eleveld models for propofol are not widely available, they are currently considered the most appropriate for use in the obese population, as they use allometric pharmacokinetic calculations and have better predictive performance [ 15 , 18 , 19 ]. We consider that, in the management of patients with extreme obesity, knowledge of the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic changes in these patients and the use of appropriate monitoring of anesthetic depth, nociceptive monitoring and neuromuscular relaxation (NMR) monitoring are key to the successful performance of TIVA-OFA anesthesia with propofol [ 4 , 15 , 16 ].\n\nAvoiding the use of volatile anesthetics, promoting the use of total intravenous anesthesia with propofol (TIVA), the use of anesthetic adjuvants with systemic anti-inflammatory and antihyperalgesic effects (ketamine/lidocaine/ketamine/dexmedetomidine), the use of multimodal analgesia, and minimizing the use of intra- and postoperative opioids are recommended strategies to reduce the side effects of opioids, particularly nausea and vomiting. In bariatric surgery centers, this approach has gained importance because up to 42.7% of patients require rescue antiemetic medication, despite dual prophylaxis with dexamethasone and ondansetron [ 20 – 24 ].\n\nA multimodal approach including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory analgesics, local anesthetics, and opioid-free anesthesia (OFA) may provide acceptable pain control, decrease perioperative inflammation, and reduce PONV with better perioperative outcomes than the opioid-based approach does [ 25 – 28 ]. In view of our patient’s extreme obesity, we took the precaution of stopping lidocaine/ketamine and dexmedetomidine infusions 25 minutes before the end of surgery upon awakening. Propofol was discontinued immediately after surgery finished, and neuromuscular relaxation by rocuronium was reversed with sugammadex until 100% TOF was achieved. The patient was extubated in a semisitting position when the BIS was greater than 90, extubation criteria were achieved, and she was alert. The patient was transferred from the semisitting position to the ICU, and further postoperative monitoring was performed.\n\nMultimodal analgesia with dexketoprofen, metamizole, and paracetamol was maintained during the postoperative period. In addition, continuous infusions of lidocaine, ketamine and dexmedetomidine at low doses were administered for 48 hours ( lidocaine at 0.5 mg/kg/hour, ketamine at 0.05 mg/kg/hour, and dexmedetomidine at 0.03 mcg/kg/hour ), and this regimen was maintained for 48 hours. Some authors have recommended the use of these infusions for up to 48–72 hours in the postoperative period in patients with chronic pain, opioid-induced hyperalgesia, and obese patients, reporting good results and minimal side effects [ 29 , 30 ].\n\nIn our medical center, we routinely use these infusions during the postoperative period of bariatric surgery, with good results, as described in the present clinical case. Also, our protocol includes haloperidol as an adjuvant analgesic medication with an opioid-sparing effect, as well as to reduce nausea and vomiting [ 31 ]. During follow-up, the patient remained stable, with an SpO2 of 95–96% and a pain score of less than 3/10 on the visual analog scale. She did not require rescue opioids and did not present with PONV, ileus or gastric dilatation. This result agrees with the published literature related to the OFA management in bariatric surgery [ 27 , 32 ]. The hospital stay was without cardiac, respiratory, or infectious complications. The patient was discharged after 11 days.\n\nThe experience of our institution and the review of the literature support that the use of OFAA-TIVA with multimodal analgesia in laparoscopic bariatric surgery in patients with extreme obesity could contribute to a positive impact on outcomes by reducing ventilatory and gastrointestinal complications and prolonging hospital stays with adequate pain control [ 8 , 32 – 35 ].\n\nConclusion\n\nOpioid-free anesthesia/analgesia with propofol/lidocaine/ketamine and dexmedetomidine, in combination with multimodal analgesia, appears to be a safe and effective option in patients with extremely incapacitant morbid obesity who are undergoing bariatric surgery.Its benefits may include a lower risk of PONV and respiratory depression, adequate pain control and faster postoperative recovery, reducing ICU stay. However, more prospective research is needed to validate these findings with a greater number of patients with very high BMI.",
