  "abstract": "Objective: The present analysis of the Surgical Treatment for Ischemic Heart Failure randomized trial data examined the left ventricular volumes at baseline and 4 months after surgery to determine whether any magnitude of postoperative reduction in end-systolic volume affected survival after coronary artery bypass grafting alone compared with bypass grafting plus surgical ventricular reconstruction.\n\nMethods: Of the 1000 patients randomized, 555 underwent an operation and had a paired imaging assessment with the same modality at baseline and 4 months postoperatively. Of the remaining 455 patients, 424 either died before the 4-month study or did not have paired imaging tests and were excluded, and 21 were not considered because they had died before surgery or did not receive surgery.\n\nResults: Surgical ventricular reconstruction resulted in improved survival compared with coronary artery bypass grafting alone when the postoperative end-systolic volume index was 70 mL/m 2 or less. However, the opposite was true for patients achieving a postoperative volume index greater than 70 mL/m 2 . A reduction in the end-systolic volume index of 30% or more compared with baseline was an infrequent event in both treatment groups and did not produce a statistically significant survival benefit with ventricular reconstruction.\n\nConclusions: In patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting plus surgical ventricular reconstruction, a survival benefit was realized compared with bypass alone, with the achievement of a postoperative end-systolic volume index of 70 mL/m 2 or less. Extensive ventricular remodeling at baseline might limit the ability of ventricular reconstruction to achieve a sufficient reduction in volume and clinical benefit.",
