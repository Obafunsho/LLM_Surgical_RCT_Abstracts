  "full_text": "Introduction\n\nLung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide and imposes a significant burden on healthcare systems. Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounts for approximately 85% of all cases [ 1 ], with 20–25% of patients diagnosed at a resectable stage [ 2 ]. Neoadjuvant chemoimmunotherapy (NCIT) has been shown to improve survival outcomes in patients with resectable NSCLC by increasing R0 resection rates and eliminating micrometastatic disease [ 3 ]. The advent of immunotherapy (IT) has significantly transformed perioperative treatment strategies for resectable NSCLC. Clinical trials such as CheckMate-816 [ 4 ], AEGEAN [ 5 ], KEYNOTE-671 [ 6 ], and CheckMate-77 T [ 7 ] have demonstrated that the addition of programmed death 1 (PD-1) or programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) inhibitors to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NCT) significantly improves the pathological complete response (pCR) rates and event-free survival (EFS). Based on these findings, NCIT has been incorporated into the first-line treatment recommendations of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines [ 8 ]. However, a consensus has not yet been established regarding postoperative adjuvant therapy strategies following NCIT. A recent study [ 9 ] conducted an individual patient-level analysis, based on data from the CheckMate-816 and CheckMate-77 T trials, to compare perioperative (neoadjuvant plus adjuvant) nivolumab with neoadjuvant-only nivolumab. This analysis demonstrated that perioperative nivolumab further improved EFS compared with neoadjuvant nivolumab alone. Subgroup analysis suggested that patients who did not achieve a pCR after neoadjuvant nivolumab therapy appeared to benefit more from adjuvant therapy. However, another meta-analysis [ 10 ] that synthesized currently available clinical trial data compared the efficacy and safety of neoadjuvant-adjuvant anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy with those of neoadjuvant-only anti-PD-1 therapy in patients with resectable NSCLC. These findings indicate that the addition of adjuvant PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors following NCIT may not significantly improve survival outcomes in resectable NSCLC and could potentially lead to an increased incidence of adverse events. Therefore, further research is needed to determine whether the addition of postoperative adjuvant therapy to NCIT could provide survival benefits.\n\nSurgery followed by adjuvant immunotherapy (AIT) represents another perioperative treatment option for resectable NSCLC. In the IMpower010 study [ 11 ], 5-year follow-up data demonstrated that atezolizumab prolonged median disease-free survival (DFS) by 31.2 months compared with best supportive care in patients with stage II–IIIA NSCLC and PD-L1 tumor cell (TC) expression of ≥ 1% (hazard ratio (HR): 0.70, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.55–0.91). Similarly, the KEYNOTE-091 study [ 12 ] demonstrated a significant improvement in the median DFS among patients with stage II–IIIA NSCLC treated with pembrolizumab compared with placebo (median: 53.6 vs. 42.0 months; HR: 0.76, 95% CI 0.63–0.91; P = 0.0014). Based on these findings, adjuvant atezolizumab (for patients with a PD-L1 TC expression of ≥ 1%) or pembrolizumab has also been included in the NCCN guidelines [ 13 ], expanding the treatment options available for patients with resectable NSCLC. However, the comparative efficacy of NCIT versus upfront surgery (US) followed by AIT remains unclear.\n\nTherefore, the present study aimed to compare the prognostic differences among various postoperative adjuvant treatment strategies, in order to contribute to the ongoing discussion on postoperative treatment selection in the perioperative management of NSCLC.\n\nMaterials and methods\n\nPatient selection\n\nThis retrospective study included patients with stage IB to IIIB NSCLC who underwent surgery after NCIT or US + AIT at Shandong Cancer Hospital between January 2019 and February 2024. Patients (1) aged between 18 and 75 years, (2) with histologically confirmed stage IB–IIIB NSCLC (assessed according to the 9th edition of the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer Thoracic Oncology Staging Manual [ 14 ]), and (3) who received at least one cycle of chemotherapy (ChT) combined with IT followed by radical surgery or at least one cycle of AIT following US were eligible for the study. Meanwhile, patients with (1) mutations in epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK), or c-ros oncogene 1 (ROS1) driver genes; (2) histologically confirmed small cell or neuroendocrine lung cancer; (3) presence of other primary malignancies; or (4) a history of receiving other systemic antitumor therapies were excluded. Pre-treatment evaluations included bronchoscopy or percutaneous lung biopsy, contrast-enhanced computed tomography, 99 mTc-methylene diphosphonate bone scintigraphy, and brain magnetic resonance imaging. Demographic characteristics and treatment-related data were extracted from the hospital’s electronic medical records system. This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Shandong Cancer Hospital and conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. During the data collection phase of the study, communicating with participants and obtaining their consent. The requirement for written informed consent for the use of electronic medical records was waived.\n\nTreatment\n\nThe decision to proceed with NCIT or US was made by the hospital’s multi-disciplinary treatment team. The NCIT regimen consisted of 2–4 cycles of platinum-based doublet ChT combined with either PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitors. Most patients (97.2%) received a PD-1 inhibitor, while only 2.8% received a PD-L1 inhibitor. Chemotherapy regimens consisted of platinum plus a taxane for squamous cell carcinoma, and platinum combined with either pemetrexed or a taxane for adenocarcinoma. Radical resection was performed within 4–8 weeks following the completion of NCIT. Surgical procedures included pneumonectomy, lobectomy, or sleeve resection, accompanied by comprehensive dissection of the hilar and mediastinal lymph nodes. The adjuvant therapy regimen administered following NCIT was determined by the attending physician or guided by the clinical trial protocol in which the patient was enrolled. Based on the adjuvant therapies administered following NCIT, the patients were categorized into the no-treatment, ChT (1–4 cycles of platinum-based doublet ChT), IT (at least one cycle of PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitors), and chemoimmunotherapy (ChIT; at least one cycle of platinum-based ChT or ChT combined with PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitors, followed by PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitors) groups. Additionally, patients who underwent US received 2–4 cycles of platinum-based doublet ChT, followed by at least one cycle of adjuvant PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitors.\n\nPathological assessment, follow-up and study endpoints\n\npCR and MPR were centrally reviewed by two independent board-certified thoracic pathologists. All histological slides were digitally scanned and uploaded to a secure central reading platform, where the two pathologists performed blinded, parallel evaluations. Any discrepancies were resolved by a third senior thoracic pathologist. Throughout the entire review process, treatment allocation was concealed: slides were labeled only with anonymous study identifiers and contained no therapeutic information, and the pathologists had no access to clinical data or operative reports.\n\nThe follow-up period for patients extended from the initial treatment to the final follow-up cut-off date (February 28, 2025) or death. During the first 2 years post-surgery, imaging assessments and follow-ups were conducted every 3 months, with the interval extended to every 6 months thereafter. The primary endpoints were EFS and overall survival (OS). EFS was defined as the interval from the start of initial treatment to the first occurrence of disease progression, recurrence, or death from any cause. OS was defined as the interval from the start of initial treatment to death from any cause.\n\nStatistical analysis\n\nDescriptive analyses of categorical variables before and after treatment were performed using the chi-square test or Fisher’s exact test. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate the follow-up time, EFS, and OS, whereas the log-rank test was used to compare the differences in EFS and OS between the groups. Multiple comparisons in Benjamini-Hochberg (BH) procedure. To adjust for potential confounding factors, propensity score matching (PSM) was performed between the IT and ChIT groups after NCIT. Propensity scores were calculated using a logistic regression model incorporating covariates, such as age, sex, histology, clinical stage, pathological response, and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group score. Based on the estimated propensity scores, caliper matching was applied using a caliper width of 0.02 to achieve a 1:1 match between the two groups. A P or an adjusted P value of < 0.05 was considered significant. All statistical analyses were conducted using SPSS software (version 27.0, IBM Corporation), whereas survival curves were generated using Prism software (version 10.1.2, GraphPad).\n\nResults\n\nBaseline characteristics\n\nThis study included 285 patients with NSCLC who underwent NCIT. Among them, 46 did not receive adjuvant treatment, 38 received adjuvant ChT alone, 33 received adjuvant IT alone, and 168 received adjuvant ChIT. Furthermore, 32 patients who underwent US followed by AIT were included in this study. In the NCIT group, 87% of the patients were men, compared with 90.6% in the US + AIT group ( P = 0.780). Squamous cell carcinoma was identified in 66.3% of patients in the NCIT group and 62.5% of those in the US + AIT group ( P = 0.696). A PD-L1 expression of ≥ 1% was observed in 48.8% of patients in the NCIT group and 81.2% of those in the US + AIT group ( P < 0.001). Further details of the patient characteristics are presented in Table 1 . No significant differences were found among the no-treatment, ChT, IT, and ChIT groups. The baseline characteristics of the IT and ChIT groups after PSM are shown in Supplementary Table 1.\n\nSurvival analysis in the whole population\n\nThe median follow-up period for all patients was 30.7 months. No significant differences were found in EFS between the ChT and no-treatment groups (Fig. 1 a), the no-treatment and US + AIT groups (Fig. 1 d), and the IT and ChIT groups (Fig. 1 e). Both the IT (HR: 2.27, 95% CI 1.09–4.71, P = 0.0417) and ChIT groups (HR: 1.68, 95% CI 0.94–3.01, P = 0.0441) showed significantly improved EFS compared with the no-treatment group. However, no significant differences remained after adjustment ( Adjusted P = 0.0772 and 0.0772; Fig. 1 b, c). The 1- and 2-year EFS rates were 81.82% and 78.55%, respectively, in the IT group and 82.74 and 72.54%, respectively, in the ChIT group. These values were notably higher than the 1- and 2-year EFS rates of 78.26 and 64.38%, respectively, in the no-treatment group (Fig. 1 b, c). Additionally, the EFS in the IT (HR: 2.36, 95% CI 1.06–5.27, P = 0.0396) and ChIT (HR: 1.92, 95% CI 0.96–3.83, P = 0.0211) groups was significantly superior to that in the US + AIT group. However, after adjustment, the results did not meet the criterion for significance ( Adjusted P = 0.0772 and 0.0772; Fig. 1 f, g).\n\nThe OS results were consistent with those of the EFS, with no significant differences between the ChT and no-treatment groups (Fig. 2 a), the no-treatment and US + AIT groups (Fig. 2 d), or the IT and ChIT groups (Fig. 2 e). Both the IT (HR: 2.44, 95% CI: 1.01–5.89, Adjusted P = 0.1292; Fig. 2 b) and ChIT (HR: 1.99, 95% CI: 0.98–4.02, Adjusted P = 0.1292; Fig. 2 c) groups exhibited a trend toward improved OS compared with the no-treatment group, as well as the IT group compared with the US + AIT group (HR: 2.68, 95% CI: 1.04–6.95, Adjusted P = 0.1292; Fig. 2 f). Compared with the no-treatment group, which demonstrated 1- and 2-year OS rates of 82.61 and 69.77%, respectively, both the IT (87.88 and 84.50%, respectively) and ChIT groups (89.88 and 80.82%, respectively) achieved higher OS outcomes at both time points (Fig. 2 b, c). Notably, the ChIT group demonstrated a significant OS benefit compared with the US + AIT group (HR: 1.95, 95% CI 0.87–4.36, P = 0.0432), which, however, was no longer significant after adjustment ( Adjusted P = 0.1292; Fig. 2 g).\n\nSurvival analysis after PSM between the IT and the ChIT groups\n\nFollowing 1:1 PSM between the IT and ChIT groups, the ChIT group continued to demonstrate significantly improved EFS compared with the no-treatment group (HR: 2.28, 95% CI 1.10–4.72, P = 0.0408) and the US + AIT group (HR: 2.42, 95% CI 1.08–5.41, P = 0.0345). However, no significant differences were observed after adjustment ( Adjusted P = 0.0730 and 0.0730; Fig. 3 a, c). Moreover, no significant differences were observed in EFS between the ChIT group and IT group (Fig. 3 b). In terms of OS, no significant improvement was observed in the ChIT group compared with the IT group (Fig. 3 e). However, a trend toward prolonged OS was noted in comparison to the no-treatment group (HR: 2.41, 95% CI 1.00–5.82, Adjusted P = 0.1367; Fig. 3 d) and US + AIT group (HR: 2.67, 95% CI 1.03–6.93, Adjusted P = 0.1367; Fig. 3 f).\n\nSubgroup analysis of pathological response\n\nIn the subgroup analysis of patients who did not achieve pCR following NCIT, both the IT (HR: 2.96, 95% CI 1.20–7.28, P = 0.0256) and ChIT (HR: 2.95, 95% CI 1.20–7.24, P = 0.0275) groups demonstrated significantly improved EFS compared with the no-treatment group. However, none of these differences remained statistically significant after adjustment ( Adjusted P = 0.0550 and 0.0550; Fig. 4 b, c). No significant differences were observed in EFS between the ChT and no-treatment groups (Fig. 4 a), or the IT and ChIT groups (Fig. 4 d). Among patients who achieved pCR after receiving NCIT, no significant differences were found in EFS among various adjuvant treatment strategies (Fig. 4 e–h). Among patients who did not achieve pCR following NCIT, the IT group showed a trend toward improved OS compared with the no-treatment group (HR: 3.08, 95% CI 1.04–9.13, Adjusted P = 0.2856; Fig. 5 b). Meanwhile, no significant differences were observed in OS among the remaining adjuvant treatment groups (Fig. 5 a, c, d). Among patients who achieved a pCR after NCIT, consistent with the findings of the EFS analysis, no significant differences were observed in OS among the adjuvant treatment groups (Fig. 5 e–h). When patients who received NCIT were stratified into major pathological response (MPR) and non-MPR subgroups based on pathological response, the EFS and OS outcomes in these subgroups were consistent with those observed in the pCR and non-pCR subgroups (Supplementary Figs. 1, 2).\n\nSubgroup analysis of PD-L1 expression level\n\nIn the subgroup of patients with a PD-L1 expression of < 1%, both the IT (HR: 3.88, 95% CI 1.36–11.04, Adjusted P = 0.1046; Supplementary Fig. 3b) and ChIT (HR: 3.18, 95% CI 1.18–8.58, Adjusted P = 0.1046; Supplementary Fig. 3c) groups demonstrated a non-significant trend toward improved EFS compared with the no-treatment group. No significant differences were found in EFS observed among the various adjuvant therapy groups within this subgroup (Supplementary Figs. 3a, d). Among patients with a PD-L1 expression of ≥ 1%, the findings were consistent with those observed in the overall population. Compared with the no-treatment group, both the IT (HR: 3.55, 95% CI: 1.08–11.73, P = 0.0445) and ChIT (HR: 3.59, 95% CI: 1.09–11.85, P = 0.0426) groups were associated with significantly prolonged EFS. However, neither IT ( adjusted P = 0.0779; Supplementary Fig. 3f) nor ChIT groups ( adjusted P = 0.0779; Supplementary Fig. 3 g) retained statistical significance after adjustment. Furthermore, both groups showed improved EFS compared with the US + AIT group (HR: 3.67, 95% CI 1.37–9.82, Adjusted P = 0.0779; HR: 3.74, 95% CI 1.40–9.99, Adjusted P = 0.0779; Supplementary Figs. 3j, k). No significant differences were identified in EFS among the remaining adjuvant therapy groups following NCIT or US treatment (Supplementary Figs. 3e, h, i). With regard to OS, no significant differences were found among the various adjuvant therapy groups within the subgroup with a PD-L1 expression of < 1% (Supplementary Fig. 4a–d). However, within the subgroup with a PD-L1 expression of ≥ 1%, a trend toward improved OS was observed in the IT group compared with the US + AIT group (HR: 3.54, 95% CI 1.08–11.64, Adjusted P = 0.2569; Supplementary Fig. 4j). However, no other significant differences in OS were detected among the remaining adjuvant therapy groups following NCIT or US treatment (Supplementary Fig. 4e–i, k).\n\nSubgroup analysis of stage\n\nIn the subgroup analysis stratified by stage, both the IT (HR: 3.51, 95% CI 1.23–10.91, P = 0.0439; HR: 3.39, 95% CI 1.30–8.89, P = 0.0408) and ChIT (HR: 3.09, 95% CI 1.03–9.29, P = 0.0454; HR: 3.34, 95% CI 1.27–8.75, P = 0.0439) groups exhibited significantly improved EFS compared with the no-treatment group among patients with stage IB–IIB or stage IIIA–IIIB disease. However, after adjustment, statistical significance was lost for both IT ( adjusted P = 0.1859 and 0.1250; Supplementary Fig. 5b, i) and ChIT ( adjusted P = 0.1589 and 0.1250; Supplementary Fig. 5c, j). This result is consistent with the findings in the overall population. Furthermore, the IT group demonstrated a trend toward improved EFS compared with the US + AIT group (HR: 3.01, 95% CI 0.86–10.49, Adjusted P = 0.1803; HR: 2.97, 95% CI 0.96–9.22, Adjusted P = 0.1250; Supplementary Fig. 5f, m) in both the stage IB–IIB and IIIA–IIIB subgroups, whereas the ChIT group demonstrated a similar trend in the stage IIIA–IIIB subgroup (HR: 3.20, 95% CI: 1.03–9.94, Adjusted P = 0.1250; Supplementary Fig. 5n). No significant differences were observed in EFS among the remaining adjuvant therapy groups after NCIT or US treatment (Supplementary Fig. 5a, d, e, g, h, k, l). In terms of OS, no significant differences were found among the various adjuvant therapy groups in either the stage IB–IIB or IIIA–IIIB subgroups following NCIT or US treatment (Supplementary Fig. 6).\n\nSubgroup analysis of PD-1 inhibitors\n\nIn the subgroup of patients with PD-1 inhibitors, the findings were consistent with those observed in the overall population. Both the IT (HR: 2.87, 95% CI 1.33–6.20, P = 0.0176) and ChIT groups (HR: 2.51, 95% CI 1.18–5.35, P = 0.0286) showed significantly improved EFS compared with the no-treatment group. Similarly, no significant differences remained after adjustment ( Adjusted P = 0.0667 and 0.0667; Supplementary Fig. 7b, c). Additionally, the EFS in the IT (HR: 2.85, 95% CI 1.18–6.87, P = 0.0242) and ChIT (HR: 2.48, 95% CI 1.05–5.86, P = 0.0423) groups was superior to that in the US + AIT group. However, no significant differences remained after adjustment ( Adjusted P = 0.0667 and 0.0740; Supplementary Fig. 7f, g). No significant differences were found in EFS between the ChT and no-treatment groups (Supplementary Fig. 7a), the no-treatment and US + AIT groups (Supplementary Fig. 7d), and the IT and ChIT groups (Supplementary Fig. 7e). As for OS, the results were also consistent with those observed in the overall population (Supplementary Fig. 8).\n\nDiscussion\n\nThis study comprehensively evaluated the efficacy of various adjuvant treatment regimens for patients with resectable NSCLC in the perioperative setting. Both before and after PSM, postoperative IT or ChIT may be associated with potiential survival benefits compared with no adjuvant treatment. Subgroup analysis further revealed that among patients who did not achieve pCR following NCIT and exhibited a PD-L1 expression of ≥ 1%, adjuvant IT or ChIT could improve EFS compared with no-treatment. Moreover, adjuvant ChIT following NCIT demonstrated an improvement in EFS compared with US + AIT. These findings support the emerging paradigm of integrating neoadjuvant and postoperative IT as a potiential standard strategy and further increase the discussion on adjuvant therapy choices within the perioperative management of NSCLC.\n\nBoth the CheckMate-816 trial and phase II studies such as LungMate 002 [ 15 ], TD-FOREKNOW [ 16 ], and neoSCORE [ 17 ] demonstrated that NCIT leads to higher pathological response rates and improved long-term survival compared with NCT alone in patients with resectable NSCLC. However, the potential benefit of administering PD-1 inhibitors in both the pre- and postoperative phases, as opposed to preoperative treatment alone, remains uncertain. Two meta-analyses [ 18 , 19 ] based on indirect comparisons found that the addition of PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitors during the adjuvant phase, following NCIT with PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors and ChT, did not confer additional survival benefits. By contrast, the present study demonstrated that AIT administered following NCIT improved EFS compared with no adjuvant therapy. This discrepancy may be attributable to differences in data sources, statistical methods, the specific PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors used, and variations in clinicopathological factors among the study population. Therefore, head-to-head randomized controlled trials are warranted to further elucidate the value of AIT in patients with resectable NSCLC who have received NCIT.\n\nMoreover, in the context of patient stratification, whether patients who achieve pCR after neoadjuvant IT should receive AIT remains a critical and ongoing subject of debate within the pathological response subgroups. Approximately 17–40% of patients achieved pCR following NCIT [ 20 , 21 ]. Recently, the Journal of Thoracic Oncology published two editorials presenting opposing viewpoints on this issue. One editorial [ 22 ] advocated for the administration of additional AIT in patients who achieved pCR after NCIT. This is based on the premise that achieving pCR does not necessarily indicate a definitive cure, as a subset of these patients may still experience disease recurrence. A propensity score–weighted comparative analysis of the CheckMate-77 T and CheckMate-816 trials further demonstrated that the risk of postoperative recurrence was reduced by approximately 40% with perioperative nivolumab therapy compared with neoadjuvant nivolumab plus ChT alone. Therefore, in the absence of sufficient evidence to support treatment de-escalation, the continuation of a full course of perioperative therapy remains a reasonable approach and serves as a key reference for determining the optimal IT duration in this setting. By contrast, another editorial [ 23 ] argued that patients who achieve pCR following NCIT can attain excellent long-term survival outcomes, therefore negating the need for additional postoperative IT. In the most recent update of the CheckMate-816 trial, a 4-year OS rate of 95% was observed among patients who received NCIT and achieved pCR, underscoring the impracticality of conducting clinical trials to compare neoadjuvant versus perioperative IT in this specific context. Furthermore, a comparative analysis between CheckMate-816 and CheckMate-77 T trials was discussed in the editorial, revealing that although perioperative IT was associated with a reduced risk of recurrence compared with neoadjuvant IT in patients who achieved pCR, no significant difference was observed in EFS between the two groups (HR: 0.58; 95% CI 0.14–2.40) [ 24 ]. The potential risk of adverse events associated with adjuvant components of perioperative IT should not be overlooked. Given the wide confidence interval and excellent overall prognosis of this subgroup, the current findings do not provide sufficient evidence to support the routine use of AIT in patients who have achieved pCR. Our subgroup analysis similarly demonstrated that, among patients who achieved pCR after NCIT, no significant difference was noted in EFS or OS between those who received adjuvant IT or ChIT and those who did not. Although patients who achieve pCR may still be at risk of recurrence or metastasis due to factors such as undetectable residual tumor cells or inter-observer variability in pathological assessment, several clinical studies have consistently shown that patients achieving pCR tend to experience excellent long-term survival outcomes. Additionally, current evidence suggests that perioperative IT does not provide additional survival benefits compared with preoperative IT alone in patients who achieved pCR. Therefore, in the absence of definitive evidence supporting AIT in this population, a uniform, one-size-fits-all approach to postoperative IT administration for all patients who achieved pCR is not warranted.\n\nOur study suggests that patients who fail to achieve a pCR after NCIT may derive survival benefits from AIT. However, this raises an important question: why might patients who appear relatively resistant to immunotherapy during the neoadjuvant phase still respond to it in the adjuvant setting? The possible explanations are as follows: Firstly, tissue-resident memory T cells (Trm) may play a critical role in sustaining the immune response following AIT. Trm cells are long-lived memory T cells that reside in tissues and function as frontline sentinels in antitumor immunity, with roles in rapid response, direct cytotoxicity, local immune memory maintenance, and tumor microenvironment remodeling. A study by Hu et al. [ 25 ] demonstrated that the proportion of Trm cells significantly increased after neoadjuvant immunotherapy in patients with NSCLC who did not achieve MPR. This suggests that tumor-associated antigens continue to elicit T-cell responses and that immune resistance is not absolute. Moreover, following resection of the primary tumor, micrometastatic foci—no longer shielded by high tumor burden—may become more visible to and eliminated by Trm cells. Secondly, circulating tumor cells (CTCs) may display molecular profiles distinct from those of the primary tumor. Gu et al. [ 26 ] reported that approximately 15% of breast cancer patients exhibited human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) amplification in CTCs that was absent in the primary lesion. Similarly, Onstenk et al. [ 27 ] found discordant estrogen receptor (ER) expression between CTCs and primary tumors in metastatic breast cancer, while Koh et al. [ 28 ] observed heterogeneous PD-L1 expression on CTCs compared with matched tumor tissue in lung cancer. Together, these findings suggest that residual micrometastatic lesions may carry resistance-related genetic or phenotypic alterations not found in the primary tumor, potentially leading to differential responses to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) between postoperative residual micrometastases and the primary tumor. Moreover, in this study, patients who exhibited progressive disease during NCIT, as assessed by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors 1.1 (RECIST 1.1), were excluded. The remaining patients not only met the RECIST criteria for clinical benefit (complete response, CR/partial response, PR/stable disease, SD), but approximately 56% of those in the SD subgroup also achieved a MPR. Therefore, the majority of patients who did not achieve a pCR cannot be classified as treatment-resistant. Lastly, immunotherapy is characterized by a delayed onset of efficacy, with the development of a robust antitumor immune response typically requiring weeks to months. Once established, however, such responses are often associated with durable survival benefits. In summary, these lines of evidence support the conclusion that even patients who fail to achieve a pCR following NCIT may still derive survival benefit from continued adjuvant immunotherapy.\n\nIn this study, no significant survival differences were observed between AIT and adjuvant ChIT following NCIT. This finding suggests that ChT administered during the neoadjuvant phase may be sufficient. Additional postoperative ChT may not provide further benefits and could potentially increase treatment-related toxicities.\n\nPD-L1 expression is a valuable biomarker for predicting the efficacy of IT. In the PD-L1 subgroup analysis, patients with a PD-L1 expression of ≥ 1% experienced a EFS benefit from perioperative IT compared with neoadjuvant IT alone. In patients with a PD-L1 expression of < 1%, perioperative IT showed a trend toward improved EFS. However, a comparative analysis of the CheckMate-816 and CheckMate-77 T trials showed that only patients with a PD-L1 expression of < 1% appeared to benefit from AIT. This discrepancy may stem from limited sample sizes, variability in PD-L1 testing methods, and the inherent limitations of current assessment techniques—such as needle biopsy—which may not fully capture the tumor’s overall PD-L1 expression status. Further studies are needed to elucidate the value of PD-L1 expression in guiding postoperative adjuvant strategies in the perioperative setting.\n\nThe IMpower010 and KEYNOTE-091 trials established AIT as an effective perioperative treatment strategy for resectable NSCLC. However, no study has directly compared the efficacy of US + AIT with NCIT. In our study, among patients with a PD-L1 expression of ≥ 1%, those treated with US + AIT demonstrated a lower EFS compared with those who received NCIT followed by either adjuvant IT or ChIT. This finding further highlights the therapeutic advantages of integrating neoadjuvant and adjuvant IT in the perioperative management of NSCLC. Nonetheless, although the baseline characteristics were similar between the groups, several key surgical assessment factors—such as encasement of major vessels—that influence the choice between NCIT and US were not accounted for. Therefore, the clinical and pathological profiles of these two patient groups may not have been entirely comparable.\n\nOur study has some limitations. Firstly, the number of patients in each adjuvant treatment group was relatively small, making it difficult to draw definitive conclusions. Secondly, the NCIT regimens administered to patients in this study were highly heterogeneous, including the types of drugs, dosages, and treatment cycles without standardization. Similarly, the postoperative adjuvant treatment strategies (ChT, IT, or ChIT) also exhibited considerable variability, which may have affected the results. Additionally, the duration of postoperative adjuvant treatment differed substantially among the patients in the ChT, IT, and ChIT groups, potentially influencing the interpretation of study outcomes. Thirdly, in the retrospective study, ctDNA, CTCs or molecular residual disease assays were not employed to quantify postoperative tumor burden, precluding dynamic monitoring of residual disease and thus limiting the ability to optimize postoperative immunotherapy strategies. So the study lacked sufficient control over the immunologic sensitivity of minimal residual disease following NCIT. Finally, the limited number of patients in each subgroup led to wide confidence intervals for the hazard ratios of EFS. Additionally, the relatively short median follow-up period may have contributed to discrepancies between EFS and OS in some subgroup analyses. It also remains unclear whether the findings of this study will be sustained in 5-year OS outcomes. These limitations underscore the necessity for future prospective studies to validate the efficacy and safety of various adjuvant treatments, better identify target populations, and optimize perioperative treatment strategies.\n\nIn conclusion, our results suggest that for resectable NSCLC, both AIT and adjuvant ChIT following NCIT are expected to improve EFS compared with no-teatment, particularly in patients with a PD-L1 expression of ≥ 1% and those who did not achieve a pCR. NCIT followed by either AIT or adjuvant ChIT may be associated with favorable survival outcomes compared with US with AIT in patients with positive PD-L1 expression. These results may contribute to ongoing discussions regarding optimal postoperative adjuvant strategies in the perioperative management of NSCLC. Further prospective studies are warranted to refine patient selection.\n\nSupplementary Information\n\nBelow is the link to the electronic supplementary material.
