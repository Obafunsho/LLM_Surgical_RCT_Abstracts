  "title": "Efficacy of immediate lymphatic reconstruction to decrease incidence of breast cancer-related lymphedema: preliminary results of randomized controlled trial",
  "abstract": "Objective:: To conduct a randomized controlled trial (RCT) on the efficacy of immediate lymphatic reconstruction (ILR) for decreasing the incidence of breast cancer-related lymphedema (BCRL) after axillary lymph node dissection (ALND).\n\nSummary Background Data:: Despite encouraging results in small studies, an appropriately powered RCT on ILR has not been performed.\n\nMethods:: Women undergoing ALND for breast cancer were randomized in the operating room 1:1 to either ILR, if technically feasible, or no ILR (control). ILR group underwent lymphatic anastomosis to a regional vein using microsurgical techniques; control group had no repair and cut lymphatics were ligated. Relative volume change (RVC), bioimpedance, quality of life (QoL), and compression use were evaluated at baseline and every 6 months postoperatively up to 24 months. Indocyanine green (ICG) lymphography was performed at baseline and at 12 and 24 months postoperatively. Primary outcome was incidence of BCRL, defined as ≥10% RVC from baseline in the affected extremity at 12-, 18-, or 24-month follow-up.\n\nResults:: Of 72 patients randomized to ILR and 72 to control from January 2020 to March 2023, our preliminary analysis includes 99 patients with 12-month follow-up, 70 with 18-month follow-up, and 40 with 24-month follow-up. Cumulative incidence of BCRL was 9.5% in the ILR group and 32% in the control group (p=0.014). ILR group had lower bioimpedance values, decreased compression usage, better lymphatic function on ICG lymphography, and better QoL than the control group.\n\nConclusions:: Preliminary results of our RCT show that ILR after ALND decreases BCRL incidence. Our goal is to finish accrual of 174 patients with 24-month follow-up.",
