  "title": "Treatment of Carotid Stenosis in Asymptomatic, Non-Octogenarian, Standard Risk Patients with Stenting versus Endarterectomy Trials",
  "abstract": "Background:: Asymptomatic carotid stenosis is the most frequent indication for carotid endarterectomy (CEA) in the United States. Published trials and guidelines support CEA indications in selected patients with longer projected survival and when periprocedural complications are low. Transfemoral carotid artery stenting with embolic protection (CAS) is a newer treatment option.\n\nObjective:: To compare outcomes in asymptomatic, non-octogenarian patients treated with CAS versus CEA.\n\nMethods:: Patient-level data was analyzed from 2544 subjects with ≥70% asymptomatic carotid stenosis who were randomized to CAS or CEA in addition to standard medical therapy. One trial enrolled 1091 (548 CAS, 543 CEA) and another enrolled 1453 (1089 CAS, 364 CEA) asymptomatic patients less than 80 years old (upper age eligibility). Independent neurologic assessment and routine cardiac enzyme screening were performed. The pre-specified, primary composite endpoint was any stroke, myocardial infarction, or death during the periprocedural period or ipsilateral stroke within 4 years after randomization.\n\nResults:: There was no significant difference in the primary endpoint between CAS and CEA (5.3% and 5.1%, hazard ratio (HR) = 1.02; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.7–1.5; P=.91). Periprocedural rates for the components are (CAS vs CEA): any stroke (2.7% vs. 1.5%, P=.07), myocardial infarction (0.6% vs. 1.7%, P=.01), death (0.1% vs 0.2%, P=.62), and any stroke or death (2.7% vs 1.6%, P=.07). After this period, the rates of ipsilateral stroke were similar (2.3% vs. 2.2%, P=.97).\n\nConclusions:: In pooled analysis of the two large randomized trials of CAS and CEA in asymptomatic, non-octogenarian patients, CAS achieves comparable short and long term results to CEA.",
