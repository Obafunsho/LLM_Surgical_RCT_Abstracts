  "full_text": "Material and Methods\n\nClinicalTrials.gov is a website maintained by the National Library of Medicine that provides information on current clinical research studies in more than 200 countries. 8 The database relies on study investigators to submit updated information during the course of their study and encourages public sharing of the research process and eventual outputs. The ClinicalTrials.gov database was queried to identify all registered RCTs in patients with lung cancer who underwent surgery (any technique) as part of their treatment performed until April 27, 2023. Inclusion criteria included “lung neoplasm” as a MESH condition term and contained at least one of the following terms in the keywords or official titles: “surgery,” “surgical,” “lobectomy,” “thoracotomy,” “thoracoscopic,” “VATS,” “robot,” “segmentectomy,” or “resection.” The query was limited to randomized trials only with treatment as the primary purpose and procedure or device as the intervention type ( Figure 1 ). Exclusion criteria included nonrandomized trials and trials with basic science, diagnostic, health services, prevention, or supportive care as the primary purposes. Trials with medical-focused primary outcomes were excluded, even if they enrolled surgical patients. After initial selection based on title and abstract review, each study underwent full-text review to ensure inclusion criteria was uniformly met.\n\nThe cohort was stratified by overall status, including active but not recruiting, completed, not yet recruiting, recruiting, stopped, and unknown. Characteristics of the studies were extracted, including start and completion dates, masking, number of participating facilities, lead sponsors, comparison types, number of arms, and numbers of actual and anticipated enrollment. Studies were also stratified by country and continent of origin based on overall status. A subgroup analysis was performed for the completed studies and time to trial completion and rate and timing of subsequent publication were collected. Additional analysis was performed to understand characteristics of trials with unknown status. Frequencies and percentages were calculated for categorical variables, and means (SD) were calculated for continuous variables. All analyses were performed using R 4.2.2.\n\nResults\n\nThere were 68 studies that met the inclusion criteria, and of these, 21 (30.9%) had been completed, 20 (29.4%) were still recruiting, 17 (25%) were unknown, 4 (5.9%) were active but not recruiting, 4 (5.9%) were stopped, and 2 (2.9%) were not yet recruiting ( Figure 2 ). The 4 studies labeled as “stopped” were all discontinued due to issues with enrollment and adequate patient accrual. Characteristics of the studies are shown in Tables 1 and E1 . Overall, 17 (25%) of the studies were initiated from the year 2010 and prior, 44 (64.7%) were open label, 43 (63.2%) were performed in a single facility, 52 (76.5%) were funded institutionally, and 66 (97.1%) had 2 arms. Thirty-four trials (50%) were not stage-specific, whereas 25 trials (36.8%) enrolled patients with early-stage lung cancer, 13 trials (19.1%) enrolled patients with locally advanced disease, and 1 trial (1.5%) enrolled patients with late-stage disease. Figure 3 illustrates the initiation of RCTs by time period. The uptick in RCTs starting in 2016 is associated with the increase in single facility studies, with more than 72% of all RCTs recorded as single institution in the period from 2016 to 2023. More specifically, the majority (78.1%) of these single-facility RCTs were from Asia.\n\nFigure 4 shows the different categories of study of the 68 eligible RCTs. Thirty-three trials (48.5%) were intended to examine different perioperative patient management strategies (eg, analgesia, ventilation, drainage) or to examine different intraoperative technical aspects (eg, stapling, number of ports, port placement, ligation) ( Table E2 ). The remaining 35 studies examined modalities of lobectomy (eg, open surgery, video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery, robot-assisted), extent of lung resection, surgery with adjunct treatments, and surgery versus nonsurgical treatment. In the year 2000 and earlier, most of the studies (66.7%) focused on surgery and adjunct treatments. However, in more recent years, specifically from 2016 to the present day, study topics have shifted to include more patient management strategies and intraoperative technical management ( Table E3 ).\n\nAlthough some RCTs were performed in multiple continents, the highest number of studies were initiated in Asia (n = 34) ( Table E4 ). The remaining studies were relatively evenly split among Europe, North, and South America, with limited studies performed in Africa and Oceania. Europe had the highest rate of completed studies at 59%, especially compared with North and South America (28.6% and 30.8%, respectively), which all have a similar distribution of RCTs in each time period. On the other hand, Asia has the lowest rate of RCT completion to date (14.7%). This may be associated with the higher number of studies initiated in Asia from the year 2016 and beyond.\n\nIn a subgroup analysis focusing on the 21 completed studies alone, 10 (47.6%) were initiated before the year 2010, 10 (47.6%) were open-label studies, and 11 (52.4%) were conducted in a single facility. Of the 16 studies that reported enrollment numbers, the mean actual enrollment was lower than the anticipated enrollment at 256 patients (SD, 146) versus 349 patients (SD, 224), respectively. Specifically, there was on average 93 less patients enrolled in RCTs than originally anticipated, or a 26% mean reduction in actual enrollment. We calculated the time from start to completion of trials to investigate potential lags during the research process ( Table E5 ). The median primary completion date, or time at which the last data point for the primary outcome was collected from the last enrolled patient, was 1370 days (SD, 677, 2572), or 3.8 years. On the other hand, the median study completion date, defined as the last data point for all remaining outcome measures, was 1554 days (SD, 704, 3346), or 4.3 years. Of the 21 completed studies, 14 (66.7%) successfully published articles from results of their study and the average time from trial completion to publication was 2.9 years. Average journal impact factor from the year of publication of the published studies was 28.1 (range, 0.2-176.1; median, 6.2). This equates to an average of 8.7 years from trial registration to publication. Of the 2 broad categories as described above, RCTs that studied surgery in a more traditional fashion (open surgery vs video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery vs robot-assisted, types of lung resection, surgery with adjunct treatments, and surgery vs nonsurgical treatment) were published in higher-impact journals than RCTs that studied perioperative and intraoperative strategies (median impact factor 49.7 vs 7.6, respectively).\n\nThere were 17 of the 68 RCTs with their overall status recorded as “unknown” in the database. Of these 17 studies, 10 (59%) were from 2015 or earlier, 11 (65%) were open label, 12 (71%) were from a single facility, and 16 (94%) had 2 arms ( Table E6 ). The last updates of the overall status unknown RCTs were recruiting (11, 64.7%), not yet recruiting (4, 23.5%), active not recruiting (1, 5.9%), and enrolling by invitation (1, 5.9%). The median time from trial start to last update was 134 days (SD, −2, 972), and median time since trial start to the present data query in ClinicalTrials.gov in April 2023 was 2827 days (SD, 2461, 3891), or 7.7 years.\n\nDiscussion\n\nLung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer mortality around the world, and RCTs have historically been touted as the most important way to generate evidence to evolve clinical care. Our study assessed all surgical-related RCTs conducted in lung cancer and found 68 studies that met criteria over 30 years that covered a heterogenous range of topics. The number of RCTs was relatively stable over time until a large increase in RCTs starting in 2016, but this may be partially due to policy changes from entities such as the Food and Drug Administration and the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors to improve reporting into the ClinicalTrials.gov database. Nevertheless, we found that this increase in RCTs correlated with an increase in single-center trials after 2016 performed mostly in Asia. Of the 68 RCTs, the overall status was reported as completed in only 21 (30.9%), still recruiting in 20 (29.4%), and unknown in 17 (25.0%). Within the group of completed studies, time from trial start to completion was long at an average of 4 to 6 years, with an additional 1 to 5 years before an associated publication is identified. Within the group of “unknown” status studies, the median time from trial initiation to date of data extraction in April 2023 was 7.7 years, which suggests that these 17 studies have likely been abandoned or discontinued as a prior study using the ClinicalTrials.gov database demonstrated that the median time to study discontinuation is 2.2 years. 9\n\nOne of the motivations for the study we undertook was to scrutinize the practicality of the long-held belief that RCTs are the absolute gold standard for guiding clinical decision-making and affecting national and international recommendations in lung cancer. However, it is likely that RCTs studying differences in medical management are easier to conduct than surgical RCTs. Studies have suggested that pharmaceutical trials have a higher proportion of completed trials than device or procedural interventions. 10 , 11 In general, RCTs focused on chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and more recently immunotherapy for lung cancer are more common than surgery. 12 Consequently, there has been more scrutiny in increasing the value and efficacy of these trials over the last 2 decades. For example, the National Cancer Institute collaborates with civil societies to hold national symposiums to address issues such as trial redundancies and delays, but the majority of best practices developed are not applicable to surgical trials. 13 , 14 In the thoracic surgical space, efforts by societies such as the American Association for Thoracic Surgery are attempting to place surgeons in the center of the RCT discussion by creating a formal collaborative working group such as the Thoracic Surgical Oncology Group, which holds multiple levels of stakeholders accountable for successful completion of lung and esophageal cancer RCTs. By screening participating sites for adoption of best practices and confirming sites have experience in clinical research, it is hoped that trials within Thoracic Surgical Oncology Group will be higher quality. On a smaller scale, academic cancer centers such as MD Anderson have analyzed their institutional data on trial efficacy and success, and have found that cancer therapeutics trials fare better than nondrug trials. 15 , 16 Surgical-related trials present different challenges compared with medical and drug trials for reasons such as the rarity of certain surgical conditions, time constraints for operating schedules, patient preferences for surgical modalities and specific surgeons, and the variability of surgical proficiency and techniques. 17 In the United States specifically, insurance status likely also plays a role, because it often dictates access to and quality of surgical care. 6 , 18 Even so, lung cancer surgical RCTs, which we found to have a completion rate of only 30.9%, seem to lag far behind success rates of other surgical specialties, as illustrated by completion rates of 70.7% in head and neck cancer RCTs and 59.9% in orthopedic-focused RCTs in other ClinicalTrials.gov studies. 10 , 19 , 20 Another study that grouped surgical RCTs as a whole found a completion rate of 78.5% of the 2542 included trials, which is a stark contrast to our finding and further highlights the scope of the problem. 9 A majority of the trials we examined were open-label and single-center, falling short of the true gold standard of a blinded multicenter RCT, further supporting the need to improve on current processes.\n\nExisting literature has shown that over-optimism in timelines and expected enrollment in RCTs is an active problem and that there are techniques to balance for it. Initiating a pilot study before launching a full-scale RCT imbued with a massive amount of resources, both personnel and infrastructure, is an excellent way to gauge feasibility and temper expectations. These pilots can either be part of the larger RCT or external to it and can contribute to building a research network across institutions, which will increase actual enrollment and lend generalizability to the study cohort. We also identified enrollment and accrual as a major barrier in the evidence to practice pipeline. The 21 completed studies in our analysis reported that the number of actual enrolled patients was approximately 74% of what was anticipated. In addition, the most common reason that RCTs were discontinued was secondary to accrual issues. A cross-sectional study by Shadbolt and colleagues 9 found that of 2542 surgical RCTs performed in 2010 to 2014, only 45.9% met their prespecified enrollment target, and those that did not met their target were shy by approximately 31% of the planned study sample. This is highly concerning because power analyses done during RCT design specify a minimum number of subjects to avoid a type II error, and approximately half of trials do not meet this benchmark. One of the ways to ameliorate low RCT accrual is to include more centers and more physicians. However, surgical-focused RCTs depend on all the included hospitals and surgeons to have the same level of technical abilities and resources. Moreover, for RCTs that study various surgical modalities such as open, video-assisted, and robotic-assisted surgery, which in our search comprised 13% of all lung cancer RCTs, the surgeon learning curve is challenging to control for and can significantly skew outcomes. One solution to combat poor accrual proposed by Halpern 21 is to intervene preemptively by the use of a prospective preference assessment to gather information about participants' incentives and concerns for trial participation to refine trial design and identify unique cohort characteristics that may limit generalizability. Likewise, Kaur and colleagues 22 developed a survey tool to highlight common facilitators and barriers to recruitment in clinical trials and stratified these variables by patient-level, clinician-level, trial-level, and site-level factors. The authors recommended using this survey as a flexible framework for ongoing RCTs that are facing enrollment issues to enable real-time troubleshooting and increase the rate of trial completions. Addressing accrual challenges from different perspectives will shed further light on the main downfall of current trials: long lag time throughout the RCT process.\n\nThe literature on delays in the research to practice continuum has not been studied widely due to complexities in defining and measuring time lag. Published studies have measured lag as various permutations of time between ethical approval and trial start to publication and guideline change. 23 , 24 , 25 Fiteni and colleagues 26 evaluated 34 RCTs on operable non–small cell lung cancer and found that the majority of articles failed to report time-to-event end points, which complicates the ability to measure time lag. Our results found that the average study completion time for surgical lung cancer RCTs was 5.8 years and then 2.9 years from trial completion to publication, with only 67% of completed studies having published a manuscript available on PubMed or Google Scholar. Although a certain amount of lag is necessary to vet new interventions and ensure safety and efficacy, optimizing unnecessary delays is beneficial to individual physicians and policymakers alike, because it could lead to quicker clinical impact and improved cost-effectiveness in the public health sector. 1 Morris and colleagues 1 published an article in 2011 gathering evidence about the consensus in medicine that the average time lag from “bench to bedside” is 17 years. 18 , 27 , 28 This statistic is concerning because the original clinical question at stake may no longer be relevant by the time results are circulated and publicly available. Interventions to minimize lags can be organized by pretrial, during trial, and post-trial time periods. In the pretrial setting, regulatory processes can be streamlined to enable quicker activation to trial start. 2 In ongoing trials, rapid early accrual, which we have discussed as a current barrier, has been shown to be an independent predictor of both study completion (hazard ratio, 1.4; P = .004) and successful publication (hazard ratio, 1.09; P = .011). 29 Last, after trial completion, addressing publication bias will enable quicker dissemination. Urrútia and colleagues 30 showed that trials with positive results are significantly more likely to publish not only faster but also in a higher impact factor journal. The more objectively we can quantify time lags in research, the better we will be equipped to implement changes to close the evidence to practice gap.\n\nThe long-lasting impacts of RCTs occur not only from publication alone but also from broad and high-yield dissemination of key takeaways. 31 , 32 The ability of RCTs to change clinical practice is more nuanced in surgery compared with other specialties. In medical specialties, RCT findings can streamline the development of guidelines that inform recommendations for specific clinical interventions. This process involves stakeholders such as physicians, researchers, and patient advocates, and the guidelines are disseminated through channels such as continuing education courses, journal articles, and online resources. 33 On the other hand, in surgical specialties, the process of incorporating new evidence into clinical practice is more complex because of the increased invasiveness, risk, and severity of possible complications. In addition, studies have shown that surgeons greatly value clinical autonomy, which likely plays a role in reluctance to change practices based on the results of a single RCT. 34 , 35 Decision science studies that evaluate physician behavior have found that decontextualized knowledge does not lead to incorporation into daily practice. E1 RCTs are typically conducted in highly controlled settings that may not mirror real-world experiences and diverse patient demographics. Consequently, surgeons carry an additional weight of contextualizing RCT results through a local lens to assess if their patient population and hospital resources are appropriate for the proposed practice change. There have been several successes in the field that can serve as examples for designing future trials, including those that popularized video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery over open surgery as the mainstay of thoracic surgery. E2 , E3 In fact, this phenomenon is now repeating itself as robotic-surgery gains more traction and is becoming a major player in the treatment of all stages of lung cancer. E4 , E5 , E6 Two other examples of highly successful and impactful RCTs (JCOG0802 and CALGB 140503) have received significant international attention and bolstered the use of segmentectomy for small, early-stage non–small cell lung cancers. E7 , E8 Additionally, another key research area in lung cancer that has seen surgeon participation is the use of immunotherapy and targeted therapy in treatment of lung cancer. Although these are medical intervention trials and were not included in this analysis, results of these pharmaceutical trials are changing surgical practice. E9 , E10 Although these are only a few examples, effective use of implementation science principles will help structure the integration of academic output into practice without taking away from personalized shared decision-making between surgeons and patients. E11\n\nStudy Limitations\n\nOur study has several limitations due to the lack of granularity and consistency in conducting retrospective database studies. This study was not meant to be an overarching review on all lung cancer RCTs, but a hypothesis-driven query to gauge completion and publication rates of surgical-focused RCTs in lung cancer historically up until April 2023. An important caveat to note is that there are many landmark trials regarding neoadjuvant and adjuvant therapy in lung cancer management that are not included in our analysis. Additionally, multiple platforms exist to register RCTs, and even for RCTs registered in clincialtrials.gov , the trials may contain incomplete information or record information in a different format leading to missing data. E12 Several key trials, such as JCOG 0802/WJOG4607L, were not included in this analysis because RCTs from Japan use different registration databases that capture data fields dissimilarly and may not provide researchers uniform access for analysis. The lack of a standardized, international repository of RCTs is problematic and should prompt efforts to prioritize better data organization and compilation. This study aimed to perform a pulse check on the status of surgical lung cancer RCTs with the hopes of identifying areas of quality improvement for future trials. Our objective was not to summarize the content of individual RCTs and should not be used as a comprehensive resource, but rather as a tool that demonstrates the broad landscape of trends that have occurred in lung cancer surgical research stratified by time period and region of the world. Although our current study might not capture all international RCTs on this topic, it is, to our knowledge, the only one that synthesizes data from RCTs in the surgical lung cancer sphere to examine current effectiveness in translational research.\n\nConclusions\n\nGiven the immense investment in resources that RCTs require, these findings suggest the need for future RCT proposals to be scrutinized for the chances of successful completion. Those RCTs that are completed are most often single center and nonblinded, falling short of the true gold standard of a multicenter, single-blind trial. This study also highlights that not all RCTs have equal impact potential, and that single-facility studies on minor surgical differences could lead to misappropriation of limited resources and ultimately could be a detriment toward advancing lung cancer care. Alternatively, other types of evidence generation should be sought, such as real-world evidence and pragmatic prospective observational studies. With the amount of observational data constantly generated in the surgical oncology world, we may already have a sufficient amount of evidence on certain lung cancer topics, even without RCTs, that shows large effects relative to the background noise. E13 E14 In addition to challenging the impact of surgical RCTs, we must also be more willing to use large observational data when honing practice guidelines and perhaps deemphasize the “level of evidence” paradigm that places so much weight on RCT-generated data. Future study is needed to understand the various contributing factors to RCT success or failure, which will hopefully increase high-yield evidence generation that can be translated to improved clinical guidelines.\n\nConflict of Interest Statement\n\nY.L. is a full-time employee at Intuitive Surgical.
