  "full_text": "Introduction\n\nTibial plateau fractures (TPFs) are severe intra‐articular injuries with multiple symptoms, primarily caused by overloading of the tibial plateau, such as impingement and varus or valgus components [ 1 , 2 , 3 ]. Overall, TPFs account for 1% of all fractures and 8% of fractures in the elderly [ 4 , 5 ], while depressed tibial plateau fractures make up a significant portion, representing 50.2% of all TPFs [ 6 , 7 ]. The treatment objectives include anatomical reduction of the articular surfaces, correct positioning of the lower extremity, stable immobilization, and reduction of the risk of posttraumatic osteoarthritis [ 8 , 9 , 10 ].\n\nHowever, complex fractures of the tibial plateau pose challenges even for experienced surgeons [ 11 ], often involving extensive soft tissue injury. Achieving anatomical reduction and rigid fixation typically requires the use of three or more plates for internal fixation, which would increase soft tissue agitation and potentially lead to severe postoperative complications, such as wound healing problems, infections, and even amputations [ 12 , 13 , 14 ]. Postoperative complications would significantly intensify the economic burden [ 15 ]. What's more, the involvement of the posterolateral portion of the joint is more severe than the more common anterolateral fractures, as surgical exposure of this portion of the tibial plateau is difficult and may result in long‐term knee instability [ 16 , 17 ]. Another significant challenge in the surgical treatment of posterior TPFs is the lack of suitable internal plate fixation systems. Most of all, due to the significant physiological differences and unique geometries of TPFs, plate fit has become a common problem [ 18 ]. According to Jacob R et al. [ 19 ], pre‐bending of plates would significantly alter strain distribution and can affect strength.\n\nFabricating custom implants can be tailored to the bone anatomy, resulting in a more stable fixation structure and better clinical outcomes. This is particularly beneficial for patients with extreme anatomic variations (beyond the normal implantation area), severe deformities or injuries, or complex anatomical areas [ 20 ]. Similar technologies have been applied in other fields. For example, Junya Imatani et al. used custom AO small T plates and a transcondylar screw to treat transcondylar fractures of the distal humerus in the elderly [ 21 ], and 17 patients all achieved well union with a mean of 30 months. Wang et al. treated complex pelvic fractures with a customized Ti6Al4V bone plate [ 22 ] to address bone plate shaping and long operation time challenges, and Li et al. utilized a custom‐made anchor‐like plate combined with cerclage in the treatment of inferior pole patellar fractures; 21 cases achieved good union ranging from 8 to 12 weeks [ 23 ]. However, there are limitations to the routine use of customized implants, including production lead time and cost. The justification for using these custom implants and their relative performance compared with standard implants still needs further investigation, as current evidence is insufficient [ 20 ].\n\nThis study aimed to explore the effectiveness of customized internal fixation in the treatment of TPFs, optimize the manufacturing process and techniques of customized internal fixation devices, and validate the mechanical effects of customized implants through finite element analysis.\n\nMethods\n\nInclusion and Exclusion Criteria for Surgery\n\nThe inclusion criteria were as follows: (1) Patients aged 18–80 years with fractures of TPFs, regardless of gender; (2) Patients requiring surgical open reduction with internal fixation (ORIF) and treated with customized implants; (3) No obvious contraindications; (4) Patients agreed to follow up, and the clinic information is completed.\n\nThe exclusion criteria were as follows: (1) Severe osteoarthritis, rheumatism, rheumatoid arthritis, pathological fracture, and open fracture; (2) Severe systemic diseases that would prevent tolerance of anesthesia or surgery; (3) Active infection at the local site or systemic infection; (4) Allergy to the material used for implants; (5) Cases with incomplete clinical documentation or unsuccessful follow‐up attempts; (6) Individuals who withheld consent for medical data utilization.\n\nPatients\n\nFourteen patients who were admitted to our hospital between May 1, 2023, and June 1, 2023, met the inclusion/exclusion criteria for surgery and agreed to undergo customized implant operations. Among the patients, three had femoral fractures and one lacked necessary imaging, resulting in a final inclusion of 10 patients with TPFs (Figure 1 ). The basic information about these 10 patients is presented in Table 1 , including six females and four males. The age range of patients was 26–73 years, with an average of 48.4 years. Seven patients had suffered traffic accidents, while three patients had fall injuries. X‐ray and CT scans were used to diagnose and determine the specific classification of the fractures. The procedure was approved by the Ethics Committee of the ethical institution (2022KY108‐KS001) and Municipal Medical Products Administration, and all methods were carried out by relevant regulations. Moreover, we have obtained informed consent from all subjects and/or their legal guardian, the information of operation and follow‐up was recorded, such as operative time, blood loss, Lysholm score, knee ROM °, and EQ‐5D‐3L score to evaluate the effectiveness of the customized implants.\n\nDesign and Manufacture of Customized Implants\n\nEach patient's tibial plateau fracture was obtained using a 64‐slice CT scanner in our institution. The extent of the fracture determined whether a CT scan of the knee or the entire lower leg was performed. The scan results were delivered in the DICOM format and imported into Mimics Medical (21.0, Materialise, Belgium) software to reconstruct the 3D fracture model and pre‐reduction. Based on the surface features and shapes of the bones, the fractured fragments were reduced along the fracture line through rotation and transformation on the computer. In addition, we calculated the outline of the fragments and the volume of the intraosseous void on the tibial plateau using a method we developed previously [ 10 ]. We then used Unigraphics NX (12.0, Siemens PLM, USA) software to design implants, meticulously optimizing the shape of the internal fixation based on the specific bone morphology of each patient, including the curvature of the plate, the direction of the screw space, the size of the pads, and other crucial factors to ensure a perfect fit and enhance the overall treatment outcome. The implants were fabricated through machining (DMU 50, DMG MORI SEIKI, Germany) with forged titanium alloy or 3D printing, and underwent post‐processing steps such as grinding and anodizing (Figure 2 ).\n\nSurgical Technique\n\nThe patients in this study underwent treatment using either a general or spinal anesthetic, along with ORIF techniques performed by a surgical team. The patients were positioned supine or prone on a table that allowed X‐rays to pass through, with a tourniquet placed on the lower limb to restrict blood flow during the procedure. The specific surgical approach used was determined based on the classification of the fracture. For Schatzker type II and III fractures, a lateral approach was employed, while a medial approach was preferred for Schatzker type IV fractures. In the case of Schatzker type V and VI fractures, dual incisions were made. After achieving a satisfactory reduction in all cases, the Kirschner wires were temporarily fixed. Intraoperative fluoroscopic examination was then conducted, followed by internal fixation with plates. All surgical operations were performed by a consistent lead surgeon who also served as the corresponding author of the study.\n\nFinite Element Analysis\n\nThe three‐dimensional model of the lower extremities was created using DICOM data from a healthy 65‐year‐old female (weight: 75 kg) obtained from a 64‐slice CT scanner, who was fully informed. Mimics was used to derive the model, and Geomagic Wrap (version 2017, 3D Systems, USA) was employed to refine and process the initial model. Subsequently, the Unigraphic NX software (version 10.0, Siemens PLM software, USA) was used to generate geometric 3D models of implants and two separate fragments in the medial tibial plateau, simulating a Schatzker IV fracture based on a specific case (Case 10). Two fixation models were created: MDPs (LCP Medial Proximal Tibial Plate and Posterior Medial Proximal Tibia Plate) with 13 screws and MCP (γ type plate) with 10 screws. Both fracture fragments were effectively repositioned and secured using screws (Figure 3 ).\n\nThe profiles of the models were imported into Hypermesh (version 2019; Altair; USA) for meshing and assignment of material properties, following the recommended method [ 24 ]. A series of simulations was conducted, gradually increasing the level of relevance until the maximum displacement values exhibited no more than 5% variation. The resulting meshes consisted of tetrahedral elements with an average size of 1.0 mm, meeting the convergence criteria. The number of nodes and elements for each component unit is presented in Table 2 .\n\nThe assembled 3D models were imported into ANSYS (version 19.0, USA) to generate finite element models. All plates and screws were made of titanium alloy (Ti‐6AL‐4V), and the modulus of elasticity and Poisson's ratio of the bone and implants are shown in Table 3 . Moreover, the surface between the fragments and between the tibia and fragments was defined as frictional contact with a friction coefficient of 0.2. The friction coefficient for bone and internal fixation interactions was 0.332 [ 25 ].\n\nTo simulate a load of a single leg stance during gait, which was three times body weight according to Taylor et al. [ 26 ], we applied a total force of 2250 N. This force was divided into two loads: 832.5 N at 403 mm [ 2 ] of the lateral tibial plateau and 1417.5 N at 374 mm [ 2 ] of the medial tibial plateau surface [ 27 , 28 ] as point A and B in Figure 4 . The lower surface of the tibia model was constrained to have zero displacement in all degrees of freedom, represented as point C in Figure 4 . The Von Mises Stress (VMS, MPa) distribution across both implant components and the tibial plateau was quantified to assess load‐bearing characteristics of the fixation constructs. Displacement parameters (mm), including global tibial plateau migration and three‐dimensional displacement vectors of fracture fragments, were systematically measured.\n\nStatistical Analysis\n\nPreoperative and postoperative parameters for all patients were systematically documented and analyzed through descriptive statistics, with continuous variables expressed as mean ± standard deviation. Stress and displacement distributions derived from finite element analyses were quantified using central tendency measures (mean values) and extremum thresholds (peak magnitudes).\n\nResults\n\nDesign of Implants\n\nThe design of four types of plates that are commonly used is shown in Figure 4 . In cases where there is damage to both the anterior and posterior joint surfaces of the lateral tibial plateau, the semi‐circumferential plate (Figure 5A ) provides fixation in the horizontal and posterior regions of the fibular head, eliminating the need for multiple plates. The medial side γ‐type plate (Figure 5B ) serves the dual purpose of providing support and acting as “anchor points” for reduction. When the center point of the plate aligns with the tibia, it indicates good reduction, while an incomplete fit suggests potential malalignment. The pistol‐type (Figure 5C ) and wing‐type plates (Figure 5D ) have excellent morphology and fit, addressing the lack of suitable implants for posterior tibial plateau fractures. The former is primarily applied to unilateral posterior tibial plateau fractures, while the latter is used for bilateral cases.\n\nPreoperative imaging, preoperative reduction, and implant planning are shown in Figure 6 . All five cases of Schatzker VI and 1 case of Schatzker V underwent double plate surgery. After a thorough analysis of the fracture characteristics of Case 3, which was an old fracture with unsatisfactory recovery, we recommended using a dedicated medial plate for treatment. Similarly, for Cases 8, 9, and 10, we utilized distinct posterior plates for their respective treatments. Following our previous method [ 10 ], we calculated and extracted the size of the defect and designed a new plate and pad for the treatment of Case 5, which involved a posterolateral tibial plateau fracture and collapse. All implants for each patient were completed within 3–4 days, 1 week tops.\n\nCases Analysis\n\nIn all cases, the internal fixation systems were positioned precisely as planned preoperatively. The plates fit extremely well without the need for further bending or reshaping. Intraoperative images and postoperative X‐rays of some cases are shown in Figure 7 .\n\nIn Case 3, the patient presented with an old tibial plateau fracture, non‐union, collapse, and varus deformity. Angle adjustment of osteotomy correction was reserved during plate design. After reduction and recalibration, osteotomy correction and iliac bone grafting were performed. In Cases 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 9, large defects were observed after the reduction of the collapsed bone fragments. These defects were filled with cage, autologous, or allogeneic bone.\n\nIn Case 8, the patient was positioned in a prone position and a posterior lateral approach (Carlson incision) was used due to the relatively small fracture area. This was done to minimize soft tissue irritation and reduce the volume of the steel plate around the knee joint. A posterior lateral pistol‐type mini plate was used for fixation, resulting in excellent overall internal fixation results. Similarly, Case 10 also employed this plate fixation on the posterior lateral side. In Case 9, who was obese and had accompanying knee dislocation, a posterior medial incision was utilized. Due to the large fracture fragment of the posterior medial tibial plateau that had accumulated on the lateral plateau, a more extensive wing‐type plate design was employed.\n\nAfter more than a year of follow‐up, all cases achieved successful recovery with no notable postoperative complications. Customized fixation approach significantly reduced the duration of the procedure. Furthermore, the knee function scores and overall quality of life improved to satisfying levels postoperatively. Notably, patients with types V and VI displayed particularly favorable restoration of limb function. Among these, Cases 1, 3, and 10 have already returned to our facility to have their internal fixations removed (Table 4 ). Follow‐up analysis showed the follow‐up time as 18 ± 0.82 months, operative times of 1.37 ± 0.58 h, intraoperative blood loss of 260 ± 179.20 mL, and favorable functional outcomes: Lysholm score 88.6 ± 4.93, knee ROM 103.5° ± 11.56°, and EQ‐5D‐3L score 0.87 ± 0.47. The functional outcome is considered favorable, given that injuries involving IV, V, and VI types of fractures were observed in 8 cases.\n\nFE Results\n\nThe stress of MCP was slightly higher than that of MDPs, with a peak VMS at the most distal screw hole on plates. The stress of MCP (260.98 MPa) was 1.5 times higher than that of MDPs (170.79 MPa) (Figure 8 ). A similar pattern was observed in the stress distribution in the proximal tibia (Figure 9 ), with the peak VMS occurring at the screw holes. The stress in the bone at the last distal screw was 46.755 and 64.966 MPa. Additionally, when viewed from the side, the stress in separated fragment 1 was greater than that in separated fragment 2.\n\nThe deformation nephogram of the proximal tibia (Figure 10 ) revealed that the displacement of the MCP was relatively uniform, mainly concentrated in separated fragments, as the point of force applied. On the other hand, the displacement of the MDPs was more concentrated on the surface of the medial tibial plateau, with less overall displacement observed in other areas. However, it is noteworthy that the maximum displacement of the MDPs (0.61878 mm) was 2.4 times higher than that of the MCP (0.26124 mm).\n\nIn general, the two internal fixation methods did not alter the motion trend of the two separated fragments when subjected to a loading condition (Figures 11 and 12 ). The MDPs provided more substantial support to separated fragments 1 and 2 in the X ‐axis and Z ‐axis, including the average and maximum stresses. However, the mechanical effect in the Y ‐axis was not as practical as the MCP. Additionally, the stress distribution and range in the directional deformation nephogram differed between the two fixation systems, possibly due to differences in screw placement. It was observed that separated fragment 1 tended to separate from the tibial shaft, as it displaced in the opposite direction in the X ‐axis.\n\nDiscussion\n\nThough this study, we prove that it is effective for new customized internal fixation in the treatment of TPFs, and improve the manufacturing process and technology of customized internal fixation devices, which introduces an innovative technique for the internal fixation of complex TPFs, thereby advancing the surgical management of such challenging injuries.\n\nFavorable Outcomes of Custom Implants Fixation\n\nCustom implants have the potential to prevent problems caused by commercially manufactured orthopedic implants. Maini et al. performed a prospective randomized controlled study, enrolled 21 patients with acetabulum fracture, and they found that reduced blood loss and surgical time, and better postoperative reduction were observed in the patient‐specific pre‐contoured plate with 3D model group [ 29 ]. Belien et al. developed a preoperative patient‐customized plate to treat symptomatic os acromiale and acromial fracture; all 5 cases of fracture or non‐union healed, and they also found that the duration of surgery was reduced because of the preparation of the overall operation in advance and better communication with the patient and surgical team about the planned operation with a 3D model [ 30 ]. Although the technique of customized implants was significant, the routine use of customized implants is currently limited due to potential delays in surgery and prolonged immobility, which is associated with numerous complications [ 31 ]. In a study by Alex Quok An et al. [ 32 ], the average time from pre‐operative CT scan to completion of surgery was approximately 25 h and 2 min, with a maximum of 29 h and 26 mins. They were able to produce customized plates within 72 hs by optimizing the process. Similarly, while ensuring the quality of customized implants, it is possible to manufacture even two implants within 3–4 days (up to 1 week) through machining or 3D printing, which is acceptable. Since TPFs often involve severe soft tissue injury [ 33 ], surgery is frequently delayed to allow for soft tissue recovery, and operative times in the literature vary from 3 days to 1 week in different institutions [ 34 , 35 ].\n\nOptimizing Fracture‐Specific Fixation Through Additive/Subtractive Design Innovation\n\nCustom implants have the potential to maximize the advantages of additive and subtractive manufacturing to improve the overall efficacy of orthopedic surgery. One of the challenges in trauma surgery is the wide variation in fracture patterns and underlying skeletal anatomy—fractures occur in countless ways, making it difficult to categorize them for treatment decisions [ 36 , 37 ]. Semi‐circumferential and γ‐type plates with optimal fit characteristics for particular patients effectively solve this problem by increasing the fixation area while reducing soft tissue dissection, and the flexible angle variability of the locking screws in customized implant systems will ensure adequate control of fragments. Surprisingly, these two types of plates have shown promise in aiding reduction. When properly fitted, they have indicated successful reduction and restoration of the force line, thereby reducing the reliance on intraoperative fluoroscopy and improving surgical efficiency. Furthermore, there are currently no implants specifically designed for treating posterolateral TPFs [ 38 ]. In a study by Sassoon et al. [ 39 ], it was found that using 6 different plates from 5 major manufacturers, 42% of the total anteroposterior depth of the lateral plateau lacked support behind the most posterior raft screw, with an average of 40% (range: 25%–58%) joint surface area losing support. The pistol‐type and wing‐type plates were designed for posterolateral and bilateral posterior TPFs, offering smaller incisions, less tissue dissection, and no involvement of any vital neurovascular structures. Additionally, the additive and subtractive technique allows for adjustment of the curvature, radian, size, length, and thickness of internal fixation. This customization could effectively enhance postoperative recovery for patients.\n\nExcellent Mechanical Effects of γ‐Shaped Plate\n\nCustom implants of γ‐shaped plate have shown excellent mechanical effects that could enhance the stability of tibial plateau fracture fixation. In a study conducted by Alex Quok An Teo et al., they compared the biomechanical strength of standard and customized 3D‐printed proximal tibial locking plates for Schatzker II TPF cadaveric fixation constructs [ 20 ]. They observed that after 10,000 cycles with loading up to three times body weight, there was no significant difference in the degree of fracture fragment displacement between the two structures. The 3D‐printed plates group exhibited higher overall longitudinal construct stiffness and load to failure. Our finite element analysis also demonstrated that the γ‐type plate had comparable strength to the general plate systems and provided a stronger ability to resist the separation of fracture fragments due to its integrated design. Furthermore, our findings suggest that customized implants made from forged titanium alloy may have advantages over 3D‐printed products in terms of longevity and fatigue resistance.\n\nEnhance Preoperative Planning, Surgical Precision, and Patient Communication\n\nIn addition, the use of 3D‐printed models could aid in better understanding the specific circumstances and classification of fractures as well as identifying potential issues that might arise during surgery [ 40 , 41 ]. Wu et al. [ 13 ] discovered that this method enables clinicians to simulate the reduction and stabilization process before surgery and refer to the model during the procedure. This allows for more precise treatment of the fractured area, avoids unnecessary surgical trauma, shortens surgical time, and minimizes the risk of complications. Based on our study, 3D‐printed fracture models supported the entire surgical process and facilitated communication between doctors and patients.\n\nStrengths and Limitations\n\nOur study presented novel implants with custom technology for the fixation of TPFs particularly demonstrating favorable efficacy in managing complex type V and VI TPFs. We propose that this patient‐specific fixation strategy is recommended for application in the treatment of complex extremity fractures, like periprosthetic fractures or cases where conventional instrumentation proves inadequate. However, our study has certain limitations, including a small sample size and the absence of a control group. Although all surgeries were performed by the same specialized orthopedic surgeon, it is important to note that this novel technology still requires further learning and progress in surgical technology. Furthermore, we acknowledge the need for future biomechanical studies encompassing all types of plates, which we plan to address in future research. Furthermore, future investigations will also focus on extending the application of customized orthopedic devices to additional anatomical sites and conducting prospective cohort studies to systematically evaluate clinical outcomes and therapeutic efficacy.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn this study, our objective was to evaluate the effectiveness of customized internal fixation in treating tibial plateau fractures. Customized internal fixation systems offer solutions to challenges, such as complex fractures requiring more significant amounts of plating or the lack of suitable internal fixation systems for posterior plateau fractures. By utilizing additive and subtractive manufacturing techniques, we can expand the range of internal fixation options while minimizing soft tissue irritation. Importantly, finite element analysis has demonstrated that the strength of customized internal fixation systems of γ‐shaped plate was comparable to that of conventional implants. Additionally, the entire process, from data acquisition to implant fabrication, can be completed within a clinically acceptable timeframe of 3–4 days (at most 1 week). This innovative approach provides a new avenue for managing tibial plateau fractures and even complex limb fractures.\n\nAuthor Contributions\n\nWei Zhang and Yu Jiang conceived and designed the experiments; Meng Li and Mengmeng Hu performed the experiments and wrote the article; Xiaomeng Ren, Yi Gao, and Longbo Du analyzed the data.\n\nConflicts of Interest\n\nThe authors declare no conflicts of interest.",
