  "title": "Corticosteroid Effects on Upper Esophageal Sphincter Function in Anterior Cervical Discectomy and Fusion",
  "abstract": "Background:: The aim of our study was to explore the effect of local corticosteroids on dysphagia in patients undergoing anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF). To address a gap in the limited research on this topic, we utilized high-resolution impedance manometry (HRIM) and the Eating Assessment Tool-10 (EAT-10) questionnaire to assess the effects on key swallowing muscles, including the upper esophageal sphincter (UES).\n\nMethods:: We randomly assigned patients undergoing ACDF to either the corticosteroid group or the saline solution group. Patients received 10 mg of local triamcinolone or saline solution prevertebrally at the cervical spine level before wound closure. Swallowing function preoperatively and at 1 month postoperatively were compared between the groups with use of HRIM parameters (e.g., UES relaxation, UES opening extent, intrabolus pressure, and pharyngeal contraction) and EAT-10 scores. Patients were also followed for postoperative complications and mortality within 12 months after surgery.\n\nResults:: Thirty patients completed the study. The median age was 55 years in the corticosteroid group and 57 years in the saline group, and each group had 8 female patients. All participants were Taiwanese. We found no significant difference in median preoperative UES relaxation pressure between the corticosteroid and saline solution groups (33.8 and 31.3 mm Hg, respectively; p = 0.54). Postoperatively, the corticosteroid group had significantly lower median UES relaxation pressure than the saline solution group (24.5 versus 33.6 mm Hg; p = 0.01). Before and after surgery, all other HRIM parameters and EAT-10 scores were similar between the groups, with the corticosteroid group demonstrating median pre- and postoperative EAT-10 scores of 0 and 4, respectively, and the saline solution group demonstrating scores of 2 and 3, respectively. There were no adverse events.\n\nConclusions:: The findings suggest that local corticosteroids may reduce UES relaxation pressure at 1 month after ACDF, potentially enhancing UES opening. Further research is required to verify our findings.\n\nLevel of Evidence:: Therapeutic Level I . See Instructions for Authors for a complete description of levels of evidence.",

The patients and analyst were blinded to the allocation process; additionally, the treating physician was blinded to patient allocation during the assessment of swallowing. The study was conducted in accordance with the ethical standards embodied in the 1964 Declaration of Helsinki, approved by our institutional review board (202002052MIND), and registered at ClinicalTrials.gov ( NCT04717713 ). Written informed consent was obtained from all patients.\n\nAll patients 20 to 80 years old who underwent ACDF were considered for enrollment by the clinical trial manager (Fig. 1 ). Patients were excluded from the study if they underwent revision procedures; were operated on via anterior and posterior approaches; had trauma, infection, tumor, or any other medical contraindications to local corticosteroid administration; or had coagulopathy.\n\nSurgical Technique\n\nAll ACDF procedures were performed on the right side of the neck. The standard Smith-Robinson approach was utilized to access the anterior cervical spine. We first made a 4-cm horizontal linear skin incision extending from the midline to the anterior border of the right sternocleidomastoid muscle. We then dissected along the anterior border of the platysma muscle and gently retracted the infrahyoid muscle and trachea medially. We did not transect or sacrifice any muscle during the approach to the prevertebral space of the cervical spine. The medial aspect of the longus colli muscle was dissected off the vertebral bodies bilaterally, and Koros self-retaining retractors (Koros USA) were utilized to hold the tissues in place. We performed the anulotomy, discectomy, and posterior osteophyte removal with use of a high-speed hand drill, curet, and Kerrison rongeurs. The posterior longitudinal ligament was then resected in all cases.\n\nWe used a PEEK (polyetheretherketone) interbody cage with an artificial bone graft. Either local triamcinolone (10 mg/1 mL) or the equivalent volume of saline solution was sprayed into the prevertebral space before wound closure. No other method was utilized, nor was any other space-occupying material inserted into the prevertebral space. Intravenous corticosteroids were not administered during the preoperative or perioperative periods. A surgical drain was inserted anterior to the fusion site during surgery. Patients were discharged on the first or second postoperative day.\n\nPatient Recruitment Process\n\nParticipants were randomly assigned to the local corticosteroid or saline solution groups after providing their informed consent. A computer spreadsheet was utilized for the randomization process. The operating room nurse, who was informed of the group allocations, prepared 10 mg of triamcinolone or the equivalent volume of saline solution accordingly. This process was performed discreetly, keeping the anesthesiologist, trial manager, and patients unaware of the treatment that was administered. Although the surgeon could identify the substance administered on the basis of its color, this did not affect the procedure or delivery of care because the injections occurred during wound closure. Patients underwent HRIM assessment preoperatively and at 1 month postoperatively under the supervision of the clinical trial manager, who was blinded to treatment allocation. All patients were followed for the occurrence of postoperative complications, including any related complications and mortality, within 12 months after surgery in order to ensure comprehensive postoperative care and data collection.\n\nEquipment for HRIM\n\nWe performed the HRIM with use of a 10-Fr outer diameter solid-state assembly with 36 circumferential pressure sensors spaced at 1-cm intervals and 12 impedance segments spaced at 2-cm intervals (Medical Measurement Systems). Patients fasted for at least 6 hours before being intubated and undergoing the HRIM. During the HRIM, the catheter was strategically positioned to span the entire pharyngoesophageal segment, ensuring precise and comprehensive data collection (Fig. 2 ). Patients sat upright while the Solar GI system (Medical Measurement Systems) recorded pressure and impedance at 20 Hz.\n\nHRIM Protocol\n\nAfter the HRIM catheter was inserted through the pharyngoesophageal segment (Fig. 2 ), 5 mL of normal saline solution bolus was administered at 20-second intervals with use of a syringe. Each patient underwent 10 swallowing tests in the neutral head position.\n\nManometry Data Analysis\n\nThe manometry data were analyzed as described in our previous study 3 . The data analysis was performed with use of MATLAB (The MathWorks). We compared 11 key HRIM metrics between the groups: (1) UES 0.25-s integrated relaxation pressure (IRP; range, −4 to 15 mm Hg), (2) UES basal pressure, (3) UES post-deglutitive peak pressure (UES PeakP), (4) UES open time, (5) UES maximum admittance (UES Adm), (6) the velopharynx-to-tongue-base contractile index (VTI), (7) hypopharyngeal mean peak pressure (hypopharyngeal PeakP), (8) hypopharyngeal intrabolus pressure 1 cm above the UES (IBP), (9) hypopharyngeal distension contraction latency (DCL), (10) hypopharyngeal bolus presence time (BPT), and (11) the swallow risk index (SRI), calculated with use of the following formula: SRI = (IBP × BPT)/([DCL + 1] × hypopharyngeal PeakP) × 100 3 , 6 . These parameters were essential for understanding the swallowing mechanics and comparing the groups with respect to their physiological responses.\n\nRadiographic Monitoring\n\nWe utilized lateral radiography to perform the radiographic measurements. Patients were scheduled to undergo radiography preoperatively, on postoperative day 1, and at postoperative months 1, 3, and 12. We utilized this lateral radiography to capture measurements of the anterior and posterior diameters of the anterior soft tissue at the C3 and C6 levels in order to assess prevertebral soft-tissue swelling 16 . Using a picture archiving and communication system (EBM Technologies), we determined the horizontal distance from the midsection of the anterior cortex of each vertebral body to the point where the airway shadow was visible. This procedure was performed by 2 technicians who were unaware of the research protocol and grouping. In addition, we utilized the Cobb angle (between the end plates of C2 and C7) to assess regional alignment. We did not use computed tomography for fusion evaluation, but we did measure and compare segmental height reduction between the groups. When the height reduction exceeded 3 mm, it was classified as subsidence 17 . Plate prominence was also measured by 2 technicians 18 .\n\nSample Size Calculation\n\nWe hypothesized that the corticosteroid group would have a lower IRP than the saline solution group, with expected 1-month postoperative mean IRP values (and standard deviations) of 20 ± 9 and 30 ± 8 mm Hg, respectively. To achieve a statistical power of >0.8 with an alpha of 0.05 and a 1:1 group ratio, we needed 13 patients per group. Factoring in a 10% dropout rate, we recruited 15 patients per group, for a total of 30 patients.\n\nStatistical Analysis\n\nThe data for the local corticosteroid and saline solution groups were compared with use of an appropriate method for the type of variable. Categorical variables are presented as counts and percentages and were analyzed with use of the Pearson chi-square or Fisher exact test. Continuous variables are presented as medians and interquartile ranges (IQRs) and were analyzed with use of the Mann-Whitney U test. Significance was set at p < 0.05.\n\nResults\n\nPatient Characteristics\n\nA total of 37 patients were assessed for eligibility; however, 2 patients were excluded because they did not meet the inclusion criteria and 5 declined to participate (Fig. 1 ). Thus, a total of 30 participants were enrolled. Preoperatively, the patients had no abnormalities of the jaw, tongue, soft palate, pharynx, or esophagus; they had an intact oral mucosa and the ability to self-feed without needing specially minced soft foods. None of the patients had a medical history of stroke, other neurological diseases, or hip fracture. The patients were randomly assigned to either the corticosteroid group or the saline solution (control) group (Fig. 1 ). The number of surgical levels was similar between the corticosteroid and saline solution groups (p = 0.90), with both groups having a median value of 2 (IQR: 1, 3). The baseline demographic characteristics of the patients were similar between the groups (Table I). The median age of the corticosteroid group was 55 years, whereas the median age of the saline group was 57 years. There were 8 female patients in each group. All participants were Taiwanese, as identified by the clinical trial manager from the electronic health records.\n\nSurgical Outcomes\n\nThe median duration of hospitalization in both groups was 3 days (Table I). No significant differences in total surgical duration or estimated blood loss were found between the groups (Table I). All drains were removed on postoperative day 1. There were no occurrences of readmission, reoperation, postoperative intravenous corticosteroid administration, or morphine use. There were no wound-related complications such as infections, delayed healing, hematomas, or seromas; implant loosening; or mortality during the 12-month follow-up period postoperatively.\n\nHRIM Outcomes\n\nPreoperatively, no differences in UES parameters were found between the groups (Table II). However, at 1 month postoperatively, the median UES IRP in the corticosteroid group (24.5 mm Hg) was notably reduced compared with the preoperative value and was significantly lower than that in the saline solution group (33.6 mm Hg; p = 0.01; Table III). There were no significant differences in the other UES-related metrics between the groups.\n\nNo intergroup differences were observed in the VTI, hypopharyngeal parameters (including the hypopharyngeal PeakP, DCL, and BPT), or SRI at any time point (Tables II and III).\n\nRadiographic Outcomes\n\nThe diameter of the prevertebral soft tissue at C3 and that at C6 were significantly smaller in the corticosteroid group than in the saline solution group at 1 and 3 months postoperatively (see Appendix I). The values of prevertebral soft-tissue swelling did not significantly differ between the groups at the other time points. Correlations between prevertebral soft-tissue swelling and UES IRP and between prevertebral soft-tissue swelling and the EAT-10 are shown in Appendix II. Correlations between plate prominence and UES IRP and between plate prominence and the EAT-10 are shown in Appendix III. The correlation values shown in Appendices II and III were not significant.\n\nThere were no significant differences between the groups with respect to regional sagittal alignment measurement preoperatively and at 1 day and 1, 3, and 12 months postoperatively (see Appendix I). Similarly, no significant differences in the subsidence rates at 1, 3, and 12 months postoperatively were found between the groups. No patients had ankylosing spondylitis or diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis affecting anterior osteophyte formation 19 .\n\nEAT-10 Scores\n\nPreoperative and 1-month postoperative EAT-10 scores did not significantly differ between the groups (Table IV).\n\nDiscussion\n\nAt 30 days after ACDF, the patients who received local corticosteroids had significantly lower IRP values in the UES than those who received normal saline solution. However, all other postoperative UES-related parameters, as well as the VTI, hypopharynx-related parameters, SRI, and EAT-10 scores, did not significantly differ between the 2 groups.\n\nOur study revealed that the local administration of corticosteroids may be effective in reducing IRP in the UES. Several factors may contribute to such a reduction. For example, reducing local edema and inhibiting the synthesis of intercellular collagen and proteoglycan may reduce the local inflammatory response 20 . Another potential factor is the local administration of corticosteroids to the cricopharyngeal muscle. This muscle plays a crucial role in the high-pressure zone of the UES, so reducing the inflammation of that muscle may also reduce the pressure profile within the UES 7 .\n\nOur findings align with previous meta-analyses demonstrating that local or intravenous perioperative steroid administration reduced dysphagia after ACDF 8 , 21 , 22 . However, relying on questionnaires, as was done in the aforementioned studies, may underestimate dysphagia-related dysmotility. The present study enhances understanding by precisely evaluating the effect of corticosteroids on UES dysmotility following ACDF. Preoperatively, the UES IRP of each group exceeded the normal range of <15 mm Hg 6 , suggesting that patients with cervical disorders may have elevated UES IRP 3 . However, preoperative UES IRP data for these conditions are scarce. In our previous study 3 , patients undergoing ACDF without local corticosteroid administration demonstrated no significant changes in UES IRP from the preoperative time point to postoperative day 7. Similarly, the control group in the present study showed no significant changes in UES IRP from the preoperative time point to 1 month postoperatively (see Appendix IV). Because of the discomfort associated with HRIM tests, patients were rarely willing to undergo multiple tests. To adjust for this, we changed our protocol to assess swallowing function 1 month after surgery. Taking the findings of the 2 studies together, our results indicate that, without local corticosteroid administration, there was no significant change in UES IRP from before the surgery to 7 days or 1 month postoperatively.\n\nSome disparity was observed in the postoperative median UES basal pressure between the corticosteroid and saline solution groups, but it did not reach significance. The reasons for this finding may be the wide range of UES basal pressure that is considered normal (29 to 125 mm Hg) 6 , 23 and random errors owing to the small sample size. We further examined whether the change in UES basal pressure from the preoperative to postoperative time points differed between the groups, but the difference was not significant (see Appendix V).\n\nWe found no significant differences in preoperative or 1-month postoperative EAT-10 scores between the 2 groups. Subjective questionnaires may not fully represent changes in swallowing function 24 . We therefore propose that HRIM may be more promising than the EAT-10 for assessing postoperative changes following ACDF, particularly for detecting substantial alterations in UES function.\n\nExcessive blood loss and the placement of an anterior plate have been shown to be risk factors for dysphagia 25 , 26 . However, no significant intergroup differences were found for these variables in the present study, probably because of the small sample size. We did not explore the risk factors of omohyoid muscle destruction and tracheal intubation duration 27 - 29 because all of our patients had intact omohyoid muscles as well as a short duration of tracheal intubation as a result of the short duration of the surgery.\n\nOf the 30 patients in this study, 13 had anterior plate placements. In patients undergoing single-level ACDF with a stand-alone cage, plates were seldom utilized because of the acceptable fusion rate. In instances of multilevel ACDF, plating was an option. The screw and plate systems were covered by our national insurance, and the decision to use plating was determined through shared decision-making.\n\nThe strength of this study is that it is, to our knowledge, the first randomized controlled trial to utilize HRIM, which assesses aspiration risk, to investigate the effect of local corticosteroid application on UES function following ACDF. HRIM may outperform videofluoroscopy, the utility of which is often hindered by poor UES visibility due to shoulder shadowing. Nevertheless, our study does have some limitations. First, the follow-up period was only 1 month. To enhance our understanding of long-term changes in the pressure-flow parameters of patients following surgery, future studies could consider extending the follow-up duration to 6 months or even 1 year. Second, our patients were enrolled solely from a single tertiary medical center, which may restrict the generalizability of our findings. Third, we theorized that local corticosteroid administration may affect prevertebral soft-tissue swelling, potentially leading to a reduction in UES relaxation pressure; this outcome warrants further investigation. Additionally, research findings on such correlations are variable, and UES IRP values vary widely among different patient groups 7 , 30 , 31 . Furthermore, the extent to which a decrease in UES IRP improves swallowing function remains uncertain 3 , 32 . More extensive studies with larger sample sizes are needed to understand the correlation between UES IRP values and dysphagia, as well as that between UES IRP and prevertebral soft-tissue swelling. Fourth, the force and duration of retraction during surgery may affect postoperative swallowing function but was not directly measured in our study. However, it can reasonably be assumed that the duration was consistent between the groups given the randomized controlled study design. Additionally, the uniformity in surgical technique is reinforced by the fact that all procedures were performed by the same surgeon.\n\nConclusions\n\nLocal intraoperative corticosteroid injections can reduce UES relaxation pressure at 1 month after ACDF, although this finding requires further investigation.\n\nAppendix\n\nSupporting material provided by the authors is posted with the online version of this article as a data supplement at jbjs.org ( http://links.lww.com/JBJS/I246 ).",
