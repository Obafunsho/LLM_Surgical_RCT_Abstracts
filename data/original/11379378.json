  "full_text": "INTRODUCTION\n\nThe development of the surgical learning curve among young cardiothoracic surgery\nresidents has been progressively increasing, especially in frequent procedures such\nas coronary artery bypass grafting, where various skills related to coronary\nanastomoses are needed. However, the limited opportunities for training and\nacquisition of operative skills in the operating room, due to the classic axiom of\npatient safety and integrity above all, has been considered a paradigm that has\nallowed the development and innovation of operative simulation-based surgical\neducation models [ 1 , 2 , 3 ] . This novel\neducational model has spread widely, and more and more specialist training programs\nare using simulation-based curricula, resulting in significant improvements in\nsurgical performance and a great positive impact on the patient. Some studies\ndescribe figures showing a ~75% similarity or superiority (85.5% vs. 72.7%) in the acquisition of operative skills by simulation\nover classical learning techniques, especially procedures based on coronary\nanastomosis [ 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 ] . On the other hand,\nthe implementation of these operative simulation programs, especially for common\nprocedures such as coronary anastomosis, requires a large capital and economic\ninvestment of more than 150000 dollars per year, often becoming an obstacle for\nsurgical training programs in developing countries with limited resources [ 8 , 9 , 10 , 11 ] . Therefore, our work aimed to propose the\nconstruction and surgical training of a portable and low-cost coronary anastomosis\nsimulator, as the first multicenter experience among cardiothoracic surgery\nresidents.\n\nMETHODS\n\nDesign and Sample Size\n\nThis is an observational, analytical, and multicenter study. The coronary\nvascular anastomosis simulator proposed by Cubas et al. [ 12 ] was constructed and\nreplicated, followed by the evaluation of training and acquisition of surgical\nskills with its use. The study sample consisted of all residents, junior (first,\nsecond, and third years) and senior (fourth and fifth years), from nine national\ncardiothoracic surgery centers during 2022. Assessment of the acquisition of\noperative skills and abilities was periodic and continuous (interdaily) for 90\ndays. All training sessions were recorded by video camera, timed, and evaluated\nat a second time point by a group of surgical mentors (senior surgeons). The\nsessions consisted of the creation of end-to-side (E-T-S), end-to-end (E-T-E),\nand side-to-side (S-T-S) coronary anastomoses, and finally, sessions that were\nnot properly documented and evaluated during training were completely excluded\nfrom the study.\n\nDesign, Construction, and Use of The Coronary Anastomosis Simulator\n\nThe replication of this anastomosis simulator was based on the one proposed by\nCubas et al. [ 12 ] , and the main\nprinciples were based on portability, ease of use, and high reproducibility\n( Figure 1 ). The materials used were\ninexpensive ($9.75) and included a plastic container with a lid, small crocodile\nhooks, fine galvanized wire, chrome-plated brackets for curtain installation,\nanchor bolts with nuts, and tools such as pliers and screwdrivers. The coronary\nanastomosis model was reproduced according to the previous prototype. The use of\nthis simulator required thin plastic tubes as well as vascular surgical\ninstruments (Castroviejo, vascular dissection forceps, scissors, and scalpel)\nand 6 and 7-0 polypropylene sutures. The thin plastic tubes were arranged\nparallel for S-T-S anastomoses and perpendicular for E-T-E and E-T-S\nanastomoses.\n\nData Collection and Study Variables\n\nThe primary source of information was observation, and subsequently, the data\nwere selected and sorted chronologically; finally, the data were collected using\na double-entry data entry and checklist. The acquisition of operative skills was\nassessed according to the Objective Structured Assessment of Technical Skills\n(OSATS), and the components of this modified scale included graft orientation,\nbites, spacing, use of needle holder, use of forceps, needle angles, needle\ntransfer, suture management, and tension and were individually scored as 1\n(good), 2 (average), or 3 (poor) as observed by the surgical tutors [ 12 ] . Additionally, the variable\nof vascular anastomosis creation time was considered, and its value was counted\nin minutes. The scores of all described variables were grouped in three groups\naccording to the type of coronary anastomosis (S-T-S, E-T-E, E-T-S), then in two\ngroups according to the type of cardiothoracic surgery resident (junior vs. senior); and both modalities were evaluated in two\n45-day time periods, first period (PP) vs. second period\n(SP).\n\nStatistical Analysis\n\nContinuous data were expressed as mean ± standard deviation and analyzed\nwith paired f-tests to compare scores obtained during FP vs. SP\nin the three types of anastomoses and taking into account the resident’s\ncondition. It was not necessary to assess inter-rater reliability when scoring\nthe anastomosis sessions, as all surgical mentors used the same surgical\nprinciples and the standardized OSATS modified score. Differences were\nconsidered significant at P -value < 0.05, and in all cases,\ndata analysis was performed using STATA MP v16 statistical software for Windows\n10.\n\nEthical Aspects\n\nThe ethical evaluation and feasibility of this study was carried out by the\nDepartment of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery and the Ethics Committee of\nthe Hospital (RCEI-7/134_23), who reviewed and approved the protocol of this\nstudy. The confidentiality of the information and the principles of bioethics\nset out in the Declaration of Helsinki were respected.\n\nRESULTS\n\nA total of 140 cardiothoracic surgery residents from nine academic training centers\nthroughout the national territory were evaluated. The mean age was 29.16 years, and\n69.28% of them were male. All were evaluated in 270 sessions and with an average of\n4,904 minutes of operative performance per simulation. Of the residents, 55.71% were\nclassified as juniors, and it was identified that in S-T-S anastomoses (FP vs. SP), there was a significant improvement in the use of\nCastroviejo needle holder ( P =0.042), needle angles\n( P =0.036), needle transfer ( P =0.029), and\nanastomosis time (25.39 min. vs. 11.22 min., P =0.037). In E-T-S anastomoses, a significant improvement was\nidentified in graft orientation ( P =0.049), appropriate spacing\n( P =0.031), use of Castroviejo needle holder\n( P =0.037), needle angles ( P =0.041), suture\nmanagement and tension ( P =0.045), and anastomosis time (24.01 min. vs. 10.10 min., P =0.048). In E-T-E\nanastomoses, a significant improvement was identified in the use of a Castroviejo\nneedle holder ( P =0.045), needle transfer\n( P =0.018), and anastomosis time (19.55 min. vs. 9.58 min., P =0.041) ( Table\n1 ). Of the residents, 44.29% were classified as senior, and it was identified\nthat in S-T-S anastomoses (FP vs. SP), there was a significant\nimprovement in graft orientation ( P =0.019), appropriate spacing\n( P =0.032), use of forceps ( P =0.045), needle\nangles ( P =0.009), needle transfer ( P =0.043), and\nanastomosis time (19.21 min. vs. 8.11 min., P =0.021). In E-T-S anastomoses, a significant improvement was\nidentified in graft orientation ( P =0.041), appropriate bite\n( P =0.009), appropriate spacing ( P =0.048),\nneedle angles ( P =0.048), needle transfer\n( P =0.012), suture management and tension\n( P =0.049), and anastomosis time (17.45 min. vs. 7.93 min., P =0.023). In E-T-E anastomoses, a significant\nimprovement was identified in graft orientation ( P =0.029),\nappropriate spacing ( P =0.003), use of Castroviejo needle holder\n( P =0.009), use of forceps ( P =0.026), needle\nangles ( P =0.032), needle transfer ( P =0.010), and\nanastomosis time (15.10 min. vs. 6.56 min., P =0.038) ( Table 1 ).\n\nA significant improvement in the final anastomosis time of senior vs. junior residents was identified in S-T-S (8.11 min. vs. 11.22 min.), E-T-S (7.93 min. vs. 10.10\nmin.), and E-T-E (6.56 min. vs. 9.68 min.) anastomoses\n( P =0.039) ( Figure 2 ).\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nTraditional Halsteadian surgical education involves learning skills in an operating\ntheatre in a progressive manner. Although this model has been widely used, multiple\nlimitations may threaten the educational opportunities and learning of operative\nskills with this approach in the current era. In addition, with increasing public\nscrutiny of surgical outcomes and increasing complexity of surgical cases, surgeons\nare less inclined to engage residents, particularly when it comes to time, to\ncomplete a surgical procedure safely and efficiently™. These factors\ncontribute to a high-stress environment that may be suboptimal for medical-surgical\neducation. Thus, surgical simulation in the field of cardiovascular surgery allows\nfor repetitive and safe training of resident skills. Particularly, coronary\nanastomosis is an important and basic skill set in cardiovascular surgery. In the\npresent study, we found that junior and senior residents consistently benefited from\nthe simulator, with a significant decrease in S-T-S, E-T-S, and E-T-E anastomosis\ntime by at least 10 minutes in all cases. A recent study [ 2 ] found that junior residents demonstrated a greater\nmean reduction in anastomosis time (6 minutes and 36 seconds) compared to senior\nresidents (3 minutes and 6 seconds), and Whittaker et al. [ 3 ] suggest that simulators should be used in the\ninitial resident training when the learning curve for trainees is steepest.\n\nInterestingly, in another paper, the data revealed a greater improvement in the\nsenior resident group, speculating that this greater effect may be due to a more\ndeveloped surgical skill set and a greater ability to benefit from repeated exposure\nto skills in this group [ 1 ] . In\nterms of motor skills, significant improvement was observed in the junior resident\ngroup in all types of anastomoses concerning the use of the Castroviejo needle\nholder, followed by improvement in needle manipulation in most types of anastomoses.\nWhile in the senior resident group, a vast improvement was observed in most motor\nskills: graft orientation, proper suture spacing, forceps use, and needle entry\nangle in all types of anastomoses.\n\nA systematic review of coronary artery anastomosis performance showed that simulation\nwas associated with significant improvement in all trainee scores in arteriotomy,\ngraft orientation, depth, suture spacing, Castroviejo/needle holder use, forceps\nuse, needle angles, needle transfer, suture handling, knots, manual mechanics, use\nof both hands, time economy, and anastomosis configuration [ 4 ] . In addition, Takahashi et\nal. [ 5 ] demonstrated that\nformative feedback from mentors significantly improved motor skill components of\ncoronary vascular anastomosis making, and if we add this expert-guided training to\ndeliberate, independent practice by trainees, we obtain significantly higher scores\non the OSATS scale [ 8 ] .\n\nIn other coronary anastomosis simulation models such as beating heart models,\nparticipating trainees showed improved ability concerning technical skills related\nto instrument handling®. Also, in the latter models using human cadavers,\ntraining in all types of anastomosis resulted in the recommendation of a score of at\nleast 48 points on the OSATS before trainees could begin training with patients,\nprogressively improving their score [ 7 ] .\n\nThus, according to our findings along with other studies, simulation was consistently\nassociated with better learning outcomes in terms of anastomosis time. In addition,\nwe highlight that senior residents benefit more from acquiring complex and\nmeticulous motor skills. On the other hand, the results obtained translate into an\nimprovement in both technique and time after the use of the simulator throughout the\nfollow-up period. Regarding the end-overall average score, it was found that senior\nresidents had a significant improvement in S-T-S anastomosis score (2.41 ±\n0.18 to 1.55 ± 0.18; P =0.046) compared to junior residents\n(2.58 ± 0.29 to 1.84 ± 0.14; P =0.067). The latter may\nbe contradictory to the usual findings, such as those found by Nesbitt and Anand et\nal. [ 10 ] where junior\nresidents tend to have a greater and significant improvement in score than senior\nresidents [ 9 ] . This is often\nattributed to the greater amount of time junior residents may have to practice on\nthe simulator compared to senior residents, who while more actively participating in\nsurgery also have less time to practice on the simulator [ 11 , 12 , 13 ] .\n\nThis difference in findings found in our study population may be mainly due to the\nlow patient load which is reflected in fewer surgical practice opportunities in both\nsenior and junior residents. This is seen when comparing the overall average score\nof senior residents vs. junior residents at the beginning of the FP\nof our study, before the use of the simulator, and seeing that there is little\ndifference between the two groups. This highlights the importance of the creation\nand use of simulators, such as ours, that allow continuous practice for surgical\nprocedures.\n\nConcerning the overall average time of anastomosis, a marked decrease could be\nobserved as illustrated in the follow-up curve for all groups, with a significant\nimprovement of senior residents over junior residents. This is contrasted with the\nresults of the end-overall average score and confirms that senior residents had a\ngreater and significant improvement compared to junior residents. This time\nimprovement due to simulator training was also described by Tavlasoglu et\nal. [ 14 ] whose results\nindicated a decrease in anastomosis time (13.65 ± 0.67 to 10.50 ±\n1.10), a reduction in posterior wall damage (30% to 5%), and an increase in patency\n(80% to 95%) with acceptable statistical significance. Similarly, Fann et\nal. [ 15 ] , who designed a\nportable porcine coronary anastomosis simulator model, demonstrated a significant\nimprovement in needle transfer (2.24 ± 0.49 to 1.58 ± 0.50) and suture\nmanagement and tension (2.33 ± 0.62 to 1.58 ± 0.50). Because of these\nresults and new teaching technique that allows them to practice without risk to\npatients, many simulation laboratories have been implemented in hospitals around the\nworld [ 16 , 17 , 18 , 19 ] .\n\nAlthough the transition from the simulator to surgical practice on real patients has\nnot yet been extensively studied in our setting in the field of coronary\nanastomosis, it has been shown that after performing 30 anastomosis procedures on a\nsimulator, the learning curve stabilizes, which is beneficial for the\nresident [ 20 , 21 , 22 ] . Time optimization through practice is beneficial not only\nfor the residents but also for the patients when it comes to these procedures, as\nless time indicates an improvement in the surgeon’s skill, which means fewer\ncomplications. This was observed in a study evaluating 15 cardiothoracic surgeons,\nwhere the risk of mortality decreased significantly after four years of appointment,\npossibly due to the constant practice obtained [ 23 ] .\n\nThis type of simulation-guided training is now a tangible idea and is being promoted\nby organizations such as The Society of Thoracic Surgeons (or STS), The American\nCollege of Surgeons (or ACS), The Thoracic Surgery Residents Association (or TSRA),\nand others through the development of training and accreditation programs using\nsimulators for residents and cardiothoracic surgeons [ 24 , 25 ] .\nConsidering the national context, where most hospitals do not operate on coronary\npatients daily and the price of advanced simulators can be very high, our proposal\nfor the construction and surgical training of a low-cost, portable coronary\nanastomosis simulator is the best option not only for residents but also for newly\nappointed surgeons.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nSimulator training should be incorporated into the curriculum of cardiovascular\nsurgery programs and residents should be offered access to this modality to practice\nindependently, as this increases opportunities for learning and motor skill\ndevelopment, seamlessly integrating technology for safe patient care.",
