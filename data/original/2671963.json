  "title": "Endothelin-A Receptor Inhibition Following Cardiopulmonary Bypass: Cytokines and Receptor Activation",
  "abstract": "Background: Basic studies have suggested that cross-talk exists between the endothelin-A receptor (ET-AR) and tumor necrosis factor signaling pathway. This study tested the hypothesis that administration of an ET-AR antagonist at the separation from cardiopulmonary bypass would alter the tumor necrosis factor activation in the early post operative period.\n\nMethods: Patients (n = 44) were randomized to receive bolus infusion of vehicle, 0.1, 0.5, 1, or 2 mg/kg of the ET-AR antagonist (sitaxsentan) at the separation from cardiopulmonary bypass (n=9, 9, 9, 9, and 8 respectively). Plasma levels of tumor necrosis factor-α and soluble tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 and 2 were measured.\n\nResults: Compared to the vehicle group at 24 hours, plasma levels of tumor necrosis factor-α and tumor necrosis factor receptor 2 (indicative of receptor activation) were reduced in the 1 mg/kg ET-AR antagonist group (by ~13 pg/mL and ~0.5 ng/mL respectively; p<0.05). Plasma tumor necrosis factor receptor I levels also decreased (by ~1 ng/mL) following infusion of the higher doses of the ET-AR antagonist and remained lower (by ~3 ng/mL) at 24 hours post infusion (p<0.05). In addition, a dose effect was observed between the ET-AR antagonist and these indices of tumor necrosis factor activation (p<0.01).\n\nConclusions: This study demonstrated a mechanistic relationship between the ET-AR and tumor necrosis factor receptor activation in the post cardiac surgery period. Thus, in addition to the potential cardiovascular effects, a selective ET-AR antagonist can modify other biological processes relevant to the post cardiac surgery setting. (word count:245/250)",
