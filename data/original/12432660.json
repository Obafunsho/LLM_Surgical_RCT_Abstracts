  "abstract": "The role of post-operative radiotherapy (PORT) in radically resected non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) remains a topic of debate, particularly in pN2 disease. While phase III trials like PORT-C and LungART have demonstrated a significant reduction in mediastinal recurrence, they have failed to show improvements in disease-free survival (DFS) or overall survival (OS), raising concerns about increased cardiopulmonary toxicity. The rapid integration of chemo-immunotherapy and targeted therapies into peri-operative treatment has reshaped the NSCLC landscape, lowering the risk of distant failure and overall mortality while leaving local recurrence rates largely unchanged. Striking results from trials on immune checkpoint inhibitors and tyrosine kinase inhibitors in early-stage NSCLC highlight the potential for improved outcomes, yet the role of PORT in this evolving framework remains uncertain. Preclinical evidence suggests that PORT could enhance loco-regional control when combined with systemic treatments, but the lack of prospective trials exploring this synergy along with unanswered questions about additive toxicity hinders its clinical implementation. There is a critical need for tailored clinical trials that integrate advanced radiation techniques and systemic therapies to further optimize patients’ outcome, both in terms of survival and quality of life. Such studies should focus on balancing the risks of mediastinal relapse, systemic progression and treatment-related toxicities, particularly for PORT-related grade 3 and 4 cardiac or pulmonary events. As treatment strategies continue to evolve, a multidisciplinary and personalized approach will be key to refining the management of resected NSCLC.",

  "full_text": "Introduction\n\nCurrent evidence from clinical trials and international guidelines\n\nThe current role of adjuvant radiotherapy for radically resected non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is still a matter of debate. Based on retrospective data, several large series suggest that there is a survival benefit for patients with surgical positive margins, leading to a favourable recommendation about its routine use in this poor-risk population despite the low level of evidence ( 1 ). Of note, in these case series, patients with macroscopic residual tumour (R2) were underrepresented (less than 4% of the total population), while the majority of patients had microscopic residual tumour (R1) ( 1 , 2 ). On the other hand, it is clear that there is no place for post-operative radiotherapy (PORT) in pN0 or pN1 radically resected tumours, due to its detrimental effect demonstrated in a meta-analysis of the PORT Meta-analysis Trialists Group in 1998 ( 3 ).\n\nFor patients with pN2 disease, however, the role of PORT is still uncertain. Although two phase III trials did not show an overall survival (OS) benefit, they were performed in an era when only adjuvant platinum-based chemotherapy was available and they were relying on partially outdated radiation techniques, such as three-dimensional conformational radiotherapy (3D-CRT). Since then, the treatment landscape has changed for radiotherapy as well as for systemic therapies, influencing the interpretation of the completed phase III trials. In particular, updated radiation techniques resulted in reduced dose to organs at risk, limiting the occurrence of severe toxicities impacting on patients’ survival, and systemic treatments reached great benefits in reducing distant recurrences, thus emphasizing the risk of locoregional failure. Besides, it is crucial to note that prospective trials evaluating PORT for pN2 disease are often challenging, usually because of slow accrual. Difficulties in enrolment might be influenced by strict eligibility criteria, local scepticism regarding the risks of PORT, and the evolution of different radiation techniques.\n\nThe phase III PORT-C trial was published in 2021 and was the first randomized trial evaluating the role of modern PORT in Chinese patients with resected NSCLC, allowing only 3D-CRT or intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) in the experimental arm. In this trial, 394 patients were enrolled, but only 310 patients (of which 140 in the PORT arm) were evaluable per protocol due to the lack of adherence to the radiotherapy requirements. Patients who received PORT had a lower probability of local relapse compared to the control group [hazard ratio (HR) 0.71, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.51–0.97, in the modified intent-to-treat (mITT) population], but this did not translate into an improved disease-free survival (DFS) benefit, likely because of the greater risk of distant failure. Of note, no difference in terms of OS was detected, with an HR of 1.02 (95% CI: 0.68–1.52) in the mITT population. Favourably, no radiotherapy-related grade 4 or 5 adverse events were reported, and only 1 patient had grade 3 radiation pneumonitis (0.7%) ( 4 ).\n\nThese results were confirmed in 2022 by the European LungART multicentre phase III trial. The trial enrolled 501 patients over an 11-year period and showed that PORT significantly reduced the risk of mediastinal relapse (23% in no-PORT arm versus 14% in PORT arm), without impacting on DFS and OS. In addition, adverse events were more common in the PORT group (89% versus 74%), with particular concerns about grade 3 or 4 cardio-pulmonary toxicities that were reported in 11% of the patients in the PORT arm compared to 5% of patients in the control group ( 5 ).\n\nWhen interpreting the results of both the PORT-C and LungART trials, relevant limitations need to be acknowledged. Firstly, in the PORT-C trial, only patients with pIIIA-N2 disease (according to TNM 6th or 7th edition) were considered eligible, ruling out patients with IIIB-N2 disease. In the LungART trial, these patients were not excluded (ipsilateral nodules, i.e., pT4 in different lobes, were allowed per protocol), but their outcomes are not reported in detail, limiting our insights on the efficacy of PORT in this specific population. Although the proportion of these patients selected for surgical treatment is low, they are a particularly high-risk subgroup for local and distant recurrence ( 6 ).\n\nNevertheless, pre-planned exploratory analyses evaluated the extent of surgical resection as a possible selection criterion to maximize the positive effects of PORT. In the PORT-C trial, the number of detected lymph nodes (DLN) as well as the number of positive lymph nodes (PLN), respectively, were examined as risk factors for DFS. The DFS significantly differed after stratification according to the number of DLNs and PLNs (HR 0.75; 95% CI, 0.58–0.98), but selected cut-offs were never published. Moreover, a single cut-off for DLN and PLN may not reliably split risk groups, underlining the need for more complex selection tools that take into account different risk factors.\n\nLikewise, in the LungART trial, a pre-planned central revision of surgical specimens was conducted, re-evaluating extracapsular node invasion, given its detrimental impact on survival as emerged from a previously published meta-analysis ( 7 ). After central review, only 28% of patients were considered radically resected (R0), posing questions about appropriate pathological staging in the remaining 72% of patients and about the predictability of an R0 resection before surgery.\n\nFinally, the most significant limitation is the slow accrual, which prevented these trials from being completed in time to keep up with technological advancements in the field of radiotherapy. When these trials were designed, IMRT was an innovative technique, with an expected benefit, but still to be proven. During the later phase of the trials, IMRT was the standard of care technique, due to a better risk/benefit ratio. The wider use of IMRT in the PORT-C trial was associated with lower PORT-related adverse events, but also the lower dose (50 versus 54 Gy in LungART) and a more conservative clinical target volume definition may have played a role. However, IMRT is now being challenged by new technologies such as proton-therapy, which allows sparing of large volumes of normal organs, including the lymphocyte pool, from low-dose radiation ( 8 ).\n\nThe use of PORT after an incomplete resection, therefore, appears reasonable, despite not being supported by high-quality evidence according to the European Society of Medical Oncology (ESMO) guidelines ( 9 ). This knowledge gap is even more evident for patients with a macroscopic residual disease (R2), who are underrepresented in both prospective and retrospective cohorts. Additionally, given the reduction of locoregional relapse with PORT, it is crucial to identify patients at high risk of mediastinal recurrence among the pN2 population, exploring prognostic pathological variables such as the number of lymph nodes (DLN or PLN) or extracapsular node invasion. Despite the absence of prospective data with large cohorts, PORT may be advised for patients with pN2 disease and more than one risk factor for mediastinal relapse to prevent its occurrence and related symptoms.\n\nHowever, PORT itself can increase short- and long-term toxicities that may negatively impact patients’ quality of life, due to the risk of impaired cardiopulmonary function. Additionally, salvage mediastinal stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) appears to be effective and well-tolerated in very selected patients with a mediastinal relapse after surgery ( 10 ), despite overall higher risks of toxicity, increasing the complexity of patients’ selection in this context.\n\nDiscussion\n\nPort in the era of new perioperative systemic treatments: time for a renaissance?\n\nIn recent years, immunotherapy and targeted therapies have become standard of care options in the perioperative treatment of resectable NSCLC. These novel systemic strategies have improved OS and DFS and altered progression patterns: the DFS gain is mostly driven by a reduction in distant failure rates. Consequently, the relative contribution of locoregional relapses as the first failure site is increasing, as shown in Table 1 . Toxicity profiles of targeted therapies and immunotherapy differ compared to previous chemotherapy-based regimens and may be prolonged if treatments are given long-term. Therefore, this rapidly changing treatment landscape warrants a re-evaluation of the role of PORT for surgically resected NSCLC.\n\nImmunotherapy-based trials\n\nInitially restricted to advanced NSCLC, immunotherapy has become a cornerstone in the treatment of resectable NSCLC. Despite the improvements in DFS and distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS), the risk of local recurrence as the first failure site remains similar to that observed before the immunotherapy era, reinvigorating interest in PORT in this setting.\n\nSome trials evaluating adjuvant or perioperative immunotherapy forbid PORT. In the phase III IMpower010 trial, adjuvant atezolizumab, a programmed-death ligand 1 (PD-L1) inhibitor, demonstrated a significant benefit in DFS in patients with PD-L1 positive resected stage IB–IIIA NSCLC (according to TNM 7th edition) ( 11 ). In the subgroup of patients with PD-L1 expression on 50% or more of tumour cells, there was also an advantage in OS, with 5-year rates reaching 82.7% in the atezolizumab group compared with 65.3% in the control arm ( 12 ). Interestingly, despite reducing the overall risk of recurrence (overall recurrence rate: 37% in the atezolizumab arm versus 50% in the control arm), atezolizumab did not significantly reduce the proportion of patients with local recurrence (locoregional relapse only: 47% of total recurrences in the atezolizumab arm versus 42% of the standard arm) ( 13 ).\n\nLikewise, in the phase II NADIM II trial, which evaluated perioperative nivolumab plus chemotherapy in resectable stage IIIA or IIIB NSCLC (according to TNM 8th ed.), disease progression was observed in 17 patients per group (30% in the experimental arm versus 59% in the standard arm), but local relapse occurred in 7 patients (41%) in the experimental arm and 9 patients (53%) in the standard arm ( 14 ).\n\nOther trials focusing on immunotherapy in the peri-operative setting allowed PORT under specific circumstances. For instance, in the phase III KEYNOTE-671 trial ( 15 ), which evaluated perioperative pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy in resected stage II–IIIB NSCLC (according to TNM 8th ed.), patients with microscopic positive margins (R1), gross residual disease or extracapsular nodal extension were eligible for PORT, while those with completely resected N2 disease were not. Of the 325 patients who underwent surgery in the pembrolizumab group, 18 also received radiotherapy, compared to 35 out of 317 patients in the control arm. The trial met its primary endpoint, which was event-free survival (EFS), however, no data on patterns of recurrence have been published, limiting our insight in the role of distant versus local recurrence.\n\nSimilarly, other phase III trials allowed PORT at investigators’ discretion, such as CheckMate-816 [neoadjuvant nivolumab plus chemotherapy in resectable stage IB to IIIA NSCLC (according to TNM 7th ed.)] ( 16 ), CheckMate-77T [peri-operative nivolumab plus chemotherapy in resectable stage IIA to IIIB NSCLC (according to TNM 8th ed.)] ( 17 ), and AEGEAN [peri-operative durvalumab plus chemotherapy in resectable stage IIA to IIIB NSCLC (according to TNM 8th ed.)] ( 18 ). However, PORT was administered only to a small subset of patients, in particular, in CheckMate-816, only less than 8% of patients received PORT ( 16 ), whilst in the AEGEAN trial, this percentage was around 6.4% ( 18 ). Nevertheless, published data on recurrence patterns in CheckMate-816 confirm that locoregional relapse occurred in 19% and 22% of patients in the experimental arm and in the standard arm, respectively, whilst distant relapses were significantly less in the experimental arm (10% versus 22%) ( 19 ). Additionally, these trials often lack published data on detailed PORT-subgroup analyses, leaving open questions about their integration with immunotherapy strategies.\n\nThe potentially synergistic effects of radiation and immunotherapy have been explored in depth, indeed, even if there is no evidence in the specific peri-operative setting. Radiation not only directly damages tumour cells, but can also stimulate the immune system through multiple mechanisms ( 20 ). Besides inducing DNA double-strand breaks in tumour cells, radiation induces the release of immunostimulatory molecules, remodels the tumour vasculature, and influences the recruitment of lymphocytes to the tumour microenvironment ( 21 ). Additionally, radiotherapy might be able to increase PD-L1 expression on the tumour, making tumours more responsive to immune checkpoint inhibitors ( 21 ). These mechanisms might foster out-of-field benefits of radiation, where the systemic immune response triggered by radiotherapy supports distant tumour regression in the so-called abscopal effect ( 22 ). Furthermore, immunotherapy itself could be a local sensitizer for radiotherapy, improving its efficacy both in preclinical models and clinical series ( 23 ).\n\nThe combination of PORT and immunotherapy does, however, raise concerns about safety, and the potentially immunosuppressive effects of radiation ( 24 ). These effects are influenced by multiple factors, such as the total dose, the fractionation, the overall treatment time, and the dose to key organs like nodes, spleen, and bones containing bone marrow ( 24 ). The scientific interest in novel strategies aiming at lymphocyte sparing is growing ( 25 ), fostering the conduct of tailored clinical trials such as the PACCELIO trial ( NCT06102057 ), evaluating adjustments in dose and target volumes for unresectable NSCLC in order to reduce irradiation of healthy lymphoid structures. These approaches, together with a wider use of IMRT, are paving the way for further clinical trials addressing the interaction between radiation and the immune system.\n\nDespite these concerns, clinical evidence on the safety of sequential or concomitant administration of thoracic radiotherapy and immunotherapy is available. In the phase III PACIFIC trial, evaluating one year of durvalumab maintenance after concurrent chemo-radiation (CTRT) for patients with unresectable stage III NSCLC, the sequential administration was considered safe, with a rate of grade 3 or 4 adverse events of 30% and 26% in the experimental and the standard arm, respectively ( 26 ). Other phase III trials evaluated the concomitant administration of radiotherapy and immunotherapy in patients with unresectable stage III NSCLC, such as the PACIFIC2 trial ( 27 ) and the CheckMate73L trial ( 28 ). In the PACIFIC2 trial, authors confirmed the safety of this regimen, reporting grade 3 and 4 events in 53.4% of patients in the durvalumab arm and in 59% of patients in the placebo arm, without reaching the pre-specified primary endpoints of progression-free survival (PFS) and OS ( 27 ). On the other hand, in the CheckMate73L trial, which was a three-arm trial (nivolumab plus chemoradiotherapy followed by nivolumab, nivolumab plus chemoradiotherapy followed by nivolumab plus ipilimumab and standard chemoradiotherapy followed by durvalumab), the concomitant administration of nivolumab and chemoradiotherapy resulted in higher rates of grade 3 and 4 adverse events (57% versus 49% of patients for nivolumab and standard arm, respectively), higher rates of pneumonitis (4% versus 1% for nivolumab and standard arm, respectively) and treatment-related deaths (4% versus <1% for nivolumab and standard arm, respectively) ( 28 ).\n\nThis conflicting evidence highlights the need for more trials evaluating this synergy in the clinical setting, in particular in the perioperative phase, where many questions are still to be answered. One randomized phase II trial evaluated the safety of a neoadjuvant combination of durvalumab with sub-ablative radiation (three fractions of 8 Gy) in patients with stage I to IIIA NSCLC (according to TNM 7th ed.) ( 29 ). Authors conclude that this combination was not associated with increased mortality or morbidity compared with neoadjuvant durvalumab alone ( 29 ), but numbers are small, and these results might hardly be generalized to the adjuvant phase, where post-surgical recovery has a high impact on patients’ fitness and compliance.\n\nIn conclusion, evidence-based recommendations for the application of PORT in the rapidly evolving landscape of neoadjuvant and peri-operative immunotherapy strategies are challenging to obtain. This is driven by current uncertainties about whom to treat with additional adjuvant immunotherapy after completion of the neoadjuvant phase. Based on a recently published meta-analysis, it is not clear which patients benefit the most from the adjuvant phase, as EFS and OS do not significantly differ between these two treatment strategies ( 30 ). Further research into patterns of failure, risk factors, and biomarkers to guide patient selection for additional adjuvant after neoadjuvant immunotherapy is needed. Patients who remain at a high-risk of locoregional failure might be optimal candidates for PORT.\n\nTargeted therapy-based trials\n\nTargeted therapies with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have also been increasingly explored as a strategy in the treatment of resectable NSCLC with actionable genomic alterations ( 31 ).\n\nFor resected stage IB–IIIA tumours (according to TNM 7th ed.) harbouring an epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-mutation (exon 19 deletion or exon 21 L858R mutation), 3 years of adjuvant osimertinib with or without chemotherapy are recommended by international guidelines such as those from the ESMO ( 32 ) and the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) ( 33 ). In the phase III ADAURA trial ( 34 ), adjuvant osimertinib showed an improvement in both DFS and OS compared to placebo and it significantly reduced both loco-regional only and distant recurrences. In particular, total recurrences were 37 (11%) in the osimertinib arm versus 157 (46%) in the placebo arm, with isolated loco-regional relapses accounting for 62% and 39% of total events in the osimertinib and the placebo arm, respectively ( 35 ). As PORT was not allowed in this trial, the question remains if the benefit of osimertinib can be further improved when PORT is added to the treatment strategy, improving loco-regional control alongside limiting distant recurrences.\n\nOther phase III trials evaluated TKIs targeting EGFR in the adjuvant setting. In the EVIDENCE trial, icotinib or chemotherapy was administered after complete resection in stage II–IIIA EGFR-mutated NSCLC (according to the Diagnosis and Treatment of Primary Lung Cancer 2015 edition), but PORT was per-protocol not allowed ( 36 ). Icotinib doubled the median DFS compared to chemotherapy (from 22 to 47 months), but there are no specific data on recurrence patterns. Moreover, the ADJUVANT trial demonstrated the superiority of gefitinib compared with chemotherapy in terms of DFS in the same setting (completely resected stage II–IIIA EGFR-mutated NSCLC according to TNM 7th ed.) ( 37 ). Only previous radiation therapy was not allowed; however, there is no specific mention of PORT and no analysis on the effect of PORT in combination with gefitinib.\n\nThe recently published phase III ALINA trial evaluated this same approach, but in completely resected anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-rearranged stage IB–IIIA NSCLC according to TNM 7th ed. ( 38 ). Patients were randomized between standard adjuvant chemotherapy or 2 years of adjuvant alectinib, with the experimental arm reaching a 2-year DFS in 93.8% of patients (versus 63% of the standard arm). Moreover, alectinib reduced both loco-regional and distant recurrence (7% versus 17% in the placebo arm for loco-regional only recurrence, 2% versus 17% in the placebo arm for distant recurrence). PORT was allowed for patients with stage IIIA N2 disease at the investigator’s discretion, but only after completion of the randomized systemic treatment (including 2 years of adjuvant TKI), resulting in no subjects receiving adjuvant radiotherapy at the data cut-off date.\n\nOther clinical trials are ongoing to explore targeted therapies in the adjuvant setting, such as the phase III LIBRETTO-432 trial ( NCT04819100 ) for rearranged during transfection (RET)-fusion positive NSCLC after definitive surgery or radiation therapy ( 39 ). However, most of these trials do not allow PORT or only after completion of the adjuvant systemic treatment, which is too late considering the 2 or 3 years of post-surgery TKI treatment. Based on preclinical models, TKIs have a radio-sensitizing potential, which could lead to a synergistic effect when combining them with radiotherapy ( 40 , 41 ). On the other hand, this combination could lead to a higher risk of toxicity, limiting its tolerability in clinical practice ( 42 ).\n\nFinally, it is important to underline that, in TKI-based adjuvant trials, patients with incomplete surgical resection (R1) were not eligible, contrarily to immunotherapy peri-operative trials, where patients with R1 resection were often approved for treatment continuation in the post-surgery phase. This resulted in a lower risk for loco-regional recurrence and consequently no or less expected benefit from PORT. Therefore, the currently available data do not support the use of PORT in the routine management of radically resected oncogene-addicted NSCLC, but emphasize the need for future trials focusing on high-risk features, such as lack of surgical radicality, high nodal burden and insufficient lymphadenectomy extent.\n\nConclusions\n\nThe role of multidisciplinary teams\n\nThe main indication for PORT in resected NSCLC remains the presence of positive margins on surgical samples, i.e., incomplete resection or R1 resection, independently of systemic treatments. Patients with NSCLC undergoing incomplete surgical resection (R1 or R2) are at high risk of relapse, and PORT may improve the OS in this poor-risk population ( 1 ). In the last years, the scientific community has stressed the importance of multidisciplinary discussions in thoracic oncology and of patients’ allocation among different treatment strategies ( 43 ). Borderline-resectable NSCLCs are the target population of many ongoing clinical trials, aiming at exploiting systemic treatments in the induction phase before proceeding to a radical treatment, such as surgery or definitive CTRT ( 44 ). Given the recent improvements of CTRT strategies ( 45 ), patients at high risk for incomplete resection could probably be better referred to a non-surgical approach.\n\nThe importance of patients’ selection\n\nThere is a strong need for better patients’ stratification among the whole pN2 population. PORT can probably have a positive impact on selected individuals, such as those with a high number of positive lymph nodes (PLN/DLN ratio closer to 1) or with evidence of extracapsular invasion, but these factors mostly emerge from retrospective data only ( 46 ), highlighting the need for prospective trials focusing on this topic. Other factors can be taken into account when evaluating PORT, like genetic markers that predict radiation resistance or sensitivity. In a retrospective case-series, tumours with high tumour-mutational burden (TMB) or with deleterious mutations in the DNA-repair pathway [such as ataxia telangiectasia mutated ( ATM ) gene, polymerase epsilon ( POLE ) gene, postmeiotic segregation increased 2 ( PMS2 ) gene, tumor protein 53 binding protein 1 ( TP53BP1 ) gene and AT-rich interactive domain-containing protein 1A ( ARID1A ) gene] experienced a greater benefit from PORT as far as local recurrence was concerned ( 47 ). Many of these mutations are also associated with enhanced sensitivity to immune checkpoint inhibitors ( 48 ), fostering their potential as a synergic strategy. While promising, these findings should be validated in prospective studies before informing clinical practice.\n\nFuture directions\n\nImmunotherapy and targeted therapy have revolutionized perioperative management of early-stage NSCLC patients, resulting in longer survival and an increasing relative risk of locoregional failure. However, recent clinical trials on perioperative immunotherapy and targeted therapy do not provide sufficient information on PORT to firmly draw conclusions about its efficacy in different subgroups. Detailed reports of failure patterns and prognostic factors are needed to identify patients at an increased risk for locoregional failure who may benefit from PORT. However, generally favourable outcomes and low absolute numbers of failure events pose challenges for designing trials on PORT in this setting, considering that the majority of prior randomized trials had challenges with timely accrual. Finally, treatment escalation still poses relevant questions about tolerability, given the high risk of cardiopulmonary toxicities emerging from PORT trials and the long exposure to systemic therapies (1 year for immunotherapies, but 2 or 3 years for TKIs).\n\nIn conclusion, it is very important to evaluate PORT for radically resected NSCLC on an individual basis, as summarized in Figure 1 , balancing the risk of mediastinal relapse with the risk of distant recurrence and death from any cause (cancer-related or toxicity-related events). The need for dedicated clinical trials in this population is emphasized by the multitude of new systemic strategies that enrich the range of possibilities for our patients.\n\nSupplementary",
