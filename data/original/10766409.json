  "title": "The POWER-PAK Score Characterizes Tumor Response to Three Months of Preoperative Endocrine Therapy",
  "abstract": "Background:: The P re- O perative W indow of E ndocrine Therapy to Inform R adiation Therapy Decisions (POWER, NCT04272801 ) Trial aims to determine whether 3 months of pre-operative endocrine therapy (pre-ET) informs adjuvant radiation therapy decisions among older women with early-stage, ER-positive breast cancer. We propose the POWER Pathologic Assessment and Ki-67 (POWER-PAK) scoring system to characterize the histologic effects of pre-ET.\n\nMethods:: Histologic evaluation was performed on core biopsy and lumpectomy specimens from 37 POWER Trial participants who completed pre-ET and surgery. The POWER-PAK score consists of tumor regression, decrease in Ki-67 expression, and ER expression, each ranging from 0 to 2. Scores were aggregated to create the POWER-PAK score with a range from 0 to 6. Participants with no residual tumor were labelled “6-NRT”.\n\nResults:: ER expression did not decrease after pre-ET. Ki-67 decreased from 13% in biopsy specimens to 5% in the lumpectomy specimens (p<0.001). Cellularity decreased from 40% to 23% (p<0.001). There was heterogeneity of POWER-PAK scores ranging from 2 to 6-NRT: score 2, n=2 (5.4%); 4, n=8 (21.6%); 5, n=4 (10.8%); 6, n=16 (43.2%); 6-NRT, n=7 (18.9%). Participants with a score ≥5 were more likely to have smaller tumors after pre-ET compared to those with a score <5 (p = 0.04).\n\nConclusions:: The tumor responses following treatment with pre-ET are heterogenous. We propose that the POWER-PAK scoring system can be used to quantify response to pre-ET. Future studies will explore the use of POWER-PAK to support informed decision-making for adjuvant therapy options for older women with early-stage breast cancer.",
