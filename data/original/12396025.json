  "full_text": "Background\n\nChronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH) is diagnosed in 0.1–3.8% of pulmonary embolism (PE) survivors. 1 The disease is characterized by unresolved, organized thromboembolic material that partially or completely obliterates large pulmonary arteries. Over time, this triggers the development of a secondary microvasculopathy, caused by redistribution of blood flow to unob structed regions and the development of anastomoses between hypertrophic systemic bronchial arteries and the pulmonary circulation in ob structed regions. 2 Both pulmonary vascular obstructions and microvasculopathy contribute to the cascade of increasing pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR), worsening pulmonary hypertension (PH), right ventricular (RV) failure, and eventually death. 3\n\nThe unresolved, organized thrombo-embolic material can surgically be removed. Reasons to consider removal of the obstructive disease are hemodynamic: improve RV function, respiratory: decrease death space ventilation and prophylactic: to halt the progressive RV dysfunction and retrograde extension of the disease and to prevent the development of microvasculopathy that can only by treated (but not cured) by PH-specific medication with variable success. 4 Therefore timely diagnosis and interventional treatment are crucial. Unfortunately, CTEPH is characterized by both an under- and delayed diagnosis. Its most recent estimated incidence is 12.2/million inhabitants/year, still more than twice as high as seen in registry data, while also a median delay of 14 months between the first clinical presentation and the final diagnosis has been described. 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 Both underdiagnosis and diagnostic delay are related to: (1) the nonspecific clinical presentation (exertional dyspnea and exercise intolerance); (2) not considering pulmonary vascular disorders in patients with unexplained dyspnea resulting in diagnostic misclassifications; (3) discounting the possibility of CTEPH in absence of a history of acute venous thromboembolism; (4) and lack of awareness of the disease entity by many physicians. 9 , 10\n\nDiagnosis of CTEPH\n\nAs 25% of CTEPH patients have no documented history of acute PE, CTEPH should always be ruled out in patients with PH signs on echocardiography that cannot be explained by left-sided heart pathology. In the context of acute PE, CTEPH should be considered: (1) if radiological signs suggest CTEPH on the computed tomography (CT) pulmonary angiography performed to diagnose PE, and/or if estimated systolic pulmonary artery (PA) pressure is 60 mm Hg on echocardiography; (2) when dyspnoea or functional limitations persist in the clinical course post-PE (after 3 months of effective anticoagulation); and (3) in asymptomatic patients with risk factors for CTEPH. 3 Clinical conditions such as permanent intravascular devices, inflammatory bowel diseases, certain coagulation disorders, splenectomy, antiphospholipid syndrome, high-dose thyroid hormone replacement, and malignancy are risk factors. 11\n\nA ventilation/perfusion scintigraphy remains the most effective tool in excluding CTEPH and patients with mismatched perfusion defects should be send to specialized CTEPH centers. 3 In such centers a right heart catheterization and CT pulmonary angiography will be used to diagnose CTEPH and to assess its operability. Digital subtraction angiography is used to assess treatment options when CT pulmonary angiography is inconclusive. 3 The multidisciplinary team in a specialized CTEPH center will (1) confirm CTEPH diagnosis; (2) determine operability; (3) determine balloon pulmonary angioplasty (BPA) potential; (4) determine the appropriateness of medical therapy and/or multimodal approach; and (5) follow-up/review previously treated patients. Therefore it requires the presence of experienced PH radiologists, experienced pulmonary endarterectomy (PEA) surgeons, CTEPH/PH physicians, BPA interventionalists, a coordinator, PEA/PH specialist nurses and multidisciplinary team administration. 12\n\nPulmonary endarterectomy\n\nThe unresolved, organized thromboembolic material can surgically be removed from the PA’s. This major procedure requires sternotomy and is called a pulmonary endarterectomy (PEA), also often referred to as pulmonary thromboendarterectomy (PTE). After initiating cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) and placing venting catheters through the right upper pulmonary vein and in the PA, the right PA is exposed and incised using a spreader between the superior caval vein and the ascending aorta ( Figure 1A ). Subsequently a dissection plan is created between the intima and media of the PA ( Figure 2A ). However, back-bleeding, originating from the (in CTEPH well developed) bronchial collateral circulation, usually precludes adequate visualization to continue the dissection beyond the lobar level. Therefore, deep hypothermic circulatory arrest (DHCA) is applied: by using the CPB, the patient is cooled until a core temperature of 20°C has been reached, which allows repetitive periods of circulatory arrest. The CPB is stopped and 3–4 liters of blood are drained into the CPB reservoir. This allows to continue the dissection in a bloodless surgical field and to completely clear the PA tree. After right PA closure, the heart is lifted toward the right side using a mesh retractor or 2 crosswise positioned gauzes, one under the inferior caval vein and the other through the transverse sinus ( Figure 1B ). Subsequently, the left PA endarterectomy is performed similarly. Figure 2B shows an example of resected specimens from both PA’s. Then the patient is rewarmed, weaned from CPB, and the sternum is closed. The detailed surgical technique has been described extensively elsewhere. 4 , 13 , 14 , 15 PEA is the only potentially curative therapy and therefore remains the treatment of choice. 16 , 17\n\nOperability assessment and patient selection\n\nDetermining surgical candidacy involves 2 separate processes: (1) an evaluation of technical operability; and (2) an assessment of the potential risks and benefits of surgery (patient selection). Technical operability ultimately depends on both the anatomic location of the disease and the skill and experience of the surgeon. Proper patient selection remains crucial. This is clearly illustrated by the poor prognosis of operable CTEPH patients who refuse surgery (but are often treated with BPA and/or drugs instead). 17 , 18 , 19 Moreover, perioperative PEA mortality rates in international registries continue to improve, decreasing from 4.7 to 3.2% over the past decade. 17 , 20 PEA is also associated with the least likelihood of needing long-term PH medication treatment and with the most evidence for sustained improvement in symptoms, function, QoL and survival. 17 , 19 , 20 , 21 However, although technically feasible, in certain circumstances PEA might be ill advised. Severe parenchymal lung disease is the only absolute contraindication because the attempted improvement in perfusion may not improve symptoms if ventilation is severely compromised, and the risk of postoperative respiratory failure is significant. 4 Except terminal or end stage disease states, no other comorbid conditions are absolute contra-indications to PEA. However, some coexisting conditions impose an increased risk on less favorable peri-operative and long-term outcomes: an absent history of deep vein thrombosis or PE, signs of right heart failure, significant pulmonary or left heart disease, World Health Organization functional class IV, inconsistency on imaging modalities, absence of appreciable lower lobe disease, PVR >1,200 dynes.s/cm 5 , out of proportion to site and number of obstruction on imaging; and higher diastolic PA pressure. 22 These risk factors do not represent an absolute contraindication to PEA and should be weighed against the potential symptomatic benefits of PEA and discussed with the patient by the multidisciplinary CTEPH team. 23\n\nTechnical challenges and controversies\n\nCTEPH and PEA have been extensively discussed in literature in the past 3 decades and very recently an up-to-date state-of-the-art review has been published. 24 However, many practices and minor technical aspects still rely solely on the preferences of the center or on the opinion of experts and can therefore provoke controversy. As worldwide, the awareness of CTEPH as a disease entity is growing, as more and more surgeons have been trained or are in training to perform this procedure and more centers express their interest in treating CTEPH patients, these controversies become more prevalent. Because clear guidelines or studies on these practices are lacking, this review aims to discuss the rationale for them, and to gather the currently existing evidence from literature together with the recommendations from experts in the field.\n\nMethods\n\nUpon invitation by The Journal of Heart and Lung Transplantation Open, the lead author (T.V.) solicited the PEA surgeons from the 4 CTEPH centers known to currently report on the highest volumes of PEA surgery worldwide. 25 Technical challenges and controversies of the PEA procedure were identified, a PubMed search of the recent literature was performed, and all author’s own experiences and opinions were put together to develop a narrative current state-of-the-art review and consensus.

Minimal access pulmonary endarterectomy techniques 9. The required surgical expertise\n\nTechnical challenges and controversies\n\nAcute normovolemic hemodilution\n\nAcute normovolemic hemodilution (ANH) is a 2nd pillar patient blood management strategy in which a volume of whole blood is drawn after anesthesia induction. Some centers prefer to do this before heparin administration. The blood is then stored bedside with anticoagulants at room temperature. In other centers the withdrawal is performed after heparinization, via the CPB circuit, just before going on CPB. Normovolemia is maintained by administration of replacement crystalloid or colloid solution. The stored blood is generally readministered in the operating room, or at least the infusion is initiated in the operating room. 26\n\nIn contrast to allogenic blood transfusion, hemolysis, coagulation, or immunological activity have not been observed in withdrawn blood for ANH. 27 Consequently, allogeneic blood transfusion is associated with dose-dependent, worse short- and long-term outcomes than autologous blood transfusion. 28 , 29 A positive benefit-risk ratio for ANH has been suggested when at least 650 ml whole blood is withdrawn. 26 Guidelines recommend considering ANH in adult cardiac surgery patients because of its anticipated benefits: (1) preservation of blood cells and coagulation factors from surgical spilling and damage or consumption in the CPB circuit, resulting in reduced coagulopathy, bleeding and allogeneic blood transfusion and their associated complications and costs, and (2) improved perfusion and tissue oxygen delivery during CPB through a decreased blood viscosity. 27 , 30 , 31 , 32 However, systematic reviews that support this recommendation have not included CTEPH patients undergoing PEA. 27 , 33 Many PEA patients inherently have an increased blood viscosity (increased hematocrit) and need DHCA, thus would uniquely benefit more than other cardiac surgical patients.\n\nHowever, for CTEPH patients undergoing PEA, evidence supporting its effectiveness in reducing perioperative bleeding and allogeneic blood transfusion is scarce. 34\n\nRetrospective analyses regarding the use of ANH in PEA surgery will inevitably be affected by confounding variables, e.g., anesthesiologists who perform ANH may also adhere more to other patient blood management strategies, thereby introducing performance bias. Also, ANH may not be pursued due to low hematocrit levels and poor left or RV function, but without clear cutoff values for these parameters.\n\nIn conclusion, although the effect of ANH on mortality may be limited, its potential to reduce allogeneic blood transfusion with its associated complications and costs make the authors plea to set up a prospective randomized controlled trial (RCT) on ANH during PEA in which the exclusion criteria and the use of other blood management strategies are clearly defined.\n\nDeep hypothermic circulatory arrest\n\nUse of glucocorticoids\n\nThe use of glucocorticoids in DHCA piglet experiments is associated with improved cardiac function, less systemic inflammation, less pulmonary dysfunction and PH, and with possible positive effects on neuronal cell injury and cerebral edema. 35 , 36 , 37 , 38 , 39 , 40 , 41 , 42 , 43 One DHCA piglet study reported however that methylprednisolone failed to attenuate neuronal cell injury. 44 All these studies were small sample sized and assessed biomarkers with unclear clinical relevance. Extrapolating these findings to human clinical use should therefore be done cautiously, as also clinical trials are very scarce. Kerr et al. could demonstrate decreased plasma cytokine levels but no effect on lung injury or mortality in a RCT using methylprednisolone or placebo in adults undergoing DHCA during PEA. 45\n\nWe can therefore not advise in favor or against the use of glucocorticoids during PEA. Interestingly, preclinical work suggests that systemic administration of steroids 4–6 hours prior to the start of CPB decreases the systemic inflammatory response and brain damage, while steroid administration during CPB had no effect. 41 , 43 It can therefore be considered to administer steroids in clinic the evening before PEA (e.g., prednisolone 1 mg/kg at 22:00 hours).\n\nTopical head cooling\n\nCold extracorporeal perfusion is the single most efficacious mode of cerebral protection. The rationale to use topical head cooling (THC) on top of this arises from the concern that brain hypothermia generated in the run-up to DHCA would not be or remain uniform due to (1) anatomic, disease and vasoregulatory influences that produce imperfect cerebral circulations; (2) the low, but persisting cerebral metabolism; and (3) surrounding tissues and objects in the operating room that transfer heat. 46\n\nThe theoretical benefits of THC during DHCA have been demonstrated in several animal trials. THC further decreases brain temperature during cerebral circulatory arrest (CCA), improves cerebral metabolism recovery post-DHCA, and leads to more rapid behavioral recovery compared to its nonuse. 47 , 48 , 49 Wrapping heads in a circulating cold water blanket during PEA results in significant lower tympanic membrane than bladder or rectal temperatures but does not cause clear clinical benefits. 50 THC is currently recommended, but many PEA centers do not use it. 51 , 52 Some fear the interference of THC with cerebral oximetry monitors. 53 Others question its meaningful effect because of the poor conductance capacity of the human skull and the usually limited temperature gradient between the operating room and the brain during DHCA. 53 Moreover, concomitant antegrade cerebral perfusion (ACP), rather than THC, appears to provide the greatest neuroprotection for animals undergoing DHCA. 48 Also, the experimental designs were not consistent with the clinical use of DHCA during PEA. Based on historical aortic arch surgery practices, all animals underwent DHCA periods between 45 minutes and 2 hours. 47 , 48 , 49 , 54 During PEA, DHCA is however applied intermittently, i.e., maximum 20 minutes followed by 10 minutes of reperfusion after which DHCA can be reapplied if deemed necessary. The true duration of CCA during PEA is significantly lower and the meaningful effect of THC can be questioned as the protective effect of cold cerebral reperfusion after 20 minutes is probably much more important. When a higher cerebral temperature and shorter duration targets of CCA are used (see Section: Temperature, number and duration of circulatory arrests), the temperature gradient between the brain and surrounding environment might even be negligible, which further questions the usefulness of THC. One animal study demonstrated worse neurological outcomes when THC was applied during rewarming after DHCA, possibly due to the loss of cerebral vasoregulation and cerebral oedema. 55\n\nGiven the absence in literature of any harmful effect or clinical benefit, but given the theoretical benefit of THC, some authors recommend its use during PEA, as long as it is not used during rewarming and does not interfere with cerebral oximetry monitoring.\n\nTemperature, number and duration of circulatory arrests\n\nComplete removal of all fibrotic tissue is essential during PEA. Circulatory arrest generates the necessary completely bloodless operating field. The temperature during circulatory arrest is however debatable. Cerebral metabolism increases linearly when temperature rises, leading to more ischemia. 56 Conversely, lower temperature increases the risk of coagulopathy, hyperglycemia, and acidemia, related to increased CPB times to cool and rewarm. 57 , 58 , 59 Many institutions have therefore moved towards moderate hypothermia with adjuvant perfusion strategies for aortic arch surgery, according to current guidelines. 60 However, adding ACP increases surgical complexity and the risk of atherosclerotic emboli. 61 Moreover, the duration of DHCA itself seems to be the primary prognosticator of mortality and neurologic injury. Uysal et al. found a significant decline in neurocognition with prolonged arrest times between 39 and 83 minutes in patients undergoing aortic arch surgery with DHCA and ACP, while DHCA alone between 14 and 40 minutes was not associated with cognitive dysfunction. 62 During PEA however, intermittent DHCA periods of about 20 minutes are applied. Therefore, ACP during PEA can be considered redundant. This was convincingly demonstrated in the PEACOG RCT in which no difference in neurological outcome was found between PEA patients undergoing DHCA alone vs DHCA with ACP, while cognitive function improved in both groups. 63 Of note, 23% of patients even had to cross over from ACP to DHCA to halt collateral bronchial flow and allow complete endarterectomy. 63\n\nHowever, DHCA remains associated with multiorgan dysfunction manifesting as coagulopathy (less problematic in CTEPH patients, likely due to factor VIII release), respiratory and renal failure and neurocognitive dysfunction. 64 , 65 With DHCA alone, any neurological complication following PEA have been reported at 11.2% of patients (0.8% permanent) and are related to circulatory arrest time. 66 A critical threshold for neurologic events may lay around a cumulative DHCA time of 60 minutes. 65 , 66 , 67 As neurological complications are presumably a manifestation of inadequate brain perfusion and cooling, using near-infrared spectroscopy to monitor regional cerebral oxygenation saturation (rSO 2 ) is recommended. 68 The duration of rSO 2 < 40% during DHCA seems associated with neurological complications after PEA. 68 , 69 But also slow rewarming is associated with neurological improvement. 70\n\nThe Pavia PEA technique uses moderate hypothermia (24°C) and intermittent periods of circulatory arrest limited to 7–10 minutes followed by short periods of reperfusion (5–7 minutes). 71 The Pavia group reported on a tendency to have less postoperative neurologic events compared to DHCA (7.1 vs 17.6%), despite significantly longer total circulatory arrest times (85 vs 26 minutes) and on a better cognitive function 3 months after PEA. 72 , 73 Recently Ishida et al. reported on their experience using the Pavia technique. 65 A significant association between prolonged circulatory arrest time and neurologic events was found. Surprisingly enough, neurologic adverse events exclusively occurred with DHCA at an incidence of 29%, indicating that multiple short periods of moderate hypothermic circulatory arrest may effectively prevent neurologic complications. A possible explanation is that these short periods helped to prevent a substantial decrease in rSO 2 <40%. 65 Off note, the postoperative incidence of neurological complications reported by the Pavia group (17.6%) and by Ishida (29%) are remarkably higher than the incidence of 11.2% reported by the aforementioned international registry.\n\nIn summary, in contrast to aortic arch surgery, PEA surgery allows a strategy of intermittent circulatory arrest which makes ACP redundant and even contraindicated. Risk factors for neurological adverse events with DHCA are cumulative circulatory arrest times >60 minutes and possibly proximal disease. However, ultimately the most important goal of PEA is to normalize the PA pressures. Therefore this goal should always be balanced against the risk of longer CCA times, particularly in young patients. To prevent neurological adverse events prolonged rSO 2 <40% should be avoided and a higher number of shorter duration CCA might be more appropriate. A prospective RCT is needed to objectify the potential advantages of the Pavia technique.\n\nAortic cross clamping and cardioplegia\n\nThe cooling process in the run-up to DHCA induces ventricular fibrillation that requires left ventricular venting. The creation and continuation of the dissection plane in the PA tree is hampered by antegrade RV blood flow and by retrograde bronchial collateral flow. The antegrade flow can be decreased by bicaval snaring and by using a PA venting catheter but will not stop completely as blood continues coming from the coronary sinus. Aortic cross clamping and antegrade cardioplegia administration preceding DHCA not only ensure good myocardial protection, but also completely stop this antegrade flow. This allows to create and continue the dissection plane in a more comfortable manner before applying DHCA. It also allows manipulation of the ascending aorta which can be retracted to better expose the right main PA without causing aortic insufficiency. This allows proximal exposure and dissection, thereby reducing DHCA time while not worrying about left ventricular dilation. Another advantage of complete cardiac arrest is that it relaxes the myocardium, which can improve access to the left PA in cases with severe RV hypertrophy. To avoid cardioplegia entering the systemic circulation, it can be aspirated from the right atrium. 74\n\nHowever, cardioplegia may lead to reperfusion injury, myocardial edema and diastolic dysfunction. 75 , 76 The aortic clamp may conflict with the forceps, adds complexity to the procedure and might increase the risk on cerebral thromboemboli. 77 A lot of experience with cardiac surgery on fibrillating heart has been obtained in redo-mitral valve surgery via right thoracotomy. 78 , 79 , 80 , 81 , 82 , 83 Compared to aortic clamping, less postoperative inotropic requirements and hospital mortality are reported by some. 78 , 80 The use of this technique in primary valve surgery has also demonstrated a very low rate of postoperative neurological complications. 84 , 85 Concerns regarding myocardial protection and removal of air have however been raised. 83 But compared to mild hypothermia used in these reports, the moderate to deep hypothermia used in PEA should offer better myocardial protection. A correlation was moreover demonstrated between aortic clamping time and peak concentrations of creatine kinase and its myocardial fraction while the duration of ventricular fibrillation seemed to have no influence on myocardial damage. 86\n\nTherefore, in theory, PEA without aortic cross clamping and cardioplegia could be feasible and safe, and possibly even provide some advantages with regards to myocardial protection and risk on neurological complications. Interestingly, the Pavia technique also excludes aortic clamping and cardioplegia, using moderate hypothermia. 65 , 71 Moreover, also in the minimal access PEA technique described by Madani et al. aortic cross clamping was not possible, although DHCA was still performed. 87 , 88 The experienced co-authors also report acceptable experience in patients with very diseased or porcelain aorta, where aortic cross clamping was avoided, but advocate to be very careful in cases of aortic valve insufficiency and to be cognizant of possible air in the aortic cannula. As such the feasibility and safety of PEA with a fibrillating heart has already been demonstrated. Also here, a prospective RCT is needed to objectivate its potential advantages.\n\nConcomitant surgical procedures\n\nAn international prospective long-term CTEPH registry identified the need for additional cardiac procedures as a risk factor for mortality after PEA. 20 However, not addressing severe concomitant pathologies could increase mortality even more, and centers report good and even similar outcomes in patients that underwent PEA with concomitant cardiac procedures vs isolated PEA. 89 , 90 The authors therefore strongly advise to carry out concomitant coronary, valvular or ascending aortic procedures in accordance with the respective guidelines.\n\nPatent foramen ovale management\n\nAs an atrial septostomy has been shown to provide symptomatic improvement to those with severe PH, it might be tempting to leave a patent foramen ovale (PFO) untouched during PEA, especially in CTEPH patients with severe RV dysfunction. 91 However, the presence of a PFO seems not to impact survival in PH patients. 92 Moreover, a recent systematic review and meta-analysis demonstrated that the commonly seen PFO in patients with acute PE is associated with a higher incidence of ischemic stroke and increased mortality. 93 Given the known prothrombotic state in many CTEPH patients, as well as the use of central lines and catheters for postop management, with their associated risks of thrombus or air emboli, most authors recommend closing all PFO’s during surgery. In rare circumstances of severe PH and RVF, when the surgeon encounters no CTEPH or very minimal disease (i.e., misdiagnosis) and he/she expects severe residual PH, the surgeon should weigh the risks versus the benefits of PFO closure.\n\nManagement of intravascular leads and total implantable central venous access systems\n\nThe leads of cardiac implantable electronic devices are a known risk factor for CTEPH. 94 We therefore recommend fully explanting all leads at the time of surgery, and replacing them epicardially typically during rewarming time, and just before coming off bypass to have appropriate threshold measurements. Invariably, one encounters the source of the emboli at the superior caval vein/right atrial junction. It is not uncommon to also see tricuspid valve involvement with some degree of regurgitation. It is important that the valve is also addressed at this time, if needed. In most cases, the valve can be repaired, replacements are very rarely necessary.\n\nTotal implantable central venous access systems are also known risk factors for CTEPH. 95 They should be removed in patients with cancer in complete remission to avoid the development of CTEPH and certainly as soon as CTEPH is diagnosed. Consequently, it is imperative the surgeon removes the system, if still in place during surgery, to avoid CTEPH recurrence.\n\nManagement of atrial fibrillation\n\nAtrial fibrillation (Afib) is not uncommonly observed in CTEPH patients. 96 The known prothrombotic conditions in many CTEPH patients provide an extra argument to adhere to the most recent guidelines and the authors therefore strongly recommend concomitant surgical closure of the left atrial appendage in patients with Afib undergoing PEA to prevent ischemic stroke and systemic thromboembolism. 96 , 97 The pathophysiological mechanisms that cause Afib in CTEPH may be different than in valvular heart disease, therefore a concomitant right-sided ablation in these patients may be more appropriate, however this topic does not seem to have been addressed in the literature yet. Some authors of this paper therefore consider to perform full Cox-Maze in all patients with persistent or paroxysmal Afib, in accordance with the guidelines on non-mitral valve cardiac surgery, unless it is a true case of supraventricular tachycardia, in which the surgeon may limit its treatment to a right-sided ablation. 97\n\nConcomitant tricuspid valve repair\n\nTricuspid valve regurgitation (TR) in the setting of PH seems to be initiated by RV remodeling in the longitudinal direction, causing increased valvular tethering. 98 A successful reduction in PVR following PEA should therefore be able to cause RV reverse remodeling and regression of TR. Indeed, leaflet area, tenting volume and tenting height in CTEPH patients are comparable to control subjects 12 months following PEA. 99 Many other papers have also reported on a restoration of tricuspid valve (TV) function in the vast majority of CTEPH patients after PEA. 99 , 100 , 101 , 102 Therefore, until recently, the common advice was not to perform TV repair in case of moderate to severe TR unless there is an anatomic abnormality with the valve leaflets, chords, or overall structure. 4 Moreover, residual TR is linked to persistent PH. 103 , 104 Also, a clear relationship between the surgical-anatomical classification of the disease on one hand and residual TR and persistent PH on the other hand has been demonstrated. 101 , 105 , 106 Even in cases of complete removal of the fibrotic tissue during PEA, secondary microvasculopathy can still explain persistent PH and residual TR. The recommendation not to perform concomitant TV repair during PEA as such makes sense. Hence, in case of persistent PH, functional TR may help to prevent a further elevation of mean PA pressure (mPAP) leading to RV failure (the so-called pop-off effect), while in case of a successful decrease in PVR, the RV reverse remodeling has the potential to significantly reduce TR in the weeks/months following surgery. 99 , 101 , 104 , 107\n\nHowever, not all moderate to severe TR restores to mild or trivial after a successful PEA. 103 , 104 , 107 , 108 Reversible RV longitudinal remodeling with its associated valvular tethering might just be the first stage in the pathophysiology of TR in CTEPH. Secondary factors may come into play that are less amenable to reverse remodeling, despite a significant reduction in PVR. Hayashi et al. recently demonstrated a significant difference in axial RV dimensions but not in RV longitudinal dimensions between CTEPH patients with and without residual TR after PEA. 109 TV annulus dilation can also be caused by Afib. 110 , 111 Moreover, Afib and TR predispose to one another. 112 But if Afib in CTEPH always occurs as a consequence of TR caused by valvular tethering or can also emerge independently needs to be investigated. In any case, Afib is frequently observed in CTEPH patient and has also been linked with residual TR after PEA by several groups. 96 , 101 , 104 , 109 The duration of RV pressure and RA volume overload might also play a role in reduced TV plasticity. The fibrous structure of the TV annulus, once chronically dilated, might not be able anymore to fully retrieve its original size regardless of the absolute reduction in PVR. 99 , 104 Residual TR might also be a manifestation of declining heart valve plasticity observed in patients with increased age. 101 , 113 Although Sadeghi et al. reported that severe TR and TV annulus dilatation can improve without annuloplasty, some expert centers nowadays consider concomitant TV repair during PEA in cases of severe TR and/or a severely dilated TV annulus and report on favorable hemodynamic results. 104 , 114 , 115 Hayashi et al. recently also suggested that concomitant TV procedures at the time of PEA may have potential benefits for patients with risk factors such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, Afib, and increased age for residual TR. 109 But it remains uncertain if concomitant TV repair would improve clinical outcome or survival. The recently reported negative influence of residual TR after PEA on long-term survival does however support this strategy. 109 , 116 We propose to perform a concomitant tricuspid annuloplasty during PEA in cases of moderate or severe TR if the TV annulus has a diameter ≥40 mm or >21 mm/m² on 2D echocardiography, in accordance with the guidelines for concomitant TV surgery with left sided valve surgery. 117 We plea however to apply a liberal sizing strategy, i.e., rather oversizing, to determine the size of the annuloplasty ring, certainly if risk factors for residual PH are present. Hence a slightly oversized annuloplasty ring might reduce the TV annulus diameter sufficiently to reduce the TR grade from severe to mild and to as such avoid significant congestion, while it could still allow the pop-off effect in case of persistent PH to avoid acute RV failure. A prospective RCT is needed to provide more evidence. The authors would however like to emphasize that TV annular repair should be prohibited in CTEPH patients without PEA, in cases of incomplete endarterectomy, or those with anticipated persistent PH after PEA.\n\nSpecific patient populations\n\nPatients of older age\n\nAlthough survival after PEA appears to be reduced in the over 80 years group, no difference was noticed with a reference age- and sex-matched population. 118 Improvement in functional capacity also seemed to be lower in this group. 73 , 118 However also a greater number of concomitant cardiac surgeries was seen, indicating that their improvement is multifactorial. 118 Several groups have reported on very good outcomes for PEA in the elderly and concluded that, although age may play a role in the multifactorial selection process for PEA, older age alone should not be a contraindication. 73 , 118 , 119 , 120\n\nPediatric patients\n\nPEA in the pediatric population is rare. Six centers have reported on individual case-reports, 1 center on a case-series of 2 patients and 1 center on a case-series of 3 patients with ages ranging between 6 months and 13 years. 121 , 122 , 123 , 124 , 125 , 126 , 127 , 128 Taking into account reporting bias while relying on these case-reports, all of these patients successfully underwent a PEA. The only comprehensive cohort of PEA in the pediatric population described so far is by Madani et al., with an age ranging between 8 and 17 years. 129 Only 3 of these 17 patients were in the same prepuberal age range as the pediatric patients in the aforementioned case-reports, but PEA was also successfully carried out in all of them. Based on the experience in these 28 pediatric patients, we can conclude that pediatric CTEPH is certainly amenable for PEA with excellent hemodynamic and survival outcomes. However, a higher rate of rethrombosis in these pediatric patients was seen. 129 As all of these 28 patients had major prothrombotic risk factors, pediatric patients probably represent a distinct population within CTEPH, that merits further research. Given the fact that the latest report of the San Diego group on these pediatric patients dates from 2011 and that many other high-volume centers have not yet reported on this specific patient population, one may presume the actual worldwide experience of PEA in the pediatric population is currently underreported. A large retrospective worldwide data collection on this subject could therefore be of interest.\n\nObese patients\n\nObese patients are expected to have a higher risk for intraoperative and postoperative adverse events, including mortality due to the association of obesity with complex anatomy, deep surgical situs, prolonged intensive care unit stay, delicate ventilation, delayed weaning, tracheostomy, pulmonary infections, diabetes, impaired wound healing, sternal dehiscence, orthopedic problems, and immobilization. 130 However, multiple studies examined the relationship between obesity and adverse outcomes after cardiac surgery and concluded that obesity does not affect the risk on morbidity and mortality while some even showed that obesity was a protective factor for postoperative mortality. 131 , 132 , 133 , 134\n\nFor PEA, obesity also seems not to affect outcomes. The San Diego group reported on similar in-hospital mortality, similar postoperative complications and median length of hospital stay comparing 4 different body mass index (BMI) groups. 135 In an international prospective CTEPH registry, BMI was not identified as risk factor for postoperative mortality. 20 The Papworth group recently analyzed the effect of BMI in their cohort and reported similar hemodynamic outcomes in all groups. Only patients with BMI > 50 were at greater risk for long-term all-cause mortality and to experience residual symptomatic limitation. 136 High BMI should therefore not be seen as a contra-indication for PEA. As an example, a recent video illustrates the feasibility of PEA using an inverted-T upper hemisternotomy in a patient with a BMI of 53 kg/m² with an uncomplicated post-operative hospital stay of 7 days. 74\n\nPatients with surgical accessible disease with concomitant high PVR\n\nHistorically, high PVR was considered a potential contraindication to surgery. 8 Indeed, especially if patients present with a combination of a PVR >1,000 dyn.s.cm -5 , (sub)segmental disease and advanced RV-failure, this led to a higher risk on postoperative pulmonary edema, pneumonia and hemodynamic instability, and resulted in an operative mortality >10% in historical case series. 137 , 138 , 139 , 140 , 141 Although a PVR >1,200 dyn.s.cm -5 out of proportion to the site and number of obstructions on imaging is still considered as higher risk with less predictable long-term outcome, recent case series report on excellent and comparable results of PEA in patients with PVR >1.000 dyn.s.cm -5 compared to patient with PVR <1,000 dyn.s.cm -5 . 22 , 137 , 141\n\nPatient selection remains though crucial to prevent, foresee or avoid postoperative complications related to high PVR. In patients with high PVR and minimal major vessel disease, microvascular disease is very likely and the threshold for surgery should be high. However, in patients with a certain amount of proximal, surgically accessible disease, the verification of microvascular disease and hence the risk on residual PH remains an unsolved diagnostic problem. Given their chances of a good outcome and their complete loss of quality of life, this last group of patients should be offered PEA, although at an increased risk for postoperative residual PH and reperfusion edema. Several advancements in the treatment of CTEPH patients in the last decade might have contributed to reduce the postoperative mortality in these high-risk patients.\n\nAdvancements in extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) technology, utilization and management is the single most important factor that has impacted the management of postoperative RV-failure from residual PH and reperfusion lung injury and of endobronchial bleeding. The largest experience described so far with post PEA ECMO is provided by the Papworth group, describing a 51.8% survival to hospital discharge with a satisfactory long-term survival. 142 Residual PH and reperfusion lung injury accounted for the majority of ECMO deaths between 2005 and 2022. 142 Interestingly, since 2014 the Toronto group applies a more liberal, early central venoarterial-ECMO strategy to manage difficulty weaning from CPB for 2 to 3 days after PEA. 141 They observed that PVR continued to improve for the first days after PEA, possibly due to resolution of pulmonary edema, reverse remodeling of pre- and post-capillary vasculopathy as well as improvement in left and right ventricular function. 141 , 143 Compared to the period before 2014, this strategy reduced their in-hospital mortality significantly from 31 to 4% for patients with preoperative decompensated right heart failure and from 10.3 to 1.6% for patients with PVR >1,000 dyn.s.cm -5 . 141 , 143\n\nGiven the association between high preoperative PVR and mortality post PEA, the use of PAH targeted medications as bridging therapy to optimize preoperative hemodynamics and to as such lower the operative risks and to improve postoperative outcome seems logical. However, pilot studies with bosentan or prostacyclin demonstrated improved pre-PEA hemodynamics, but no significant difference post-PEA compared to controls. 144 , 145 , 146 A study from the San Diego group indicated that bridging therapy was associated with delayed referral without clear benefits in outcomes. 147 The prospective European registry even suggested that bridging therapy, commonly used in patients with severe hemodynamic impairment, was an independent predictor of mortality. 20 Nonetheless, the use of riociguat as bridging therapy to PEA becomes increasingly prevalent. 148 This may be the result of some retrospective studies suggesting better outcomes with the use of PH targeted therapies as a bridge to PEA in patients with severe hemodynamic impairment. 149 , 150 A very recent retrospective study assessing the use of riociguat as bridging therapy to PEA, using matched patient cohorts, however failed to demonstrate benefits in postoperative mortality or hemodynamics. 151 There is as such currently little evidence to support the use of pulmonary vasodilator drugs in patients with operable CTEPH, even if they have a high preoperative PVR. This may only delay a potentially curative therapy. If physicians continue to commence vasodilator drugs at the time of investigation and before referral for consideration of surgery, the prospect of a RCT to answer the question remains minimal. 152\n\nPatients with an extensive amount of well-developed bronchial collaterals\n\nIn CTEPH, bronchial arteries supplying the pulmonary vascular bed distal to the obstructions will start to dilate in order to prevent local lung ischemia. 2 This well developed, bronchial collateral circulation can be visualized on a preoperative CT-scan. In addition to the possible development of capillary and post-capillary microvasculopathy, these hypertrophied bronchial arteries may also cause spontaneous massive hemoptysis requiring bronchial artery embolization before PEA. 153 , 154 , 155 The manipulation during PEA may also cause disruption of the planes and allow blood from large bronchial arteries into the airway, causing hemoptysis during or shortly after weaning from CPB. 2 , 156 , 157 Off note, the authors believe that in many cases the manipulation during PEA rather causes distal perforations of the PA branches itself and not always bronchial artery rupture, causing pulmonary hemorrhage. Several protocols have been developed describing how to handle these situations including the use of endobronchial blockers, PA plugging, switching from CPB to ECMO to allow heparin reversal with protamine and embolization of broncho-pulmonary collaterals. 157 , 158 , 159 , 160 , 161 ECMO in these scenarios can be lifesaving. 157 , 162 In patients in which ECMO was successfully used for this indication a good long-term survival is noted. 142\n\nThe lead author recently experienced a dramatic case in which a patient with massive bronchial collateral circulation visible on CT (see Figure 3 ) developed a massive right-sided hemothorax 2 days after PEA, needing cardiopulmonary resuscitation and massive blood product transfusion.\n\nAfter packing the right hemothorax with gauzes the bronchial collateral arteries were coiled by the interventional radiologist, followed by a right inferior lobectomy. Pathological examination confirmed bleeding from a capillary hemangioma in the lung parenchyma. (Case report in preparation). Although applying the appropriate venoarterial-ECMO strategy should make postoperative hemoptysis from collateral bronchial circulation reversible in the majority of cases, one may wonder, especially in the light of the aforementioned case, whether there is also a role for preventive measures? Kanchi et al. proposed in his algorithm to consider embolization of collaterals just prior to surgery in case of active hemoptysis. 158 If there might be a role for embolization of collaterals to prevent postoperative hemoptysis in high-risk patients seems largely unexplored, however it should be taken into consideration this might also cause lung infarction.\n\nPatients with seemingly unilateral disease\n\nAn important step in the work-up for unilateral PA involvement is differentiating it from other aetiologies, including pulmonary atresia, PA sarcoma, unitlateral PA agenesis, PA vasculitis or extrinsic compression of the PA from a mediastinal or hilar mass. 163 , 164 , 165\n\nOnce other etiologies are excluded or considered very unlikely, CTEPH patients with seemingly unilateral disease might be divided into 2 groups: (1) the ones with hypoperfusion, characterized by the typical vascular signs of CTEPH (abrupt tapering and truncation, webs and bands, occlusion of lobar/segmental/subsegmental branches, etc…) but limited to just one lung and (2) the ones with complete absence of perfusion in 1 or 2 lobes (see Figure 4 ) or even in the complete lung and with as such unilateral main PA occlusion. The latter seems to represent a patient cohort with distinct characteristics.\n\nUnilateral main PA occlusion is reported in 2.7–4.15% of PEA cases. 166 , 167 These patients are predominantly female and are younger with lower mPAP and PVR than patients with bilateral CTEPH. 166 , 167 Overall, PEA in this group results in marked hemodynamic and clinical improvement. 163 , 164 , 166 , 167 However, the arterial bed distal to the obstruction in these patients can develop severe post obstructive arteriopathy or be hypoplastic, leading to poor reperfusion despite adequate endarterectomy. 164 The combination of competitive flow from large broncho-pulmonary anastomoses and poor reperfusion is believed to cause the increased rates of rethrombosis seen after PEA in this group. 2 , 153 , 167 To decrease the risk of this rethrombosis, some surgeons advocate the use of an autologous or bovine pericardial patch during PA arteriotomy closure to widen the vessel lumen. 4 Others propagate to routinely perform immediate post-PEA bronchial embolization. 2 It is in any case recommended to perform PEA as soon as possible after diagnosis of unilateral main PA occlusion in order to prevent or minimize the development of distal microvasculopathy.\n\nDuring PEA, unilateral chronic thromboembolic pulmonary disease (CTEPD) without complete main PA occlusion is diagnosed in 3.7%, according to a recent multicenter study. 165 This group has similar patient profiles and PEA results as the unilateral main PA occlusion group. 165 However, given the absence of complete obstruction of the whole pulmonary vascular tree, in theory, the effects on the development and the consequences of secondary microvasculopathy might be different or at least less pronounced. Indeed, certain anatomic findings like hypoplastic PAs or small lung by chest radiograph were not described in this second group; nor was a description provided of the rate of rethrombosis or poor reperfusion. 165 The proposed strategies to decrease the risk of rethrombosis in the first group may therefore not be applicable to this second group.\n\nIn both groups, during PEA, it might be tempting to limit the surgical exploration to the affected side. However, imaging may not always reveal contralateral disease, although it is subsequently diagnosed and removed during PEA. 164 The San Diego group reported on contralateral disease is 48% of patients with unilateral main PA occlusion. 167 It is not clear in how many of these patients this was already diagnosed on preoperative imaging. From the series of Rashidi et al. we know that 3.9% of operated CTEPH patients effectively have unilateral disease, but in how many patients unilateral disease was suspected on imaging is not clear. 165 The diagnosis of CTEPD is however commonly missed on imaging and in the presence of obvious disease on one side, subtle signs on the other side may be missed. 168 We therefore strongly recommend to always inspect the contralateral PA during PEA, even if imaging indicates unilateral disease.\n\nPatient with chronic thromboembolic pulmonary disease without PH\n\nThe rationale to offer PEA to patients with CTEPD without PH at rest is to improve symptoms and exercise tolerance and hopefully, with early intervention, prevent the development of secondary microvasculopathy and RV failure. 169 However, CTEPD without PH not necessarily progresses to CTEPH and therefore not all these patients should be offered surgery. 170 Patients should be symptomatic, and the potential benefit of PEA should be further assessed by performing cardiopulmonary exercise testing and stress echocardiography or MRI to disclose impaired cardiac reserve and significant pulmonary vascular disease. 9 , 171 , 172 A mPAP/cardiac output slope > 3 Wood units (WU) between rest and exercise is used to define a pathological hemodynamic response of the pulmonary circulation, although the most correct methodology to define the mPAP/cardiac output ratio is debatable. 3 , 173 , 174 , 175 Several centers have indeed reported on excellent results of PEA in a selected, symptomatic cohort of operable CTEPD without PH. 169 , 176 , 177 , 178 In the only prospectively described cohort of such patients so far, operated patients had worse cardiopulmonary exercise parameters compared to nonoperated patients, and PEA resulted in hemodynamic, symptomatic and functional improvements. However, the majority of patients (82%) were not offered surgery. These patients remained symptomatic, but clinically and objectively stable. 170\n\nThe recent change in the definition of CTEPH from mPAP ≥ 25 mm Hg to mPAP ≥ 20 mm Hg and PVR ≥ 2 WU at rest has moreover seriously clouded the interpretation of the aforementioned reported good results because the characteristics of the patient group we are talking about now appear to have changed. 3 The Pavia group recently retrospectively compared CTEPD patients with a mPAP of 21–24 mm Hg with CTEPD patients with mPAP ≤ 20 mm Hg and PVR ≤ 2 WU and suggested that this new definition may discriminate CTEPD patient who may benefit from mechanical treatment of thromboembolic lesions. 179 Indeed, also in the prospectively assessed group of Papworth, none of the operated patients had a mPAP ≤ 20 mm Hg combined with a PVR ≤ 2 WU. 170 Whether this new definition with lower thresholds truly discriminates between patients that may or may not benefit from PEA warrants further research. Hence, other studies clearly demonstrate, despite a clear association between resting mPAP of 21–24 mm Hg with abnormal exercise hemodynamics, that even a significant number of patients with resting mPAP ≤ 20 mm Hg may have pulmonary vascular disease with a pathological hemodynamic response during exercise. 174 , 180 Moreover, it also does not implicate that all CTEPH patients with lower range mPAP (21–24 mm Hg) would benefit from PEA. The authors therefore clearly advise to continue considering the results of cardiopulmonary exercise testing and patient preferences in the decision-making process towards PEA for CTEPH patients with lower range mPAP.\n\nPEA and balloon pulmonary angioplasty: In which order or hybrid?\n\nPEA is the only potentially curative treatment and therefore remains the primary treatment of choice for technically operable patients who are good surgical candidates. 16 , 17 The most recent guidelines only recommend balloon pulmonary angioplasty (BPA) in patients who are technically inoperable or have residual PH after PEA. 3 Since the introduction of BPA and riociguat in the armamentarium of treatment options for CTEPH one decade ago, patient survival has indeed importantly improved. 17 For patients that are technically operable, but with a high proportion of distal disease and an unfavorable risk/benefit ratio for PEA, BPA may be considered (Class IIbC). 3 However, pulmonary haemodynamics and physical capacity show significantly less improvement if surgically accessible lesions are treated by BPA in patients not amenable for PEA, compared with BPA in patients that are technically inoperable. Nonetheless, the cumulative survival rates at 1, 5 and 10 years were not significantly different between these 2 groups. 181 , 182\n\nTreating CTEPH patients that are amenable to PEA with BPA is a lot more controversial because the opportunity for complete resection of the disease and the resulting better hemodynamic and functional results, is thereby potentially denied to the patient. 183 , 184 Hence, despite significant advancements in imaging, CTEPH may still remain unrecognized on imaging and the exact level of the disease may be underestimated. 12 , 168 Therefore, according to the authors, treating one lung with BPA and the other with PEA solely based on imaging findings is strongly contraindicated. Notwithstanding this advice, patients with certain risk profiles may form an exception. The group of Paris recently reported on the use of a sequential multimodal therapy in CTEPH patients with mixed anatomical lesions. 185 These patients had surgically accessible lesions present in one lung and surgically inaccessible lesions in the contralateral lung together with a PVR >800 dyn.s.cm -5 . Starting with PAH-targeted medical therapy in this specific patient group showed an improvement of pulmonary hemodynamics and the sequential add-on therapy with first BPA in one lung and PEA in the contralateral lung led to further improvement. However, generalizing the applicability of this strategy to all CTEPH patients would not be appropriate. Hence this specific patient population consisted of only 4.6% of the operable CTEPH patients. 185 Moreover, although medical therapy prior to BPA indeed seems to be beneficial, there is currently no convincing evidence that pre-PEA medical treatment has a positive impact on post-operative outcome in operable CTEPH patients. 20 , 147 , 186 Although the Paris group states that their multimodal approach does not exclude the option of inspecting the imaging assessed ‘‘non-operable’’ side during PEA, it was historically feared that the plane of the PEA dissection might deteriorate or become distorted during BPA, resulting in an impossible-to-correct dissection and in vascular injuries during PEA.\n\nIn this regard, the simultaneous combination of PEA and BPA, as described by Wiedenroth et al. seems more appropriate because after one-sided PEA, BPA was only performed after incision and inspection of the contralateral PA that confirmed the inoperability of that lung. 187 The German referral center reported their further experience with this hybrid approach at the 2021 International CTEPH Conference and stated, that complete surgical desobliteration was performed in 60% of all patients. This highlights that imaging often underestimates the intraoperative findings. Although it is not the same as simultaneous BPA during the rewarming phase of PEA, the Paris group reported that a strategy of rescue BPA after weaning from CPB, but often still supported by venoarterial-ECMO during the first postoperative days, may be at high risk or even dangerous, confirming that rescue BPA is futile. 188\n\nHowever, this reasoning seems to be refuted by the recent findings of Shimahara et al. who demonstrated that in a high-risk surgical patient group (operable disease but PVR >1,000 dyn.s.cm -5 ) BPA followed by PEA led to a decrease in mPAP and PVR as well as an increase in cardiac output before PEA. 189 Furthermore, compared with direct PEA, the combination of performing BPA before PEA was associated with a lower incidence of the early postoperative composite event (postoperative ECMO or intra-aortic balloon pump use, in-hospital death, rescue BPA, prolonged ventilation, tracheostomy, prolonged intensive care unit stay, deep sternal wound infection and cerebral infarction). 189 The Paris group reports on similar good results in more than 50 patients with this multimodal technique (unpublished, manuscript currently under review). Moreover, during PEA following BPA, the group from Tokyo did not identify any patient in whom adequate plane dissection was difficult or patients with vascular injuries, although PEA was performed for most lesions that were first treated with BPA. 189\n\nBased on the currently available literature, the authors still advocate for the majority of operable patients to only perform BPA in an, on imaging assessed, inoperable lung after visual inspection and confirmation of inoperability during a PEA procedure i.e., during or after the PEA procedure. We however acknowledge that for a small subset of operable patients, the ones with a high surgical risk (i.e., PVR >1,000 dyn.s.cm -5 ), a sequential multimodal therapy in which PEA is preceded by BPA +/- PAH-targeted medication might have its place, provided that always both left and right sided PA trees are inspected during the PEA procedure to clear out any removable disease. Such a strategy might not only improve outcomes of high-risk surgical patients but might in theory even reverse the risk/benefit ratio of technically operable patients deemed inoperable. However more research regarding this subject is needed in the upcoming years.\n\nReoperative pulmonary endarterectomy\n\nReoperative PEA is very rare, and small series have only been reported by high volume centers in which it constitutes between 0.7% and 1.5% of their experience. 190 , 191 , 192 , 193 Residual PH after PEA can often be explained by microvasculopathy, only amenable for treatment with medication. But not uncommonly, 2 other groups of CTEPH patients also present themselves with residual PH after PEA that should be considered for reoperative PEA: (1) patients with incomplete surgical clearance and (2) patients with true recurrent CTEPH.\n\nThe majority of patients within the first group previously underwent their primary PEA in another low-volume CTEPH center. 190 , 192 , 193 The San Diego group reported on an important number of patients that underwent unilateral PEA, despite the presence of bilateral disease, stressing again the importance of always inspecting both PAs during PEA. 192 In general, good PEA results are rightly attributed to the experience of an entire CTEPH team. This specific finding underscores however the importance of expertise on an individual surgeons’ level. Quantifying a minimal caseload for the individual surgeon based on center-reported data is almost impossible. 25 Based on expert opinion, however, an individual surgeon should perform >20 cases/year or >40 cases in 3 years. 194 This first group will probably become a smaller part of the number of patients that need to be reoperated in the future, since the much less risky BPA can now be used for residual lesions at segmental and subsegmental level. Through further centralization of care and with growing surgical expertise, it should even disappear completely. 191\n\nThe majority of patients in the second group had at least 1 recognized risk factor for the development of thromboembolic disease with coagulation disorders (especially antiphospholipid syndrome) and poor anticoagulation compliance as major predisposing factors. 190 , 191 , 192 These findings underscore the importance of a meticulous anticoagulation treatment post-PEA.\n\nIt should be emphasized that the results of reoperative PEA series only come from high-volume, high-expertise centers that applied a strict patient selection to limit the perioperative risks. Compared to primary PEA patients, reoperative PEA patients were younger and had rather proximal disease. Reoperative PEA results in a clear improvement of pulmonary hemodynamics, however not as significant as with primary surgery and in-hospital mortality rates are higher ranging between 7.7% and 40%. 190 , 191 , 192 , 193\n\nIn conclusion, reoperative PEA has acceptable results in experienced centers. The authors however plea for centralized treatment of CTEPH patients and meticulous postoperative anticoagulation treatment. Together with the availability of BPA and riociguat this will significantly reduce the need for reoperative PEA.\n\nPulmonary endarterectomy for other diseases\n\nConditions that may mimic CTEPH on imaging tests and all cause abnormal ventilation-perfusion scans are in situ thrombosis, pulmonary artery sarcoma (PAS) or other malignancies, fibrosing mediastinitis, pulmonary vein stenosis or occlusion, pulmonary vasculitis, sarcoidosis, anthracofibrosis, and PA congenital anomalies. All have however their distinct radiological features on CT to differentiate them from CTEPH. 195 , 196 Only for PAS and some other intraluminal PA malignancies a PEA can be considered.\n\nPrimary PAS are rare and often misdiagnosed on initial presentation for pulmonary embolism due to the patients’ symptoms of shortness of breath, PH, and RV-failure. This consequently leads to a delay in diagnosis, ineffective treatment with anticoagulation, or even attempted pulmonary thrombectomy with incomplete surgical resection. 197 , 198 , 199 , 200 Without surgical treatment, survival time may however be as low as 6 weeks. 201\n\nPEA and pneumonectomy are the 2 most commonly performed procedures. Complete surgical resection is indeed the preferred treatment, but achieving complete resection is challenging due to the often bilateral involvement of PAS and spreading along the pulmonary intima to the entire PA system. 202 The unique growth pattern of PAS, however, allows for the possibility of complete tumor removal with PEA. PEA can alleviate pulmonary embolism and PH while preserving the pulmonary vascular bed, thus offering PAS patients the opportunity for further treatment. 203 This is illustrated by the case of a 63-year-old lady in which a bilateral PAS was removed by PEA in September 2019 in Leuven by the lead author. Figure 5 shows the resected specimen. Six years later, the patient fully enjoys life and has no signs of tumor recurrence on CT-scan. Unfortunately, although each published study demonstrates significantly improved survival with surgery compared to without, median postoperative survival is poor and is reported to be between 17 and 24 months. 197 , 199 , 204 , 205 Next to distant metastases, each center describes a high prevalence of local recurrence as cause of death.\n\nAt present, it remains difficult to compare the efficacies of PEA vs pneumonectomy for managing PAS, not only because of the small number of cases of the disease, but also because of differences in preoperative conditions such as tumor location, tumor extension and preoperative cardiopulmonary function. 197 In case of exclusively unilateral disease, pneumonectomy might seem to guarantee complete resection, however others argue PAS is always bilateral or at least always exhibits bilateral seedings. 206 Therefore, most centers now only reserve pneumonectomy for patients whose tumors exhibited clear signs of distal invasion. 203 Although the surgical technique does not influence metastatic disease after surgical resection, local recurrence might be influenced. Based on the facts that PAS generally begins in the pulmonary root and that it expands the PA as it grows distally but does not penetrate the PA to involve mediastinal tissue outside the PA, the group of Houston recently described the results of their anatomic surgical resection and reconstruction approach. 207 The pulmonary root and main PAs are anatomically resected when involved with tumor. Distal to the first lobar branch, PEA is used if the lung can be salvaged and pneumonectomy if not. The pulmonary root is reconstructed using a pulmonary allograft. The main PAs are reconstructed with Dacron graft. Despite a small series of 20 patients, both the reported mortality and local recurrence rates appear to compare favorably with other published experiences. 207\n\nSeveral studies have reported longer overall survival when adjuvant postoperative chemo- and/or radiotherapy was used, especially by reducing distant metastasis without clear influence on local recurrence. 197 , 200 , 208\n\nIn summary, PEA emerges as a palliative but effective approach for managing PAS, particularly when complemented with adjuvant therapies. Based on the tumor location, anatomical resections and reconstructions of the pulmonary root, trunk and main PAs should be considered.\n\nAnecdotal reports have also been published about technical successful PEA for the resection of other primary PA tumors like a large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma and neurofibromatosis, and of metastatic thromboemboli, involving squamous cell carcinoma, osteosarcoma and intravascular leiomyomatosis. 203 , 209 , 210 , 211\n\nMinimal access PEA techniques\n\nIn the past 2 decades, the cardiothoracic community has witnessed continued evolution towards minimal-access surgery. The benefits of smaller incisions are thought to include decreased pain; improved respiratory mechanics; reductions in wound infections, bleeding, and need for transfusion; shorter intensive care unit stay; better cosmetics; and a quicker return to normal activity. 212 However, whether minimal-access surgery actually delivers these benefits is controversial. 212 , 213\n\nSo far only 3 groups have reported on 2 different minimal-access techniques for PEA. 74 , 87 , 88 , 214 The San Diego group has reported on excellent outcomes using bilateral mini-thoracotomies. 87 , 88 Cardioplegia administration was avoided but they adhered to the DHCA principles. However, eligible patients were a fairly selected group, as both PAs had to be well positioned in relation to the intercostal spaces used and obesity was considered a contraindication.\n\nThe Leuven group recently reported the safety and feasibility of an inverted-T upper hemisternotomy approach (See Figure 1 ), demonstrating similar long-term hemodynamic and functional results as well as a possible positive impact of Afib and intravenous opioid use. 74 The only absolute contraindications were the presence of an inferior caval vein filter and the need for certain concomitant cardiac surgeries. Compared to bilateral mini-thoracotomies this technique might be applicable to a larger subset of patients as chest anatomy was not considered a contraindication and certain concomitant procedures (i.e., PFO and left atrial appendage closure) are possible. It has in fact become the standard approach for PEA in Leuven with no need for conversion to full sternotomy in more than 40 consecutive cases so far (Tom Verbelen, personal communication). Although the hemisternotomy offers bilateral treatment using a single incision, bilateral thoracotomies might be considered as cosmetically superior because the midline is avoided. Moreover, in cases of unilateral disease a unilateral mini-thoracotomy might be very elegant, as pointed out by the Durham group. 214 But also, after prior cardiac surgery or when a non-ambulatory status prevents rehabilitation after sternotomy (bilateral) mini-thoracotomies may prove beneficial. 214\n\nHowever, both techniques seem to have been adopted so far predominantly in CTEPH patients with rather proximal disease. 74 , 88 No conclusion can be drawn regarding the surgical clearance of level IV disease based on the current available reports. Although small surgical scars and fast recovery times increase patient satisfaction in many other types of surgery, it should be emphasized that using minimal access cardiac surgical techniques should never be a goal per se. The goal should be to reduce invasiveness, intraoperative trauma, and bleeding and to accelerate postoperative recovery without compromising the quality, safety, and results of the conventional approach. 21 The current available literature indicates that both approaches have the potential to achieve these goals, but prospective RCTs will be needed to demonstrate this convincingly, although these can be challenging to set up. 215\n\nThe required surgical expertise\n\nThe technical operability of a CTEPH patient ultimately depends on both the anatomic location of the disease and the skill and experience of the surgeon. An experienced surgeon has been described as one that performs >20 cases/year or >40 cases in 3 years. 194 However, PEA is a complex procedure and a technical learning curve of approximately 125 procedures for each individual surgeon has been suggested before. 216 But it would be far too simplistic to attribute the success of a PEA program solely to the surgeon performing the procedure. Mortality is often determined by pathology specific complications like persistent PH causing RV-failure, reperfusion oedema, and pulmonary hemorrhage. The prevention of these complications requires a proper patient selection by a multidisciplinary team and the treatment of these complications requires perioperative management by experienced anesthesiologists, intensivists and rehabilitation staff. Furthermore, one can assume that once a surgeon has gone through the learning curve, further gains in his/her skill will be reflected less in hard endpoints such as mortality, but rather in e.g., the completeness of the resection and the absolute decrease in PVR. Taking into account the minimal required annual volume for the individual surgeon, it seems therefore more appropriate to define minimum required volumes and outcome parameters for PEA centers as a whole. An expert panel recently suggested that a PEA center should perform ≥20 surgeries/year with a post-operative mortality rate <5% and should have ECMO available. An expert PEA center was defined as one that performs ≥ 50 surgeries/year with mortality <3%, that can treat (sub)segmental disease and has ECMO support available. 12 Admittedly, as PEA programs worldwide are growing, as not all centers have reported on their latest experience and as reported mean annual volumes over larger time-periods may not reflect annual volumes of e.g., the last 5 years, the current annual case load of some centers may be underestimated. But based on the current published literature, only 4 centers in the world would meet this volume criterion of ≥ 50 surgeries/year with 30-day mortality <3%, which appears stringent. 162 , 217 , 218 , 219 These statements remain however expert opinions, they do not take into account the presence of right heart failure management experience (e.g., with heart or lung transplants), and also the guidelines do not provide a substantiated recommendation. 3 However, a very recent systematic review and meta-analysis, comprising the largest accumulation of consecutive patients undergoing PEA for CTEPH in literature so far quantified the volume-outcome association for this procedure, while objectively determining an annual case load of 33 PEA’s/year that can define a high-volume PEA center 25 (See Figure 6 ). According to this analysis both early mortality and long-term survival are significantly affected by procedural volume and subsequent expertise. Furthermore, patients operated in high volume centers confer an important survival benefit, with a number needed to treat to save a life at 10 years of only 7.7 in a high- vs low-volume center. 25 In addition to annual institutional volume, the excellence of outcome is important to consider as well. The previously suggested requirement of 5.0% mortality corresponds with a modeled case load of 40 cases/year according to this analysis. 25 Centralization can however not be pushed to an extreme, because then patients will have to travel excessive distances and the accessibility to CTEPH care may be compromised, especially in larger countries. This can in turn affect and aggravate socio-economic disparities. In contrast when criteria are too lenient, patients’ outcomes may be jeopardized. Keeping in mind the reported incidence and surgery rate of CTEPH, one high-volume specialized PEA center per 10–30 million inhabitants may eventually be justified. 25 , 220 , 221 Heuts et al. provided as such the first evidence-based recommendation for centralization of PEA surgery. Especially smaller countries, in which distances do not play a significant role, should therefore strongly be encouraged to limit their PEA expertise to a single center in order to optimize outcomes, while accessibility to CTEPH care within their own specific healthcare system remains guaranteed. On the other hand, also beyond the proposed threshold of 33–40 cases/year, a further significant and progressive decline in early mortality was noticed. 25 This provides rationale to also limit the experience of PEA surgery to a single center in densely populated areas with a population number well beyond 30 million.\n\nConclusions\n\nCTEPH requires referral to an expert center for final diagnosis and assessment of treatment possibilities by a multidisciplinary team. PEA is the only potentially curative therapy and therefore remains the treatment of choice. However, many practices and minor technical aspects of this procedure may still provoke controversy and well-founded recommendations can only be made for a few of them. Based on the most recent literature and the author’s own experiences and opinions, and in lack of clear guidelines, we strongly recommend (1) aortic cross clamping and cardioplegia in case of aortic valve insufficiency; (2) to avoid prolonged periods of rSO 2 <40% to minimize neurological complications; (3) to replace intravascular leads by epicardial ones; (4) left atrial appendage closure for atrial fibrillation; (5) to always inspect the contralateral pulmonary artery (PA), and (6) cardiopulmonary exercise testing in case of lower range PA pressures.\n\nWe consider (1) concomitant tricuspid annuloplasty for moderate-to-severe tricuspid valve insufficiency with an annular diameter ≥40 mm, if PEA is complete and without anticipated post-op persistent pulmonary hypertension; (2) to precede PEA by BPA +/- medication for selected high-risk patients, but if surgical disease is in proportion to the pulmonary vascular resistance, PEA should not be delayed for a trial of bridging medical therapy; (3) PEA for PA sarcomas as it is palliative but effective.\n\nWe advocate centralized CTEPH treatment and meticulous postoperative anticoagulation. Together with BPA and riociguat these will reduce reoperative PEA, which has acceptable results in experienced centers.\n\nFinancial support\n\nThis research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public, commercial, or not-for-profit sectors.\n\nDeclaration of Competing Interest\n\nThe authors declare the following financial interests/personal relationships which may be considered as potential competing interests: Tom Verbelen reports a relationship with Janssen-Cilag NV, a Johnson & Johnson company that includes: speaking and lecture fees.
