Studies have shown the advantage of McCoy and Truview laryngoscopes over Macintosh laryngoscopes in the immobilized cervical spine.[ 1 2 ] The McCoy laryngoscope has a hinged tip which helps to lift the epiglottis[ 3 ] and it is commonly used for tracheal intubation where visualization could be difficult.[ 4 ] The Truview (Truphatek International Ltd, Netanya, Israel) is a modified laryngoscope where the angular view of the larynx and adjacent structures is expanded by using an optical system view tube which consists of prisms and lenses.[ 5 6 ] However, the relative efficacy of these devices for bougie-aided NTI has not been evaluated. Bougie-aided NTI reduces the use of Magill forceps along with the incidence and severity of nasopharyngeal trauma.[ 7 ] We have planned this randomized, prospective study to compare the McCoy, Macintosh, and Tru-view laryngoscopes with respect to intubation time, success rate, and hemodynamic variations during bougie-aided NTI.\n\nMETHODS\n\nFollowing approval by the institutional ethics committee, a prospective randomized trial was performed in patients undergoing NTI for elective head and neck surgery. Forty-five adult American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) grade I-II patients undergoing elective oral surgery under general anesthesia requiring NTI were enrolled. Written informed consent (including consent to participate and publish) was taken from all the patients. Patients of either sex aged 18–60 years, ASA grade I-II, undergoing elective head and neck surgeries under general anesthesia with NTI were included in this study. Both simple and difficult airways (Mallampati grading 1–4) were included in view of bougie-aided intubations. ASA III/IV, restricted mouth opening, and body mass index >30 were excluded from the study. They were randomly assigned to three groups based on the device used for laryngoscopy by using a computer-generated random code. The allocation ratio was 1:1 and the patient, the person who collected data along with the person who did the analysis were blinded. The random allocation sequence was generated by the person who was not part of the study and concealment was done by using sequentially numbered, opaque, sealed envelopes (SNOSE technique). The participants were enrolled by the anesthesiologist taking care of the patient at the time of preanesthetic check-up. Assignment of the participants to the intervention was done according to the SNOSE codes which were opened in the preoperative area by the anesthesiologist posted in the theatre.\n\nIn group 1 patients McCoy laryngoscope, in group 2 Macintosh, and in group 3 Truview laryngoscope was used. Standard fasting guidelines were followed and all the patients received oral alprazolam 0.25 mg at night before surgery. Standard monitors were attached and oxymetazoline drops were used for the nostrils. The patient was kept in the “sniffing” position by placing a pillow under the head of the patient. Following preoxygenation for 3 min, all patients were given intravenous midazolam (0.04 mg/kg) and morphine (0.1 mg/kg). Induction of anesthesia was achieved using propofol (1–2 mg/kg). After checking the adequacy of mask ventilation, vecuronium bromide (0.1 mg/kg) was given. A well-lubricated ETT was inserted along the floor of the nasal cavity, directed straight back toward the occiput along with the nasal floor. Once the tube crossed the nasopharynx, the gum elastic bougie was introduced through it followed by using the laryngoscope to visualize the vocal cords, endotracheal tube, and tip of the bougie. The bougie was directed toward the larynx to cross the vocal cords and the ETT was threaded over it under vision along with oxygenation of the patient.[ 8 ] Laryngoscopy was performed with McCoy, Macintosh, or Truview laryngoscopes, and the best glottic view was recorded using the Cormack-Lehane (CL) grading (Grade 1–4; Grade 1: complete glottis visible, Grade 2: anterior glottis not seen, Grade 3: epiglottis seen but not glottis, Grade 4: epiglottis not seen).[ 9 ] Oxygen at a flow rate of 6 L/min was connected to the TruView blade to prevent fogging. The endotracheal cuffed tube of size 6.5 and 7.5-mm internal diameter was used for female and male patients, respectively, which was advanced into the trachea under direct vision. The scope was taken out and the respiratory circuit was connected. The tube position was confirmed by chest auscultation and capnography traces.\n\nRemoval of the laryngoscope from the mouth was counted as an extra attempt for intubation.\n\nChange in the position of the patient’s head during intubation was allowed. If the first intubation attempt failed, a next attempt was done after mask ventilation for a few minutes. In each group, tracheal intubation was considered a failure if it could not be accomplished in three attempts and it was excluded from the study. All intubations were performed by an anesthesiologist with more than 5 years of experience (well-versed with all the laryngoscopes). If the third attempt was still unsuccessful, the fiberoptic bronchoscope (FOB) was applied. If intubation was not possible with FOB, the patient was awakened. None of the patients needed fiberoptic intubation/awakening. We adhered to the protocol and there were no changes in the trial outcomes after the trial commenced. It was per protocol analysis.\n\nSample size\n\nBharti et al .[ 2 ] compared intubation time of Macintosh, McCoy, and Truview laryngoscope. Taking into consideration their result, we calculated an effect size of 1.34. Considering the effect size with 80% of power at an alpha value of 0.05, the required sample in each group was 12. We increased the sample to 15 in each group to increase the power of the study and compensate for dropouts or missing data. The sample size was calculated using G-power software version 3.0 (G power 3; Institut für Psychologie, Christian-Albrechts-Universität Kiel, Kiel, Germany).\n\nThe primary objective was to compare the intubation time taken (insertion of ETT in nostril to capnograph visualization) by using these three laryngoscopes, while the secondary objective was to compare the number of attempts, Cormack and Lehane grade, need for external laryngeal manipulation, first pass success and hemodynamic response (5 min before intubation, during procedure, and 5 min after intubation).\n\nStatistical analysis\n\nStatistical analysis was performed using SPSS version 27 (IBM corporation, Armonk, New York, USA). Categorical variables are expressed as frequency or percentages and compared by Chi-square test. The data were analyzed for normality by using the Shapiro–Wilks test. Since variables were normally distributed, we expressed values in mean and standard deviation (SD). One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) test was used to compare numerical variables between the three groups. Within group, a comparison of parameters was carried out using repeated measures ANOVA, and group interaction was also calculated. A P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.\n\nRESULTS\n\nThe study outline showed in the consort flow diagram [ Figure 1 ]. The comparison of baseline characteristics of the study participants between the groups is shown in Table 1 ]. Truview group had a higher percentage of patients with less than adequate mouth opening compared to other groups ( P = 0.034). The comparison of different intubation parameters between the groups is shown in Table 2 . CL Grade 1 was obtained more in truview group (53.3%) compared to the other two groups. CL Grade 3 was obtained in 20% each in McCoy and Macintosh groups, but no patient in Tru-view group had CL Grade 3. Truview group had the shortest duration of intubation compared to the other two groups ( P = 0.48). Figure 2 shows a boxplot depicting the comparative duration of intubation in the three groups. Although Truview group had a higher percentage of first-attempt intubation (93.3%) compared to McCoy (80%) and Macintosh (86.7%), they were comparable for first-attempt intubation ( P = 0.86). Table 3 depicts heart rate (HR) and blood pressure variation in the group and among the groups. Truview group had a higher median HR during intubation than the other groups. Although the Truview blade had a higher HR compared to other groups after intubation, the result was not significant ( P = 0.47). The difference in mean arterial pressure between all three groups before, during, and after intubation was not significant ( P = 0.95, 0.79, and 0.88, respectively).\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nAlthough many studies are there comparing different laryngoscopes for NTI,[ 10 11 12 13 ] here we are comparing these three laryngoscopes for the first time using bougie-guided NTI. Time of intubation for McCoy, Macintosh, and Truview is expressed as (mean ± SD) and came out to be 86.87 ± 15.92, 82.87 ± 16.46, 79.93 ± 14.53 s, respectively; which was comparable ( P = 0.48). Truview has more CL grade 1 and no CL grade 3. Mean blood pressure and HR variations were comparable between the three groups although the Truview group had higher HR variations. We did not find any significant difference in the external laryngeal manipulations, number of attempts, and use of the Magill forceps among the three groups.\n\nThe shortest time for intubation with the Truview laryngoscope may be attributed to the shorter laryngoscopy and visualization of the glottic opening. We need not to align all the axes during the laryngoscopy by video-laryngoscopes (VLs) and only wrist movement can help to visualize glottic opening.[ 14 15 ]\n\nZhu et al . have compared King Vision, McGrath MAC VL, and Macintosh in predicted difficult intubations and they found both the VLs comparable and better in performance as compared with the Macintosh.[ 10 ] In our study, ETT was railroaded over the bougie which could be the factor responsible for the comparable time for all the laryngoscopes. We have taken the intubation time as the time from the introduction of the endotracheal tube through the nostril to the appearance of capnography trace. Intubation time was also defined differently in a few studies.[ 11 12 ] Both Raveendra et al . and Tseng et al . defined intubation time as starting from the removal of the face mask to the appearance of the capnography trace and a failed attempt for intubation time of more than 60 s.[ 11 12 ] We found more CL 1 grade (53.3%) with the use of the Truview laryngoscope which is similar to Mishra et al .[ 13 ] who have compared Truview with the King Vision laryngoscope. Unlike Bag et al .[ 16 ] there were no significant variations in the HR and mean blood pressure variations among the groups.\n\nKing et al .[ 17 ] found that VL used for NTI results in decreased intubation time and use of the Magill forceps as compared to direct laryngoscope. Similar findings of improved glottic visualization and reduced intubation time with C-MAC D-Blade VL as compared to McCoy laryngoscope for NTI were there in a simulated difficult airway.[ 18 ]\n\nChanging factors other than laryngoscopes may also affect various variables during laryngoscopy. Staar et al .[ 19 ] found no differences in rates of failed tracheal intubation by using conventional versus modified Magill’s forceps.\n\nLifting forces used for different laryngoscopes for a glottic view are different and it is less with the VLs as compared to other laryngoscopes but there is a difference in manipulations needed to pass ETT after visualization and to pass gum elastic bougie. We passed bougie first and ETT was railroaded over it which could be the reason for lesser manipulations and lesser hemodynamic responses. That could also be the reason for the comparable use of Magill’s forceps among the groups.\n\nLimitations of our study include the absence of blinding and uniformity of the person doing the procedure, although all the anesthesiologists were experienced and well versed with the techniques. Postoperative complications also were not included in the objectives.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nMcCoy, Macintosh, and Truview laryngoscopes were comparable in performance during bougie-aided NTI with Truview having the shortest intubation time and better visualization.\n\nResearch quality and ethics statement\n\nThis study was approved by the Institutional Review Board/Institutional Ethics Committee at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Bhubaneswar (Approval #: T/IM-NF/Anaest/17/09; Approval date September 5, 2017).
