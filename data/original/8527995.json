  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: There are limited data on outcomes of extracranial-intracranial (EC-IC)\nbypass in patients with recurrent hemispheric syndromes due to\natherosclerotic internal carotid artery occlusion (AICAO).\n\nOBJECTIVE: To compare clinical outcomes and efficacy of EC-IC bypass surgery in patients\nwith and without recurrent hemispheric syndromes associated with AICAO in\nthe Carotid Occlusion Surgery Study (COSS).\n\nMETHODS: In patients enrolled in the COSS trial, we compared baseline characteristics\nand clinical outcomes for participants with (rHEMI+) and without\nrecurrent hemispheric ischemia (rHEMI−) prior to randomization into\nsurgical vs medical groups. The primary outcome was all stroke and death\nfrom randomization through 30 d and ipsilateral ischemic stroke within 2\nyr.\n\nRESULTS: Of 195 randomized participants, 100 were rHEMI+ (50 in each group).\nBaseline characteristics between rHEMI+ and rHEMI−\nparticipants were similar except rHEMI+ were more likely to have had\nprevious stroke prior to randomization (61% vs 20%, P < .01) and to have TIA as the\nentry event (59% vs 21%, P < .01). All primary endpoints were\nipsilateral ischemic strokes. There were no significant differences in\noccurrence of the primary endpoint between nonsurgical and surgical\nparticipants in rHEMI+ (26.3% vs 22.4%, P = .660) and rHEMI−\n(18.9% vs 19.5%, P = .943). For nonsurgical\nparticipants, there was no significant difference in the primary endpoint\nfor rHEMI+ vs rHEMI− patients\n( P = .410)\n\nCONCLUSION: Patients with recurrent hemispheric stroke syndromes enrolled in the COSS\ntrial did not show benefit from EC-IC bypass compared to medical treatment.\nEarly aggressive risk factor measures should be prioritized to reduce\nrecurrent strokes in these patients.",
