Annually, 398 000 people sustain fire- or burn-related injuries along with 252 000 contact burns, resulting in approximately 29 165 hospitalizations and 800 inpatient deaths in the United States. 1 Despite a lack of novel burn treatment advances, survival in burn patients has gradually improved. 2 The economic burden is similarly substantial with treatment-associated costs estimated to exceed $1 billion, not including disability or rehabilitation indirect expenditures. 1\n\nDistributive shock, which often occurs in the setting of burn injury, is the most common form of shock in critically ill patients and is broadly characterized by systemic vasodilation, capillary leak, and altered oxygen extraction leading to hypoperfusion in the setting of normal or high cardiac output. 3 In severe burn injury, the complex thromboinflammatory, immune, metabolic, and cardiovascular response often results in an initial hypovolemic or mixed shock. 4 This burn shock begins within ~72 hours (referred to as the ebb phase) of injury and is characterized by profound capillary permeability, reduced cardiac preload, increased systemic vascular resistance (SVR), and direct myocardial depression. The degree of vasoplegia is less certain, but has been described, especially in elderly patients following severe burn injury. 5 The subsequent flow phase is characterized by improved cardiac output, reduced SVR, and hypermetabolism that may persist for years after burn injury. Additionally, the physiologic response to severe burn injury, shock, and disrupted skin barrier places patients at risk of concurrent or subsequent septic shock, a primarily distributive shock. 6 The most common reason for death for patients surviving the initial resuscitative period is sepsis. 7 Specifically, over 50% of deaths in modern burn units have been attributed to septic shock or multi-organ dysfunction syndrome. 8 , 9 Recent reviews and guidelines have addressed the initial resuscitation and management of burn shock, highlighted its complexity, and emphasized an appreciation for the individual or combined contributions of numerous shock types and pathophysiologic processes. 4 , 10\n\nHemodynamic support of severely burned patients remains challenging. The above-mentioned pathophysiology, combined with treatment-related factors and medications (eg, analgesics and sedatives), may further confound and contribute to hypotension. The American Burn Association (ABA) guidelines provide recommendations surrounding acute fluid resuscitation in severely burn-injured adults, which will not be the focus of this review. Instead, it will discuss the utilization of vasoactive agents in severe burn-injured patients experiencing hypotension, despite appropriate fluid resuscitation, during acute burn shock resuscitation (refractory burn shock) and septic shock. Contemporary clinical practice guidelines provide no or limited recommendations on the role of vasoactive agents in these settings. 7 , 11–13 However, the aforementioned ABA guidelines, utilizing a PICO-guided strategy, asked a needed question, but were unable to make a recommendation regarding which vasopressor should be initiated as first-line therapy. 14 In this narrative review, an overview of vasoactive agents is followed by an evaluation of the potential role of synthetic angiotensin-II (AT-II) as a novel vasoactive agent in severe burn injury-associated shock.\n\nVASOACTIVE AGENTS IN SHOCK AND SEVERE BURN INJURY\n\nVasoactive agents are utilized in various types of shock to attenuate derangements in organ perfusion and oxygenation. They are broadly categorized into catecholamines and non-catecholamines and exhibit unique hemodynamic, physiologic, and adverse effects via stimulation of adrenergic and non-adrenergic receptors, respectively ( Table 1 ). 15 Several fundamental principles and clinical findings are considered to aid in vasoactive agent selection. First, clinicians must appreciate the complex neurohormonal interplay among the adrenergic, vasopressin, and renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) that is central to hemodynamic homeostasis. 15 Potential impairments and/or deficiencies within these systems may offer potential therapeutic targets in managing shock syndromes when vasoactive agents are necessary. 16 In the setting of cardiogenic shock, for example, the use of vasoactive agents with inotropic properties is often considered. 17–19 Differences in clinical outcomes between vasoactive agents in cardiogenic shock are sparse; however, norepinephrine (NE) has been suggested as the vasopressor of choice, owing to its improved arrhythmogenic, hemodynamic, and metabolic profile compared with dopamine and epinephrine, respectively. 18 , 20–24 Additionally, consideration of vasoactive agents with less vasoconstrictive effects on the pulmonary vasculature has been advocated for in cardiogenic shock patients with right ventricular failure. In patients with septic shock, NE was strongly recommended by the 2021 Surviving Sepsis Campaign (SSC) guidelines as the preferred first-line vasopressor. 25 Safety data and meta-analyses represent high-quality evidence supporting the use of NE over dopamine. 5 , 20 , 26 While strong recommendations for the use of first-line NE in favor of epinephrine and non-catecholamines (eg, vasopressin, selepressin, and synthetic AT-II) were made, they were supported by very low-to-moderate quality evidence. In septic shock patients not achieving mean arterial pressure (MAP) targets despite increasing doses of NE, a weak suggestion based on moderate quality evidence was made for the addition of vasopressin. Vasopressin analogs, terlipressin and selepressin, were not suggested for use in septic shock patients due to safety findings and lack of commercial availability, respectively. A weak suggestion based on low-quality evidence was provided for the addition of epinephrine as the third-line vasoactive agent in septic shock patients with inadequate MAP despite NE and vasopressin. Finally, in the absence of clinical experience and high-quality data, synthetic AT-II was not recommended as a first-line agent for septic shock in the 2021 SSC guidelines.\n\nDespite the availability of and experience with catecholamines and vasopressin, 62% of critically ill patients receiving one or more of these vasoactive agents experience MAP below 65 mmHg for ≥2 hours. 27 Moreover, higher doses and overall exposure to catecholamines and vasopressin are associated with higher odds of intensive care unit (ICU) mortality and adverse effects. 27–31 Finally, non-response to vasoactive agents is common and associated with negative outcomes. For example, 2 recent cohort studies described an identical rate of response (45%) to vasopressin in septic shock patients. 32 , 33 Non-response to vasopressin was associated with a higher incidence of in-hospital mortality in both studies. Recently, a multicenter cohort study observed an incidence of hemodynamic response to synthetic AT-II of 67% and a significantly higher 30-day survival compared with non-responders (41% vs. 25%, P = .001). 34 These and other data have stimulated investigations into clinical, physiologic, and genetic characteristics that may affect vasoactive agent selection and response. 32–39 Indeed, advocacy and commentary have emerged for personalized or multimodal approaches to minimize vasoactive agent exposure, optimize time to target hemodynamic parameters, and allow identification of responders/non-responders to specific therapies. 40–46\n\nThe 2023 ABA guidelines provided no recommendations on vasoactive selection in acute burn resuscitation due to a paucity of data but highlighted descriptions of NE and vasopressin in burn patients to augment blood pressure and limit fluid resuscitation. 14 Indeed, studies of acute burn resuscitation have described catecholamines as the most common vasoactive agents in this setting. 5 , 47–49 In severe burn injury, release of endogenous catecholamines and other stress hormones results in numerous physiologic changes, including but not limited to peripheral insulin resistance, protein loss, muscle wasting, sustained release of pro-inflammatory mediators and suppression of macrophage antigen presentation, neutrophil killing, and T-cell proliferation. 4 , 50–58 The resultant state of hypermetabolism, immune dysregulation, and inflammation in burn injury is profound and sustained, partially due to the excessive endogenous catecholamine surge. 59–61 Early administration of exogenous catecholamines in burn patients has been associated with deleterious events. The use of NE during the first 48 hours of burn resuscitation was associated with decreased skin graft take, increased graft failure rates as well as an increased number of subsequent surgical operations in managing skin graft failures. 62 An animal model also demonstrated that epinephrine may further exacerbate burn tissue necrosis. 63 Exogenous NE administration has been shown to dysregulate the immune response in sepsis. 64 , 65 Finally, stimulation of adrenergic receptors via catecholamines is known to cause cardiac toxicity via myocyte apoptosis and necrosis. 66–69 While increased understanding of catecholamines’ contribution to severe burn injury pathogenesis may rationalize limiting exogenous exposure, they (eg, NE) largely remain the standard of care in acute burn resuscitation when vasopressor support is required, although high-quality outcome data are lacking. Similarly, clinical outcome data remain elusive surrounding the use of vasopressin in acute burn shock. 70 Evans et al. demonstrated that severe burn injuries altered responsiveness to vasoactive agents when comparing differences in MAP response to vasopressin and phenylephrine in burn-injured and resuscitated rats to sham controls. 71 A 2-fold reduction in potency of phenylephrine to increase MAP was observed in the initial 24 hours post-burn, while vasopressin’s potency increased as high as 3-fold.\n\nIn burn-injured patients who develop septic shock, the Surviving Sepsis After Burn Campaign (SSABC) provided a best practice statement of NE as the first-line vasopressor. 7 In the absence of burn-specific data, this statement was rationalized by the 2021 SSC guidelines recommendation. 25 Unfortunately, no agreement was made surrounding the selection of a second-line vasopressor (vasopressin or epinephrine) by the SSABC. 7 Cartotto et al. described the use of exogenous vasopressin added to concurrent NE in a cohort of septic burn patients. 72 When added to concurrent NE, exogenous vasopressin was associated with a significant increase in MAP and NE-sparing effects. Although these data may accentuate the rationale for catecholamine avoidance in severe burn-injured patients with septic shock and highlight the potential for non-catecholamines in this setting, complications were common with vasopressin and included peripheral ischemia, skin graft failure, gastrointestinal necrosis, and donor site conversion. Additional and higher-quality data exploring the role of vasopressin in the setting of burn injury are warranted.\n\nSynthetic AT-II is the most recently approved non-catecholamine vasoactive agent. Its mechanism of action targets the third physiologic system integral to hemodynamic homeostasis, the RAAS. Elucidation of additional non-catecholamine vasoactive agents is warranted, given the potentially deleterious role of exogenous catecholamine administration in burn shock, where an excess of catecholamines may preexist, and the noted limitations of vasopressin. The remainder of this article focuses on the potential of synthetic AT-II as a novel, non-catecholamine vasoactive agent in the setting of severe burn injury and data gaps associated with its use.\n\nOVERVIEW OF THE RAAS\n\nThe systemic RAAS is an integral component of arterial blood pressure regulation and consists of a dynamic interplay between “classical” and “alternative” pathways ( Figure 1 ). 73 , 74 Of note, the local renin-angiotensin system (RAS) refers to tissue-based mechanisms of this system that may operate independently of the systemic RAAS.\n\nClassical RAAS pathway\n\nBroadly, the classical RAAS pathway involves renin, primarily produced and released from the kidney, converting angiotensinogen, a substrate predominantly synthesized by the liver, to angiotensin-I (Ang-I). Subsequently, hydrolysis of Ang-I to active angiotensin-II (Ang-II) occurs via angiotensin-converting enzyme type 1 (ACE1), largely in the pulmonary and renal vasculature. Resultant Ang-II binds to angiotensin type 1 receptors (AT1R) inducing systemic vasoconstriction. Stimulation of AT1R may also result in pro-inflammatory and profibrotic effects, as well as aldosterone secretion. 75 Angiotensin type 1 receptors are present in numerous tissues, including the heart, vasculature, kidney, adrenal glands, and pituitary. Additional physiologic effects of Ang-II include stimulation of the sympathetic nervous system and vasopressin release.\n\nAlternative RAAS pathway\n\nKey components of the alternative RAAS pathway, including angiotensin 1-7 (Ang 1-7), angiotensin 1-9 (Ang 1-9), and alamandine, are known to have counter-regulatory vasodilatory properties ( Figure 1 ). Activation of the alternative pathway occurs via metabolism of Ang-I and Ang-II by enzymes including ACE type 2, neutral endopeptidase, and prolyl-endopeptidase. The binding of alternative pathway effector molecules (Ang 1-9) and (Ang 1-7) to angiotensin type 2 receptors (AT2R), Mas receptors, and/or MrgD receptors results in anti-inflammatory, anti-fibrotic, anti-natriuretic and vasodilatory effects. As such, inhibition or overactivity of this pathway has become implicated in blood pressure regulation. Notably, AT2R receptors are expressed in the heart, kidney, adrenal glands, and brain but have low expression compared with AT1R. These data reiterate the complexity of the RAAS and complement a growing understanding of its components and necessary balance in various physiologic states.\n\nIMPLICATIONS OF RAAS DYSREGULATION\n\nAcute organ dysfunction and/or disease pathogenesis may contribute to RAAS dysregulation in the setting of critical illness. Clinicians must recognize that acute organ (eg, liver, lung, and kidney) damage may negatively impact normal RAAS physiologic effects. These may include reduced ACE activity, lower endogenous Ang-II serum concentrations, elevated serum renin concentrations, diminished AT1R response to endogenous Ang-II, and increased circulating levels of vasodilatory angiotensin metabolites. 36 , 76–80 Moreover, hyperreninemia has become recognized as a marker of RAAS dysregulation with Ang-II deficiency and is associated with poor outcomes. 81 Observational data from patients undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) surgery have indicated a higher incidence of acute kidney injury (AKI) and vasoplegic syndrome among patients with elevated renin concentration/activity. 82–84 In distributive shock patients from the phase 3, randomized, placebo-controlled Angiotensin-II for Treatment of High Output Shock (ATHOS)-3 trial, elevated renin above the study median was associated with an increased odds of 28-day mortality. 36 Renin kinetics have also outperformed classically utilized markers (eg, lactate concentration) in predicting in-hospital mortality in distributive shock patients. 77 , 85 Finally, elevations of dipeptidyl-peptidase 3 (DPP3), a metallopeptidase that cleaves Ang-II without acting on Ang-I, have been described in septic shock and are associated with organ dysfunction, need for vasoactive agents, and mortality. 86–90\n\nElevations of renin activity in burn patients are well described, although associations with clinical outcomes are lacking. 91–94 In 1971, Bozovic et al. observed plasma renin activity to be significantly elevated in burn patients on days 1-4. While this activity normalized in subsequent days, significant elevations were re-observed 5 days pre-mortem. 91 Recently, Vieweg et al. observed significantly elevated renin levels without derangement of traditional markers of resuscitation (eg, lactate, MAP, and urinary output) in burn patients resuscitated using the Parkland formula. 95 The authors postulated that these observations may suggest a relative renal hypoperfusion in patients with severe burns among other possible mechanisms. Furthermore, PRONOBURN investigators observed significant associations with elevated DPP3 levels and mortality, circulatory failure, and AKI, and highlighted the potential of alternative hemodynamic strategies, such as synthetic AT-II. 96 , 97 In ongoing work, investigations by a member of the author team are finding that hyperreninemia persists for greater than 200 hours post-injury. Moreover, they are finding that patients who die have higher renin levels than those who survive, and this is observed as early as hour 2 post injury (Unpublished data—[Shupp et al.]). In the setting of wound healing and/or burn injury, components of the local RAS are disrupted. Steckelings et al. and Murphy et al. reported upregulation of AT1R and AT2R in skin injury, while Kurosaka et al. described the involvement of AT1R in re-epithelialization. 98–100 More recently, Akershoek et al. described the presence of various RAS components in human burn wounds and scars at various time points. Related findings in the setting of radiation plus burn injury support that cutaneous RAS disruption may contribute to delayed wound healing. 101\n\nPOTENTIAL BENEFITS OF AT-II IN BURN PATIENTS\n\nIn the presence of vasoplegia or vasodilation, exogenous administration of synthetic AT-II could be postulated to improve tissue perfusion and offer a fluid-reducing strategy via its mechanism of action that includes increased aldosterone release, activation of the vasopressin system, and direct vasoconstriction of the venous and arterial vasculature. 102 In septic AKI, intraglomerular hypotension induced by efferent arteriole vasodilation may be improved by synthetic AT-II administration, leading to restoration of creatinine clearance and urine output (UOP). 103 It has been proposed that the improved filtration fraction seen after AT-II administration during sepsis results from having a greater effect on efferent than afferent arterioles, which is in contrast to NE that has been shown to affect afferent and efferent arterioles similarly. 103\n\nEarly and sustained endogenous catecholamine excess, other pathophysiologic processes (eg, adrenergic receptor downregulation), and/or tachyphylaxis may result in a variable hemodynamic and/or dose response to exogenous catecholamines. Moreover, given the complications associated with catecholamine excess, it may be postulated that limiting exposure to exogenous catecholamines through the use of synthetic AT-II may result in improved efficacy and/or safety outcomes in both acute burn and septic shock; however, these data are currently lacking. The exclusion of patients with over 20% total body surface area (TBSA) burns in ATHOS-3 negates direct generalizability to severe burn injury; however, the incidence of MAP response of 70% in a median of 5 minutes in severe, refractory shock patients receiving synthetic AT-II is noteworthy. 104 The catecholamine-sparing effects of synthetic AT-II in distributive shock are well documented, and hemodynamic response has been associated with improved outcomes. 34 , 104 , 105 Furthermore, recent animal and clinical data have observed a lower incidence of cardiac toxicity and arrhythmias with AT-II use compared with catecholamines. 106 , 107 Finally, laboratory-based data have observed improved immune response and bacterial clearance with AT-II administration compared with catecholamines in a murine sepsis model, providing another potential benefit in patients at high risk of infection. 108\n\nA final potential benefit of synthetic AT-II in the setting of burn injury surrounds the promotion of wound healing and tissue generation. Data describing cutaneous local RAS disruption have led to the study of AT-II as a contributor to cutaneous wound healing. 109–113 Furthermore, Rodgers et al. and Takeda et al. described the importance of AT1R and AT2R balance in the setting of in vivo dermal tissue repair. 111 , 114 In a subsequent series of studies, Rodgers et al. observed that topical administration of AT-II and Ang (1-7) improved wound repair and increased keratinocyte and epidermal stem cell proliferation and the rate of epithelialization. 109 While encouraging, these data must be weighed against the known contributions of AT1R stimulation to fibrosis and scar formation, and in the context of preliminary/animal data exploring the effects of RAAS inhibition in burn-related disorders and processes, including the skin, insulin sensitivity, anti-inflammation, cardiopulmonary protection, and brain apoptosis. 115–119 Given the host of actions caused by stimulation of the AT1R and AT2R, the impact of exogenously administered AT-II on related clinical sequelae remains unknown.\n\nCLINICAL STUDIES AND EVIDENCE\n\nTo the best of our knowledge, no clinical studies have evaluated the effect of synthetic AT-II in shock syndromes following severe burn injury. The exclusion of patients with ≥20% TBSA in the ATHOS-3 trial is noteworthy and consistent with other distributive shock trials. 104 As a result, burn providers must interpret the totality of both clinical and non-clinical data to inform the current role and/or future potential of AT-II in the setting of severe burn injury.\n\nIn the United States, synthetic AT-II was approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 2017 as a vasoconstrictor to increase blood pressure in adults with septic or other distributive shock. The approval of synthetic AT-II was based on the results of a short-term pilot study and a subsequent phase III, randomized, double-blind, and placebo-controlled trial. 104 , 120 In the pilot intravenous (IV) ATHOS trial, 20 patients were randomized to receive synthetic AT-II or placebo, most often in conjunction with NE and vasopressin. Patients who received synthetic AT-II had a lower, non-statistically significant NE dose throughout the study period. Furthermore, at hours 0-8 following synthetic AT-II or placebo initiation, synthetic AT-II patients had numerically higher mean UOP. No adverse effects differed significantly between groups; however, investigators reported an incidence of hypertension of 20% in synthetic AT-II patients compared with 0% in placebo-treated patients. In ATHOS-3, patients in high-output, refractory shock requiring at least 0.2 µg/kg/min of NE-equivalents (NEE) were randomized to receive IV synthetic AT-II or placebo in conjunction with standard-of-care vasoactive agents. The primary endpoint of MAP response (MAP ≥75 mmHg or increase by 10 mmHg from baseline) at hour 3 was significantly greater in patients treated with synthetic AT-II compared with placebo (69.9% vs. 23.54%, P < .001). No statistically significant differences were found in exploratory outcomes of 7- and 28-day mortality. Statistically significant reductions in mean cardiovascular Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score change at hour 48 (−1.75 vs. −1.28, P = .01) and mean NEE dose at hour 3 (−0.03 vs. 0.03, P < .001) in AT-II treated patients highlighted the observed catecholamine-sparing properties of AT-II compared with traditional vasoactive agents. Serious adverse events and adverse events leading to discontinuation of study drug did not differ significantly between groups. The vasopressor-sparing properties of AT-II in the ATHOS and ATHOS-3 trials may be of interest to burn providers wishing to mitigate the potential downsides of commonly utilized vasoactive agents. Furthermore, the enrollment of mostly (~90%) septic shock patients in ATHOS-3 suggests that AT-II could be considered in late burn shock that is believed to be septic in nature.\n\nAs previously described, laboratory and clinical data have consistently observed RAAS dysregulation and associated it with poor clinical outcomes in distributive shock. 36 , 77 , 82–84 , 86–88 A post-hoc analysis of ATHOS-3 observed receipt of AT-II was associated with reduced 28-day mortality compared with standard-of-care vasoactive agents in patients with high renin shock (50.9% vs. 69.9%, P = .012). 36 Combined with the physiologic rationale, these data have led to several studies exploring the utility of synthetic AT-II in patients prone to RAAS dysregulation such as those with severe AKI requiring renal replacement therapy (AKI-RRT), acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and cardiac surgery requiring CPB. In the setting of severe AKI-RRT, receipt of AT-II was associated with improved 28-day survival (53% vs. 30%, P = .012) and higher incidence of RRT discontinuation at day 7 (38% vs. 15%, P = .007) compared with standard-of-care vasoactive agents. 121 Consistent findings of improved oxygenation indices were observed in a post-hoc analysis of ATHOS-3 patients with ARDS who received AT-II compared with standard-of-care vasoactive agents, as well as a multicenter observational study of distributive shock patients. 122 , 123 In 16 post-CPB patients in ATHOS-3, MAP response at hour 3 was significantly higher in patients treated with AT-II compared with standard-of-care vasoactive agents (89% vs. 0%, P < .001) and the median percent change in NEE dose at hour 12 was significantly lower (−76.5% vs. 7.8%, P = .001). 124 The findings and observations of these studies in cohorts with known or likely RAAS dysregulation highlight the growing aspirations of precision medicine in the ICU. The involvement of the RAAS in the setting of burn injury, as well as the frequency of AKI-RRT and ARDS, may provide further rationale for AT-II consideration in burn-injured patients.\n\nPublished real-world data of synthetic AT-II showcase that it has often been utilized as salvage therapy in clinically moribund patients, as measured by line-of-therapy (fourth-line or later), NEE dose (>0.5 µg/kg/min), or time from shock onset (>24 hours). 34 , 94 , 125–132 Observations of poor outcomes are unsurprising, given the risk of confounding and lack of consistency between clinical trial and real-world use. For example, AT-II patients treated in ATHOS-3 were most often receiving 1 (30.1%) or 2 (49.7%) vasoactive agents at baseline. Furthermore, the median NEE dose at baseline was 0.34 µg/kg/min. A multivariate logistic regression of ATHOS-3 observed a significantly lower odds of MAP response at hour 3 when the baseline NEE dose was ≥0.5 µg/kg/min compared with <0.5 µg/kg/min (odds ratio [95% CI]: 0.40 [0.21-0.77], P = .006). Subsequent investigations into the earlier, non-salvage use of AT-II suggest potential improvements in hemodynamic and/or clinical outcomes. Smith et al. observed that AT-II use at <0.2 µg/kg/min NEE was associated with a significantly greater NEE dose reduction at hour 3 (−71.5% vs. 26.3%, P = .01). 127 More recently, a post-hoc analysis of ATHOS-3 patients receiving ≤0.25 µg/kg/min NEE at baseline observed a significantly improved 28-day survival in patients treated with AT-II compared with placebo with standard-of-care vasoactive agents (64% vs. 48%, P = .03). 105 These data suggest that AT-II may have a role as part of an early multimodal approach to the initiation of vasoactive agents.\n\nTwo feasibility trials have recently compared first-line AT-II with catecholamines in distributive shock. 107 , 133 See et al. conducted a prospective, observational study of 40 patients who received AT-II as the primary vasoactive agent in septic shock and compared the outcomes with that of a propensity-matched, historical control group of 80 patients receiving conventional vasoactive agents. Treatment with AT-II was associated with reduced ICU mortality (10% vs. 26%, P = .04), although neither 28-day (18% vs. 29%, P = .18) nor 90-day (22% vs. 30%, P = .39) mortality were significantly different. Renal-related outcomes, including peak serum creatinine (SCr), AKI incidence and stage, and RRT requirement, also did not differ between groups, although peak SCr through day 7 was significantly lower in AT-II–treated patients on ACE inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers. Elevated serum troponin also occurred significantly less frequently in AT-II–treated patients (8%) compared with those treated with conventional pressors (22%; P = .04). Coulson et al. conducted a double-blind, randomized feasibility study of first-line AT-II compared with NE in the setting of cardiac surgery patients requiring CPB. 133 In this study, 60 patients at risk of post-operative AKI were randomized to receive intraoperative NE ( n = 32) or AT-II ( n = 28) to maintain MAP perioperatively. Intraoperatively, a lower, non-statistically significant incidence of epinephrine (7% vs. 19%, P = .26), milrinone (7% vs. 13%, P = .68), open-label NE (4% vs. 6%), and blood-product transfusion (14% vs. 28%, P = .22) was observed in AT-II–treated patients. In the ICU, an approximately 10-hour difference in study drug duration favored AT-II–treated patients (5.0 vs. 14.5 hours, P = .08). The incidence of 7-day AKI (25% vs. 38%, P = .31) did not differ significantly; however, a significantly lower hospital length of stay was observed in AT-II–treated patients (6.3 vs. 8.1 days, P = .04). The pilot nature and included patient populations of these studies certainly preclude causal conclusions and generalizability to burn patients.\n\nSAFETY CONSIDERATIONS AND OTHER CHALLENGES\n\nAdverse event rates of synthetic AT-II administration in the burn population are unknown. In vitro and in vivo studies have reported that RAAS activation and subsequent formation of endogenous Ang-II promotes procoagulant activity through stimulation of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, sensitization of platelets, and promotion of superoxide radical formation. 134 Indeed, the package labeling for synthetic AT-II contains a warning/precaution describing the potential for venous and arterial thrombotic and thromboembolic events in patients receiving synthetic AT-II and recommends the use of concurrent venous thromboembolism (VTE) prophylaxis. 135 This precaution/warning was primarily driven by an imbalance of deep vein thrombosis in ATHOS-3. 104 Notably, most events occurring in the synthetic AT-II arm of ATHOS-3 were mild to moderate in severity and not temporally associated with study drug infusion. 136 Patients with severe burn injury may be at an increased risk of VTE as burn injury may modulate all 3 elements of Virchow’s triad—endothelial injury, hypercoagulability, and venous stasis. 137 There is a wide variance in reported incidence of VTE in patients with burn injury ranging from 0.25% to 47.1%. 138 Careful consideration of the risk of VTE and the use of VTE prophylaxis should be made in a patient-specific manner prior to the initiation of synthetic AT-II.\n\nThe use of peripherally administered vasoactive agents, particularly NE, is increasingly common, as evidenced by the recommendation of the 2021 SSC Guidelines to not delay vasoactive agent initiation until central venous access is obtained. 25 Multiple systematic reviews and meta-analyses have deemed peripheral administration of vasoactive agents as generally safe with a relatively low incidence of complications. 139–141 Notably, peripherally administered vasopressin is underrepresented in these analyses and some controversy exists regarding its use in clinical practice. 142 Likewise, there is a paucity of data regarding safety of peripheral AT-II administration. 143 Currently, the package insert recommends administration via a central venous line 135 ; however, if peripheral administration is required, the manufacturer recommends administering a diluted product (2.5 µg/mL) at lower doses (≤10 ng/kg/min). 144 Consideration of central line access should be made prior to prescribing synthetic AT-II, and clinicians should follow institutional policies as applicable. 145\n\nAn additional consideration surrounding the use of synthetic AT-II in severe burn injury patients is their changing physiology. 146 For example, low cardiac output and high vascular resistance characterize the “ebb” phase of burn shock in which a potent vasoconstrictor like synthetic AT-II may offer limited or less benefit compared to agents with inotropic properties. A transition to high-output, vasodilatory shock in the subsequent 24-48 hours post-injury is typical; however, numerous patient and process-of-care factors contribute to its precise timing and management. Combined with the ongoing need to consider and/or manage hypovolemia, mixed shock in the setting of severe burn injury complicates routine or standardized use of synthetic AT-II. This inherent, off-label use in mixed shock patients was not the focus of randomized trials; however, real-world data have described its use in various forms of shock. 34 , 127 , 132 , 147\n\nThe differing pathophysiology between burn and other forms of distributive shock underscores their different management and the potential for distinct dosing. Unfortunately, specific dosing recommendations and their safety implications for burn patients are absent. Busse et al. conducted a systematic review of the safety of IV AT-II in human patients. 148 Their review included 1124 studies comprised of 31 281 subjects who received various preparations of exogenous AT-II. Infusion rates ranged from 0.05 to 3780 ng/kg/min, but the majority of subjects received ≤30 ng/kg/min. The systematic review noted infrequent adverse events associated with IV AT-II administration. Patients in the ATHOS-3 trial treated with synthetic AT-II responded to a mean dose of 20 ng/kg/min and had a median time to MAP response of 5 minutes. 104 Dose responsiveness in burn shock is not well characterized and it is, therefore, reasonable to follow dosing recommendations provided by the package insert. It is also reasonable to follow package insert dosing recommendations for hemodynamic support in burn patients with septic shock regardless of their exclusion in the ATHOS-3 study. Despite the weight-based dosing of synthetic AT-II, there is no published literature regarding the selection of the dosing weight for the infusion. Moreover, patients with burn injury are known to have significant changes in body weight throughout their admission. 149 Within the ATHOS-3 trial, the dosing weight was determined by body weight collected or estimated upon patient admission, if available. Given the hydrophilicity, direct action upon the vasculature, and short plasma half-life (<1 minute) of AT-II, it is reasonable to considering utilizing the lower of the patient’s recorded weight or ideal body weight.\n\nFUTURE DIRECTIONS AND RESEARCH\n\nAforementioned studies have associated RAAS dysregulation (as measured by elevated Ang-I to Ang-II ratio [Ang-I:Ang-II] or renin concentration) with mortality and other clinical outcomes and established the hypothesis that response to synthetic AT-II in distributive shock may improve hemodynamic and clinical outcomes. The dynamics of the RAAS, the effect of its dysregulation on outcomes, and the effect of synthetic AT-II administration on RAAS and clinical outcomes remain underexplored and should be a focus of future research in severe burn injury. Furthermore, the lack of routine collection, availability, and timely turnaround of RAAS biomarkers that may affect clinical decision-making must also be at the forefront of consideration in the future. Currently, there is no point-of-care system to quickly measure the biomarkers, so clinicians are at the mercy of their institution’s capabilities, or most likely a send-out lab with a 5-7 days turnaround time. Growing evidence supporting the prognostic and personalization potential of plasma renin concentrations may be of particular focus/interest. Observations of plasma renin levels up to 25 times the upper limit of normal in the first 8 hours of burn injury coupled with variations in serum ACE activity and Ang-II levels across heterogeneous burn populations further accentuate the interplay and need for continued research. 91–95\n\nA clinical scenario that should be the focus of future research for synthetic AT-II use in patients with severe burn injury is within the hemodynamic support of patients undergoing acute burn shock resuscitation requiring vasoactive agent support. Undoubtedly, burn shock is primarily hypovolemic in nature, but the combination of intravascular volume depletion, increased vascular permeability, endotheliopathy, thromboinflammation, increased SVR, and reduced cardiac output leads to a unique redistributive shock state. 10 Crystalloid-sparing strategies such as colloid infusions are generally considered in patients with high crystalloid volume requirements, persistent hypotension, and hypoalbuminemia. Despite the hypovolemic presentation, outside of colloid administration, early vasoactive agent use is the most common adjunctive volume minimization technique. 47 , 150 The large, multicenter, observational ABRUPT study demonstrated that vasopressors were deployed in 11.5% of patients concomitantly utilizing albumin infusions during resuscitation. 150 There is a scarcity of literature to support this practice, and the clinical equipoise around vasoactive agent use and other optimal burn resuscitation practices requires large, multicenter, randomized research. When vasoactive agents are initiated in acute burn resuscitation, observational studies and surveys have described catecholamine-based regimens as the primary strategy, although non-catecholamine use (ie, vasopressin) also exists. 5 , 70 These studies and surveys were completed before or shortly after the FDA approval of synthetic AT-II. Pending clinical utilization of synthetic AT-II in this setting, future surveys and observational data should describe its use to aid in describing associated practice patterns, safety, and efficacy. Such analyses should consider clinical contributors and confounders to vasoactive agent selection and exposure such as fluid resuscitation/status, cardiac function, and concomitant medications (eg, analgesics, sedatives, and anxiolytics). There remains no clinical data or consensus to guide the selection of specific vasoactive agents in acute burn resuscitation. Given the described RAAS dysregulation and catecholamine release in this patient population, future research may explore first-line or second-line use of synthetic AT-II in select clinical scenarios or patient phenotypes. Finally, consideration must broadly be given to triggers of vasoactive agent initiation in the setting of acute resuscitation. A recent multicenter observational trial associated a diastolic blood pressure of less than 40 mmHg with oliguria. 151 This represents an objective, modifiable target with physiologic rationale where vasoactive agent initiation and/or personalized selection may impact clinical outcomes.\n\nAn additional area of future research resides in severe burn-injured patients who develop sepsis or septic shock. Published literature on vasoactive agent use/practices in this population is scant and deserving of future observational research. As described above, consideration of clinical contributors and confounders to vasoactive agent selection and exposure is warranted. The pronounced and sustained hypermetabolic response mediated by endogenous catecholamines (up to 50 times normal levels) and corticosteroids may also offer unique directions and areas of focus for research. 53 , 152 In this context, it is unknown if exogenously administered catecholamines exhibit a similar therapeutic index and safety profile in septic shock patients with and without severe burn injury. Moreover, unlike acute burn resuscitation guidelines, the 2023 SSABC provided recommendations for vasopressor selection in patients with burn injury who develop sepsis. Specifically, and in direct reference to the 2021 SSC guidelines, the SSABC recommended NE as the first-line vasopressor, but no recommendation was made surrounding the second-line vasopressor. 7 While Cartotto et al. observed that utilization of vasopressin as a primary and adjunctive vasoactive agent resulted in modest hemodynamic response and catecholamine-sparing properties in burn patients with sepsis, over half of those administered vasopressin as the primary vasoactive agent required the addition of NE for hemodynamic support. 5 These data do not adequately address gaps around the order and timing of vasoactive agent initiation in this population and highlight the frequency of inadequate response to current vasoactive agents. Additional data supporting the benefits of beta-adrenergic blockade to attenuate the catecholamine-mediated hypermetabolism in patients with severe burn injury may further support investigation of first-line AT-II or other non-catecholamine-based vasoactive agent strategies within this population. 153 , 154 Finally, the benefits of utilizing low doses of multiple vasoactive agents with differing mechanisms to potentially identify and optimize response and mitigate risk associated with high-dose catecholamine exposure should be explored, especially in the absence of readily available biomarkers and high potential for refractory shock.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nPractices for hemodynamic support with vasoactive agents in patients with severe burn injury during acute burn resuscitation and septic shock in patients with severe burn injury lack consistency and data to support clinical decisions. Synthetic AT-II is a non-catecholamine, endogenous vasoactive agent and a key mediator for the RAAS, which is known to be perturbed in patients with burn injury. While the use of synthetic AT-II in burn patients shows promise based on biological rationale, there are no published reports of the use of AT-II in this patient population to support efficacy or safety. The use of synthetic AT-II should be the subject of future research in patients with severe burn injury to better inform their hemodynamic management throughout the arc of their recovery.",
