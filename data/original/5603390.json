  "title": "Operative Strategies To Reduce Cerebral Embolic Events During On- and Off-Pump Coronary Artery Bypass Surgery: A Stratified, Prospective Randomized Trial",
  "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to determine the impact of different aortic clamping strategies on the incidence of cerebral embolic events during coronary artery bypass grafting(CABG).\n\nMETHODS: From 2012–2015, 142 patients with low-grade aortic disease (epiaortic ultrasound grade I /II) undergoing primary isolated CABG were studied. Those undergoing off-pump CABG were randomized to a partial clamp (n=36) or clampless facilitating device (CFD, n=36) strategy. Those undergoing on-pump CABG were randomized to a single (n=34) or double (n=36) clamp strategy. Transcranial Doppler ultrasonography (TCD) was performed to identify high intensity transient signals (HITS) in the middle cerebral arteries during periods of aortic manipulation. Neurocognitive testing was performed at baseline and 30-days postoperatively. The primary endpoint was total number of HITS detected by TCD. The Mann-Whitney test was performed to compare groups.\n\nRESULTS: In the off-pump group, median total HITS were higher in the CFD group (30.0, IQR 22–43) compared to the partial clamp group (7.0, IQR 0–16) (p<0.0001). For the CFD group, median number of HITS for patients with one CFD was 12.5 (IQR 4–19) compared to 36 (IQR 25–47) for patients with >1 CFD (p=0.001). For the on-pump group, median total HITS were 10.0 (IQR 3–17) in the single-clamp group compared to 16.0 (IQR 4–49, p=0.10) in the double-clamp group. There were no differences in neurocognitive outcomes.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: For patients with low-grade aortic disease, the use of CFDs resulted in more cerebral embolic events compared to partial clamping during off-pump CABG. A single-clamp strategy during on-pump CABG did not significantly reduce embolic events compared to a double-clamp strategy.",
