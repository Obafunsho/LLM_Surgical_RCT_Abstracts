  "full_text": "Introduction\n\nWomen undergoing mastectomy increasingly opt for post-mastectomy breast reconstruction (PMBR) to improve quality of life (QoL), body image, and psychosocial well-being 1–4 . PMBR may use breast implants, autologous tissue, or a combination of both, and can be performed immediately or in a delayed surgical procedure 5 .\n\nThe decision-making process regarding type and timing of PMBR is complex, requiring careful consideration of surgical feasibility, logistical constraints, need and timing of (neo)adjuvant therapies, co-morbidities, body composition, and patient preferences 6 , 7 . Ideally, PMBR is a shared decision between the patient and multidisciplinary team, aligning oncological priorities with personal preferences to enhance long-term satisfaction with reconstructive outcomes 6–10 . Engaging in shared decision-making (SDM) can be challenging; women may experience difficulty understanding complex information and navigating choices, particularly following a recent breast cancer diagnosis, which can lead to decisional conflict and decisional regret 6 , 11 .\n\nPatient decision aids (pDAs) support SDM by helping patients make informed choices that reflect their values, aiming to reduce decisional conflict while improving patient knowledge, satisfaction, and psychosocial well-being 11–14 . Decision-support tools specifically designed for PMBR however remain scarce, and it is unclear whether a PMBR-specific pDA offers benefits beyond high-quality standard care. In a setting of high-quality multidisciplinary care, an online PMBR-specific pDA tailored to the needs of Dutch women was developed and introduced one week prior to the patient’s initial consultation with a plastic surgeon.\n\nAn RCT was conducted to assess whether a pDA for PMBR reduces decisional conflict immediately after reconstructive decision compared to high-quality standard care. The secondary aim was to evaluate the impact of a pDA on the decision-making process, patient-reported outcomes (PROs), and surgical outcomes immediately after reconstructive decision and 1-year after surgery.\n\nMethods\n\nDesign\n\nA single-centre, two-arm, parallel group RCT was conducted at a large community teaching hospital in the Netherlands, where six plastic surgeons performed immediate and delayed PMBR. Patients were invited to participate between October 2019 and June 2023 by their oncological surgeon or nurse. After providing informed consent, participants were randomly assigned to a 1:1 ratio to the intervention or control group. Block randomization, with six patients per block, was used, with a computer-generated sequence concealed until assignment. The allocation sequence was independently generated and managed by an investigator (J.K.), who was not involved in patient enrolment, assignment, or data analysis. The control group received standard care alone and the intervention group received standard care and access to the pDA. Blinding of patients, plastic surgeons, and researchers after assignment was not performed due to practical constraints.\n\nQuestionnaires were administered to participants at T0—baseline, one week before their first consultation with the plastic surgeon, T1—immediately after reconstructive decision and T2—1-year post-surgery.\n\nThe trial was registered in the International Clinical Trial Registry Platform (ICTRP; NL-OMON28003). The study adhered to the Declaration of Helsinki (version 2013) and the Medical Research Involving Human Subjects Act, followed CONSORT guidelines, and was approved by the Medical Research Ethics Committee (MEC-U reg. no. W19.176) 15 .\n\nParticipants\n\nWomen who were 18 years or older, required unilateral or bilateral mastectomy due to invasive or in situ breast cancer or due to prophylactic reasons, and were eligible for delayed or immediate PMBR. The patients had to have the ability to complete an online questionnaire and to comprehend the sixth-grade reading-level language used in the pDA and provide written informed consent. Women with prior breast reconstruction, those that already had discussed PMBR, had previously accessed a pDA for PMBR, or had metastatic disease were excluded. Following enrolment, some participants initially scheduled for mastectomy became eligible for and underwent breast-conserving surgery (BCS) after neoadjuvant systemic therapy. These participants were included in the analysis immediately after reconstructive decision (T1), reflecting real-world clinical decision-making, where treatment pathways may change after initial assessment and SDM. They were, however, excluded from the analysis at 1-year post-surgery (T2), as they did not undergo mastectomy or PMBR.\n\nIntervention\n\nAn online pDA for PMBR ( https://www.keuzehulp.info/front-page/keuzehulpen/borstreconstructie ) was developed using the Ottawa Decision Support Framework and International Patient Decision Aid Standards checklist 16 . Content was derived from local and international guidelines and co-created with decision aid experts, linguists, medical professionals, and patients. The Easy Reading Foundation (Stichting Makkelijk Lezen) ensured a sixth-grade reading level, optimizing accessibility for low health literacy 17 . The pDA was reviewed by members of the Dutch Breast Cancer Association (Borstkanker Vereniging Nederland)—patient representatives with lived experience of breast cancer and reconstruction. Their recommendations were incorporated into the pDA 18 . The pDA featured multiple modules providing a comprehensive overview as well as comparison of the different options for type and timing of PMBR, highlighting their benefits, disadvantages, associated risks, and expected outcomes. The pDA also addressed common misconceptions. Embedded close-ended questions checked real-time understanding of provided information. Several media types, including text, realistic photos, illustrations, and videos enhanced engagement. Value clarification exercises (visual-analogue scales, multiple choice and free-text questions) helped patients to align informed choices with personal values. A final summary consolidated personal preferences, expectations, and outstanding questions to facilitate SDM. The pDA takes approximately 15–20 min to complete and is updated every 2 years or whenever new guidelines are introduced to ensure integration of the best available evidence.\n\nThe intervention group was granted access to this online pDA one week before their first consultation with a plastic surgeon and patients were instructed to complete it beforehand. Completion status was monitored and reminders were issued to participants whose pDA remained incomplete prior to their initial appointment.\n\nStandard care\n\nBoth groups received high-quality multidisciplinary standard care. Prior to first consultation with the plastic surgeon, the oncological surgeon and/or nurse provided written information on the different types of PMBR, including pros, cons, potential complications as well as post-surgery guidelines and exercises through information leaflets. At the first consultation with the plastic surgeon, patients received a tailored verbal explanation, supplemented by photos and drawings of surgical PMBR options, and referral to a relevant website: BBewust (b-bewust.nl [in Dutch]) providing information and visual resources. When desired, additional consultations were scheduled with the plastic surgeon.\n\nStudy measures\n\nFollowing enrolment, participants completed an online questionnaire to collect baseline characteristics and responses to validated scales, including the Dutch General Self-Efficacy Scale (GSES), Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), and the preoperative BREAST-Q module. Clinical data regarding (neo-)adjuvant non-surgical treatments were retrieved from electronic medical patient records.\n\nOutcomes domains included: (1) decision-making process, (2) PROs, and (3) surgical outcomes. The primary outcome was decisional conflict immediately after reconstructive decision (T1), assessed using the Decisional Conflict Scale (DCS) 19 , 20 . Decisional conflict was also assessed 1-year post-surgery (T2) as a secondary outcome. The decision-making process was further evaluated using, the SDM-Q-9 questionnaire to measure patients’ perceived involvement in SDM, the CARE questionnaire to assess patient-rated physician empathy, and the Decision Regret Scale (DRS) to assess decision regret 21–23 . Satisfaction with consultation(s) and information provided was measured using a study-specific questionnaire (0–10 scale). Duration of the first reconstructive consultation (in minutes) was measured by the researcher, and the number of consultations prior to reconstructive decision was documented. Satisfaction with plastic surgeon was measured using postoperative BREAST-Q and changes in the treating plastic surgeon were obtained through a study-specific questionnaire.\n\nPROs included symptoms of anxiety and depression, measured with the HADS; satisfaction with breast(s), psychological well-being, sexual well-being, and physical well-being of the chest, evaluated using the postoperative BREAST-Q module; body image and breast symptoms, measured using the EORTC-QLQ-BR23 questionnaire; and overall satisfaction with treatment using a study-specific questionnaire (0–10 scale).\n\nSurgical outcomes included the reconstructive choices (that is type and timing) and received breast surgeries, along with changes to surgical pathways (following initial reconstructive decisions). Data were collected through a study-specific questionnaire or obtained from electronic medical patient records when missing. A detailed overview of outcome measures and data collection is provided as Supplementary material ( Appendix I , Table S1 ).\n\nSample size\n\nManne et al . reported a mean decisional conflict score of 34 in patients considering PMBR 24 . An a priori sample size calculation determined that 57 patients per group would be needed to detect an eight-point difference in decisional conflict, assuming a decisional conflict score of 34 (s.d. 15) in the control group, with an alpha of 0.05 and power of 0.80. This corresponds to a medium effect size of 0.53. Allowing for a 5% loss to follow-up, a target sample size was set at 120 included participants (that is 60 participants per study arm).\n\nStatistical methods\n\nDescriptive statistics were summarized as means with standard deviations for continuous variables and as counts with percentages for categorical variables. Between-group differences at each time point were evaluated using independent t -tests for normally distributed continuous variables, Mann–Whitney U tests for non-normally distributed continuous variables, and chi-square tests for categorical variables.\n\nMean differences with 95% confidence intervals quantified outcomes, whereas effect sizes were determined by Cohen’s d as follows: small (0.2), medium (0.5), and large (0.8). Clinically relevant differences were predefined as those with an effect size of 0.5 or greater 25 . All analyses adhered to the intention-to-treat principle and were performed using IBM SPSS Statistics Version 29 and R Version 4.4.0.\n\nResults\n\nPatients\n\nRecruitment took place from August 2020 to May 2023, with follow-up completed in August 2024. Of 367 breast cancer patients assessed for eligibility, 213 were informed about the study. The main reasons for exclusion were choice of BCS, language barriers, and prior consultations with a plastic surgeon elsewhere. Informed consent was obtained from 134 participants, who completed the baseline questionnaire and were randomized to the intervention ( n = 66) or control ( n = 68) groups ( Fig. 1 ). Reasons for declining participation included low interest in research, concurrent enrolment in other studies, or short notice to consider participation. All patients in the intervention group completed the pDA. Response rates were 90% immediately after reconstructive decision, with 120 patients eligible for primary outcome analysis, and 87% at 1-year post-surgery, without significant differences between groups ( Table S2 ). Reasons for attrition included cancelled surgery (in palliative setting) or logistical transfers to other hospitals. All patients in the intervention group received and completed the pDA.\n\nBaseline demographics and clinical characteristics were comparable between the two groups, indicating successful randomization ( Table 1 ).\n\nPrimary outcome\n\nImmediately after reconstructive decision, mean decisional conflict scores were 17 (s.d. 12) in the intervention group and 20 (s.d. 18) in the control group, without statically significant differences (mean difference (MD) = −2.8, 95% c.i., −8.4 to 2.8, P = 0.319) and a small effect size (Cohen’s d = −0.18; Table 2 ).\n\nSecondary outcomes\n\nDecision-making process\n\nImmediately after reconstructive decision, no significant differences were observed between groups in patients’ perceived involvement in SDM, patient-rated physician empathy or satisfaction with consultation and information, duration of the first consultation, or the number of consultations ( Table 2 ).\n\nAt 1-year post-surgery, no significant differences were found in decisional conflict, decision regret, satisfaction with information, satisfaction with treatment, satisfaction with surgeon, or change in treating plastic surgeon ( Table 2 ).\n\nPatient-reported outcomes\n\nImmediately after reconstructive decision, no significant differences were found between groups regarding symptoms of anxiety and depression.\n\nAt 1-year post-surgery, no significant differences were observed between intervention and control groups in symptoms of anxiety and depression, satisfaction with breast(s), psychological well-being, physical well-being of the chest, sexual well-being, body image, breast-related symptoms, or satisfaction with treatment ( Table 2 ).\n\nSurgical outcomes\n\nThere were no significant differences in actual reconstructive choices, including the decision to undergo reconstruction, as well as the type and timing of the procedure ( Table 3 ). The majority of the participants underwent immediate PMBR, most commonly with autologous techniques. At 1-year post-surgery, no significant differences were observed in changes to surgical pathways between groups ( Table 3 ).\n\nDiscussion\n\nIn this RCT, the online pDA designed for women considering PMBR did not reduce decisional conflict. Both groups received high-quality standard care, resulting in consistently low levels of decisional conflict. No significant differences were observed immediately after reconstructive decision or 1-year post-surgery in any measure related to the decision-making process, PROs, or surgical outcomes.\n\nResults diverged from the broader evidence supporting the effectiveness of pDAs in facilitating decision-making. A meta-analysis of 209 studies across various clinical contexts found that pDAs increased patient participation in decision-making 26 . pDA’s for oncological treatment of breast cancer, such as choices between BCS and mastectomy and/or decisions about systemic therapy—have been demonstrated to reduce decisional conflict while improving patient knowledge 11 , 27 , 28 . Patients considering PMBR however tend to be younger, more digitally literate, and are considering expected aesthetic results in addition to oncological outcomes, which may influence their information-seeking behaviour.\n\nSpecifically for PMBR, a recent network meta-analysis of 14 RCTs showed that pDA users experienced significantly less decisional conflict and regret, alongside improved knowledge and satisfaction 29 . The reported effect sizes were, however, small. Heterogeneity of the included studies, such as variations in pDA quality, timing of introduction (relative to consultations), delivery methods (for example web-based versus paper-based), outcomes measures, and type of PMBR performed (for example primarily delayed versus immediate), complicated direct comparisons with the present study.\n\nIn a study by Sherman et al ., pDA users reported significantly less decisional conflict one month after randomization (MD = −8.3), but their study lacked standardization of information provided to control groups across different study sites and had low participant numbers per site (<30) resulting in practice variation 30 . Mean DCS scores in their control group at 1- and 6-month follow-up (that is 36 and 31 respectively) were considerably higher than the DCS scores observed in the present control group immediately after reconstructive decision and at 1 year after surgery (that is 20 and 25 respectively). Although timelines do not align, substantial differences in decisional conflict highlight the extent to which the control group in the present study was well-informed and supported. Their cohort primarily focused on delayed PMBR (54%), limiting the applicability of their finding to the present setting, in which immediate PMBR was more performed. Additionally, their study was prone to self-selection bias due to a high dropout rate (27%) of participants having greater social support. In contrast, the current trial experienced only 13% attrition at one-year follow-up. Known reasons for attrition and declining participations were likely unrelated to key concepts such as decision-making confidence, self-efficacy, social support, anxiety or information-seeking behaviour, thereby mitigating the risk of selection bias in the current trial.\n\nIn this study, decisional conflict was low in both groups (that is ≤25), indicating that women were generally ready to implement a decision 19 . The low decisional conflict in the control group suggests that the standard care provided at the study institution effectively met patient decision-making needs. Women in both groups reported high satisfaction with the information provided and felt well-supported in their decision-making, likely diminishing the potential effect of the pDA. This comprehensive care left minimal room for further improvement and likely diminished the potential effect of the pDA. Key components of the high-level decisional support include: close collaboration among the multidisciplinary team (that is plastic surgeons, oncologic surgeons, radiotherapists, oncologists, and physician assistants), oncological surgeons and physician assistants dedicating time prior to the consultation with plastic surgeon to inform patients regarding reconstructive options, structured information leaflets with links to websites and visual resources to ensure patients have access to accurate resources in multiple formats, and individualized decisional support during consultations. Yet, study enrolment might have heightened awareness for involvement in shared-decision making and encouraged greater information-seeking behaviour in the control group, also known as the Hawthorne effect 31 .\n\nThe findings of this trial align with those of Ter Stege et al . and Politi et al ., both of which did not observe significant differences in decision conflict, SDM, or QoL between web-based pDA users and those receiving enhanced standard care 32 , 33 . Ter Stege et al . conducted an RCT in women considering immediate PMBR comparing an online pDA with enhanced standard care, which included actively providing a typical Dutch information leaflet 32 . Similarly, Politi et al . evaluated a web-based pDA compared to enhanced usual care, where participants received the American Society of Plastic Surgeons pamphlet about PMBR 33 . Although improvements were reported in patient knowledge and preparedness, this did not translate into reduced decisional conflict. These findings suggests that although pDAs may enhance patients’ knowledge, they might not outperform standard care in reducing decisional conflict in already well-supported settings. Although objective knowledge was not assessed as a separate outcome measure in the present study, the pDA included close-ended questions to confirm real-time understanding of information, and perceived comprehension was measured by the DCS ‘informed’ subscale as part of the primary outcome assessment. Both groups scored similarly low on this subscale (mean 18 in the pDA group versus 19 in the control group), with a lower score depicting stronger perceived understanding, indicating that both groups felt equally well informed (data not shown). Another explanation for the findings of the current study is that the pDA may not have been optimally designed. If the pDA did not deliver information in a sufficiently engaging or accessible format, patients may not have used it in a way that meaningfully impacted their decision-making. Wilkens et al . however reported a reduction in decisional conflict when using a comparable pDA that followed the same guidelines for development for decisions regarding trapeziometacarpal arthritis 34 . Similarly, Mardinger et al . compared two pDAs with varying levels of interactivity and found that both pDAs equally reduced decisional conflict over time 35 . Their study was, however, conducted in a low-volume centre, where the pDA was provided between two consultations with the same plastic surgeon. In contrast, the current trial was conducted in a high-volume, multisurgeon environment, with the pDA provided before the first consultation. Additionally, their study lacked a control group, so the observed trend in decisional conflict may reflect the natural course of decisional conflict over time.\n\nApart from patients, healthcare professionals may also benefit from offering pDAs. In a qualitative study, Sherman et al . found that, from a health professionals’ perspective, pDAs could help patients prepare for medical appointments, thereby making consultations more efficient 36 . Despite this, the current study found no difference in consultation length with the use of the pDA, consistent with findings from previous research 26 . Nonetheless, pDAs could still reduce unwanted practice variation in the SDM process among healthcare professionals by standardizing patient information 37 .\n\nA key strength of this study is its randomized controlled design and high response rates. However, a limitation is that one of the plastic surgeons was involved in creating and updating information for the pDA. Although the pDA was approved by all participating plastic and oncologic surgeons, this involvement may have influenced them to prime their standard of care regarding decisional support. Practical constraints prevented blinding of plastic surgeons to treatment allocation. No plastic surgeon-dependent differences were however found in exploratory analysis of the primary outcome regardless of treatment allocation (data not shown).\n\nShared decision-making is indispensable to PMBR given the inherently complex and profoundly personal nature of choices involved. This RCT found that, within a setting of high-quality standard care, the addition of an online patient decision aid did not further reduce decisional conflict. Both approaches consistently achieved low levels of decisional conflict, suggesting they were equally effective in supporting informed decision-making. In an era focused on the continuous enhancement of patient engagement, these findings highlight that context matters: in well-resourced multidisciplinary settings, standard care alone can effectively provide decisional support regarding PMBR.",
