Aortic valve stenosis (AS) is a progressive disorder that narrows the aortic valve, thus restricting the blood flow. AS prevalence increases with age, necessitating heart valve replacements [ 2 , 3 ] . Traditionally, SAVR has been the standard of care for severely symptomatic AS patients. However, TAVR has emerged as a less invasive alternative, particularly for those at high surgical risk or deemed inoperable by SAVR [ 4 – 6 ] . While TAVR has expanded its applicability and has proven efficacy, its role in low-risk patients is still being defined [ 4 – 6 ] , necessitating a thorough evaluation of the comparative safety and long-term outcomes of TAVR and SAVR across the spectrum of surgical risk [ 7 , 8 ] . Technological advancements in both procedures over the years further emphasize the need for such comparative analyses [ 9 ] .\n\nSurgical risk stratification is essential for guiding treatment decisions in AS. The Society of Thoracic Surgeons (STS) risk score is commonly used to assess surgical risk, with scores categorized as low (≤4%), intermediate (4%–8%), and high (≥8%) [ 10 ] . Although the STS score is commonly used, other risk assessment tools, such as EuroSCORE II, may also be used [ 11 ] . However, it is essential to note that clinical judgment, along with shared decision-making between the patient and the heart team, is paramount in determining the most appropriate treatment strategy, regardless of the risk score. This comparative analysis aims to bridge the gap in knowledge to better facilitate shared decision-making.\n\nPrior studies have demonstrated similar 1-year mortality rates between TAVR and SAVR in intermediate-risk patients [ 7 ] . Specifically, the PARTNER 2 trial [ 12 ] showed comparable outcomes in this population. Consistent aortic valve sizing between SAVR and TAVR is crucial for optimal prosthesis function and long-term outcomes [ 13 ] , regardless of surgical risk. The choice between TAVR and SAVR depends on a multitude of factors, including clinical outcomes, anatomical considerations, procedural factors, and importantly, the patient’s surgical risk profile. This underscores the importance of a multidisciplinary heart team approach to ensure individualized treatment plans [ 14 ] . While long-term health status outcomes have shown similarities between TAVR and SAVR, mortality rates remain a concern in both groups, particularly in higher-risk patients [ 15 ] .\n\nThis systematic review and meta-analysis aims to analyze and compare SAVR and TAVR across the spectrum of surgical risk in the management of AS, rigorously examining the safety and long-term outcomes of each treatment, providing clinicians with the most current evidence to inform treatment decisions and ultimately improve patient care.\n\nMethods\n\nThis analysis was conducted in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISM) guidelines and reported in accordance with the Assessing the methodological quality of systematic reviews guidelines [ 16 , 17 ] . The protocol of the study was registered in the Open Science Framework (OSF) registry (Id: OSF.IO/X35KY) [ 18 ] . For relevant literature, a comprehensive literature search was conducted in several prominent reliable databases, including PubMed/MEDLINE, Scopus, clinicaltrails.gov, and Science Direct. Subject headings and keywords for “Transaortic catheter valve replacement,” “surgical aortic valve replacement,” “Aortic Valve/surgery,” “Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement,” “SAVR,” “TAVR,” and “Mortality” were successfully added to search terms using appropriate Boolean operators. The references of the selected studies were also examined to verify the comprehensiveness of the search. The search strategy utilized for the study is outlined in Supplemental Digital Content File S1, available at: http://links.lww.com/MS9/A796 . Studies within the last 10 years that compared the clinical outcomes of adult patients who underwent either SAVR or transaortic catheter valve replacement were included. A detailed list of inclusion and exclusion criteria was outlined in Supplemental Digital Content File S2, available at: http://links.lww.com/MS9/A796 . Two reviewers, I.G. and K.G.K., screened the title and abstract independently, and conflicts were resolved by mutual agreement. Full-text screening was done independently by two reviewers, A.R. and W.W. The third reviewer, M.M., resolved conflicts concerning the full-text screening. Figure 1 depicts the PRISMA flowchart outlining the study selection process [ 19 ] .\n\nRegarding the quality appraisal of the studies, the methodological quality of the studies included was evaluated separately by two reviewers, A.A. and H.S. Furthermore, the risk of bias assessment of the included studies was assessed using Cochrane RoB2 (Supplemental Digital Content File S3, available at: http://links.lww.com/MS9/A796 ). Statistical analysis was done using RevMan 5.4.1 (Cochrane 2020). Descriptive statistics (Chi-square test for categorical variables and Independent samples t -test for continuous variables) were used to compare the outcomes. Binary random effects were used to estimate the odds ratio (OR), and continuous random effects were used to estimate the mean differences (MD). Regarding outcomes, Procedural outcomes included discharge disposition (home vs. other facility) and length of hospitalization. Safety outcomes, assessed primarily at 30 days, included all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, incidence of stroke, major bleeding, acute kidney injury (AKI), myocardial infarction (MI), atrial fibrillation (AF), and change in the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire – Overall Score (KCCQ-OS). A P -value <0.05 was considered statistically significant. I 2 statistics were used to assess for heterogeneity. Risk of Bias assessment of included studies was reported in Supplemental Digital Content File S3, available at: http://links.lww.com/MS9/A796 , and funnel plots were used to assess for publication bias (Supplemental Digital Content File S4, available at: http://links.lww.com/MS9/A796 ).\n\nResults\n\nBaseline characteristics\n\nA total of eight RCTs were included in our meta-analysis [ 20 – 27 ] . In total, 18 671 aortic stenosis patients were included in our study. The mean age of the study population was 80.09 ± 7.08 years, and 44.34% of them were females. The baseline characteristics of all the included studies are described in Table 1 .\n\nProcedural outcomes\n\nPatients who underwent TAVR had a higher percentage of discharge to homes compared to SAVR (ratio of discharge to home to facility, 5.14 vs. 1.45) (procedural outcomes in Table 2 ), higher odds of discharge to home (OR: 4.46; 95% CI: 2.58–7.71; P < 0.00001), significantly lower odds of discharge to another facility (OR: 0.24; 95% CI: 0.21–0.27; P < 0.00001) and lesser duration of hospitalization (MD: −4.03; 95% CI: −4.66 to 3.39; P < 0.0001) (Fig. 2 ).\n\nSafety outcomes\n\nAt 30 days post-procedure, patients who underwent TAVR had a lower percentage of all-cause mortality (2.48% vs. 3.03%), incidence of stroke (3.2% vs. 4.1%), and major bleeding (11.26% vs. 31%) (30-day outcomes in Table 2 ). Patients who underwent TAVR were associated with significantly lower odds of all-cause mortality (OR: 0.79; 95% CI: 0.63–1.00; P = 0.05), AKI (OR: 0.38; 95% CI: 0.29–0.49; P < 0.0001), AF (OR: 0.19; 95% CI: 0.09–0.39; P < 0.00001), major bleeding (OR: 0.29; 95% CI: 0.14–0.60; P < 0.00001), incidence of stroke (OR: 0.71; 95% CI: 0.58–0.87; P = 0.0008), and higher MD in KCCQ-OS (MD: 12.76; 95% CI: 8.61–16.91; P < 0.00001). Furthermore, patients who underwent TAVR were associated with lower odds of cardiovascular mortality (OR: 0.89; 95% CI: 0.66–1.20; P = 0.44) and MI (OR: 0.71; 95% CI: 0.44–1.16; P = 0.17). However, these findings were not statistically significant. Figures 3 and 4 illustrate the forest plots of safety outcomes.\n\nDiscussion\n\nThis comprehensive meta-analysis, including eight RCTs and 18 671 patients, comparing TAVR and SAVR for management of AS, demonstrates that TAVR is associated with significantly better patient disposition post-procedure and lower adverse effects at 30 days follow-up. TAVR significantly lowers the risks associated with all-cause mortality, AKI, AF, major bleeding, stroke, and change in the KCCQ-OS. Although not statistically significant, TAVR has a lower risk of cardiovascular death and MI compared to SAVR. Although previous studies reported that TAVR is advantageous regarding discharge disposition, those weren’t statistically significant [ 28 ] ; patients who underwent TAVR spent three to 4 days less in the hospital than those in the SAVR group [ 29 ] . However, our analysis of procedural outcomes demonstrates a clear and statistically significant advantage for TAVR regarding both discharge disposition and length of hospitalization, consistent with the less invasive nature of the procedure, and suggests potential benefits for patient recovery and resource utilization.\n\nWhile research on 30-day follow-up outcomes continues to evolve, our findings regarding better clinical outcomes in TAVR align with previous research [ 30 , 31 ] . However, some studies have reported no overall benefit of TAVR compared to SAVR [ 32 – 35 ] , and few studies have reported differential long-term benefits [ 36 ] . Regarding stroke incidence, our findings are supported by previous research [ 37 , 38 ] , including meta-analyses by Siontis et al [ 30 ] that have demonstrated similar trends, particularly within the first 30 days and potentially up to 1-year post-procedure. While some studies [ 14 , 39 ] have reported no significant difference in stroke rates between TAVR and SAVR, our results contribute to the growing body of evidence suggesting a potential benefit of TAVR in reducing this complication. The potential lack of significance in some individual trials may be attributable to their limited statistical power to detect differences in stroke incidence, highlighting the importance of pooled analyses such as ours [ 30 ] . Regarding all-cause mortality, TAVR was found to have lower in-hospital mortality, similar to findings of our study [ 28 ] . Our findings regarding major bleeding and AKI are also consistent with prior research, reinforcing the favorable safety profile of TAVR [ 14 , 30 , 31 , 36 , 37 , 40 – 42 ] . However, it’s essential to acknowledge the variability in results across studies, with some reporting no significant differences in mortality or stroke.\n\nStrengths and limitations\n\nOur findings on procedural outcomes are particularly relevant given the aging population with increasing comorbidities, where shorter recovery times and reduced need for postoperative acute care can be highly valuable. Regarding patient values and preferences of treatment choices between TAVR and SAVR, the current body of evidence reveals variability in individual choices [ 43 ] , highlighting the lack of comprehensive evidence in this patient population and the need for well-informed, shared decision-making. This meta-analysis can help bridge this gap.\n\nHowever, several limitations should be considered when interpreting the results of this meta-analysis. First, while we included a substantial number of patients, some heterogeneity among the included studies could have influenced our pooled estimates. Second, the follow-up duration varied across studies, limiting our ability to assess long-term outcomes beyond the reported timeframes fully. Third, although we examined a range of clinically relevant outcomes, we could not access individual patient data, which would have allowed for more detailed subgroup analyses and assessment of potential effect modifiers. Finally, variations in patient characteristics, operator experience, and institutional practices across the included trials may have contributed to outcome variability.\n\nClinical implications\n\nThe findings of this meta-analysis have significant clinical implications for managing patients with AS. Our results indicate that TAVR may be considered the preferred treatment strategy for many patients, particularly those at higher risk for surgical complications or those who prioritize shorter recovery times and discharge to home. However, the decision regarding TAVR versus SAVR should be made on an individual basis, taking into account patient-specific factors such as age, comorbidities, anatomical suitability, and patient preferences. Shared decision-making between the patient and the heart team is essential to ensure optimal treatment selection.\n\nFuture directions\n\nFurther research is necessary to address the limitations of this study and to enhance our understanding of the comparative effectiveness of TAVR and SAVR. Long-term follow-up studies are crucial for evaluating the durability of TAVR valves and comparing long-term survival and quality of life between the two procedures. Additional research is also required to identify specific patient subgroups that may benefit differently from TAVR or SAVR. Lastly, studies comparing the cost-effectiveness of TAVR and SAVR are needed to guide healthcare resource allocation. Future trials should emphasize standardized outcome reporting and include comprehensive assessments of valve performance, functional status, and patient-reported outcomes to offer a more comprehensive evaluation of these important therapies. Furthermore, larger, more diverse patient populations are needed in future trials to address the variability in findings in the current body of evidence.\n\nConclusion\n\nOur meta-analysis shows that TAVR offers significant advantages over SAVR, including reduced risks of major bleeding, stroke, all-cause mortality, and AKI, along with a shorter hospital stay. TAVR also resulted in improvements in the KCCQ-OS and a higher rate of discharge to home. While our findings largely align with existing literature, some variability in outcomes among individual studies underscores the need for larger and more diverse patient populations in future trials. Long-term follow-up studies are essential to evaluate valve durability and compare long-term survival and quality of life. Additionally, further research is necessary to identify patient subgroups that may benefit differently from each procedure and to conduct cost-effectiveness analyses.",
