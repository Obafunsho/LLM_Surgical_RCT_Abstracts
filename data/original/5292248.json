  "abstract": "While smoking cessation is a key priority for vascular surgeons, significant variation exists in the manner in which vascular surgeons address this key process of care. We describe a multicenter, cluster-randomized trial which compares a standardized, brief smoking cessation intervention to usual care for patients facing vascular surgery or endovascular interventions. Eight centers were randomized to provide either usual care for smoking cessation or a standardized protocol consisting of (1) physician “very brief advice” to stop smoking, (2) offering nicotine replacement therapy (NRT), and (3) referral to a phone-based counseling service. Trial enrollment began on September 1, 2014. At present, 142 patients had been enrolled in the trial across 8 sites. Compared to patients in the usual care arm, patients enrolled in the smoking cessation intervention arm were more likely to receive physician advice (98% versus 77%), a prescription for NRT (77% versus 13%) and quitline referral (93% versus 33%) (all p<0.001). While final results of the intervention on smoking cessation rates are still forthcoming, surgeon delivery of a brief, evidence-based smoking cessation intervention appears feasible for patients facing invasive vascular care.",
