  "title": "Rationale and Design of the CHAMP Trial Investigating the Therapeutic Mechanism of Mesenchymal Stromal Cells in the Treatment of Critical Limb Ischemia",
  "abstract": "Objective: Currently, there are no accepted nonsurgical therapies which improves the delivery of blood-derived nutrients to patients with critical limb ischemia (CLI). Here, we describe the ongoing phase I/II CHAMP trial, which will provide crucial evidence regarding the safety profile of mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) and explore their therapeutic mechanisms of in the setting of CLI requiring below-knee amputation (BKA).\n\nMethods: In the CHAMP and the parallel marrowCHAMP trials (hereafter grouped together as CHAMP), a total of 32 extremities with rest pain or tissue loss requiring BKA will be enrolled to receive intramuscular (IM) injections of allogeneic MSCs (CHAMP, n=16) or autogenous concentrated bone marrow aspirate (cBMA, marrowCHAMP, n=16) along the distribution of the BKA myocutaneous flap and proximal tibialis anterior. After treatment, subjects are randomized to BKA at four timepoints post-injection (days 3, 7, 14, 21). At the time of amputation, skeletal muscle is collected at 2 cm increments from the tibialis injection site and used to determine proangiogenic cytokine description, MSC retention, quantification of proangiogenic hematopoietic progenitor cells (PHCs), and histological description. Clinical limb perfusion pre- and post-treatment will be quantified using TcPO 2 , TBI, ABI, and indocyanine angiography (ICA). Additional clinical endpoints include all-cause mortality, need for amputation revision, and gangrene incidence during the 6-month post-treatment follow-up.\n\nResults: Enrollment is underway with ten patients treated per protocol thus far. We anticipate full conclusion of follow-up within the next 24 months.\n\nConclusion: CHAMP will be pivotal in characterizing the safety, efficacy, and most importantly, the therapeutic mechanism of allogeneic MSCs and autogenous cBMA in ischemic skeletal muscle.",
