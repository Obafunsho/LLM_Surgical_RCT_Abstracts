  "title": "AVG delamination: a cause of early cannulation arteriovenous graft dysfunction in hemodialysis patients",
  "abstract": "Background: A series of cases have reported graft delamination as a rare complication of early-cannulation arteriovenous graft (ecAVG). The unique multilayer structure of ecAVGs contributes to the property of cannulation as early as hours after implantation, but on other hand it takes the risk of graft delamination. However, the underlying mechanism and management of graft delamination as well as its effects on the long-term patency of ecAVGs have not been systemically analyzed.\n\nMethodsz: A retrospective study was conducted in a cohort of patients who required an ecAVG for hemodialysis (HD) access in our center between April 2017 and December 2021. The characteristics of graft delamination and the outcomes of its different treatments were analyzed.\n\nResults: A total of 144 ecAVGs were established in 141 end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients, including 124 (86.1%) Acuseal grafts and 20 (13.9%) Flixene grafts. During follow-up 24.5(11.5, 45.8) months, 11 (7.6%) subjects had graft infection with an incidence of 0.03 patient-year. Thirteen (9.0%) subjects had graft delamination at 9.3(5.0,12.4) months after ecAVG implantation, with an incidence of 0.04 per patient-year. ecAVG delamination was observed in both Acuseal grafts (0.037 per patient-year) and Flixene grafts (0.055 per patient-year). Thrombosis or venous hypertension was the most common complaints. Seven delamination was observed at 1.3 (0.1, 4.2) months after an endovascular procedure. The primary patency, primary assistant patency and secondary patency in delamination group were significantly lower than that in non-delamination group ( p < 0.05). Post-procedure primary patency of group A (percutaneous transluminal angioplasty, PTA), group B (stenting) and group C (partial graft replacement, PGR) were 1.3 (0.45,4.22) months, 5.3 (3.05,6.85) months and 8.45 (4.78,14.53) months respectively ( p = 0.029).\n\nConclusions: Graft delamination was not a rare complication of ecAVGs in this cohort. It significantly reduced the long-term patency of AVGs. PGR might be a more effective therapeutic way than endovascular treatments.",

  "full_text": "Methods\n\nStudy subjects\n\nThe retrospective study was conducted in a cohort of subjects who required an ecAVG for HD between April 2017 and December 2021 at the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, China. Follow-up ended on September 30, 2022, or access abandonment, patient death, or loss to follow-up. The study conformed to the ethical guidelines of Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the Human Research Ethics Committee of the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University. Anonymized patient data were used, thus obviating the need for informed consent.\n\nSubjects screening was shown in supplement S1 . 124 Acuseal grafts (Gore Medical; Newark, DE) or 20 Flixene grafts (Maquet-Atrium Medical, Hudson, NH), were implanted in patients who required early onset of HD. Acuseal graft was the first type of ecAVG used in our center and Flixene graft was introduced after graft delamination was observed. So, all the ecAVGs in the early stage of this study are Acuseal grafts and Flixene grafts mainly used in the later stage. Assessments before graft implantation included end stage renal disease (ESRD) life plan, clinical examinations, vein mapping by Doppler ultrasound (DUS), and venography.\n\nSurgical technique\n\nAll ecAVGs were established in the upper extremity, and both the arterial and venous puncture sites were located on the grafts. The procedures for establishing ecAVG were performed according to the standard surgical procedures, and no routine antiplatelet or anticoagulant drugs were used during the perioperative or follow-up period. All patients were routinely educated for self-monitoring of AVG function. Cannulation planning was conducted by vascular access nurse specialists.\n\nIn case of thrombosis, DUS was used to evaluate the lesions before procedures. After local anaesthesia, an antegrade 6 Fr sheath was placed on the arterial limb of the graft and another 6 Fr sheath was placed on the venous limb in retrograde direction under DUS guidance. Then, the thrombus was aspirated through the sheaths with syringes. Urokinase was administered into the access through the sheaths if needed. Thereafter, balloon angioplasty was performed to press the thrombus and treat underlining stenotic lesions. Angiography was performed to show the presence of thrombus plugs. This was followed by embolectomy with a 5.5 F embolectomy catheter. Balloon angioplasty and embolectomy were repeated until blood flow was restored, and all residual stenosis and thrombus were treated. The types and dosage of the thrombolytic agents, administration of anticoagulants, types and sizes of balloons, and length of balloons used during the procedures were done at the proceduralists’ discretion.\n\nPostoperative follow-up and definition of endpoint events\n\nAll subjects received a telephonic or on-site follow-up every 3 months until the end of follow-up. Hemodialysis parameters and cannulation condition were recorded at every follow-up visit, as well as physical examination, DUS examination or angiography was conducted if necessary. Surveillance data were reviewed by the multidisciplinary team to determine the indications of endovascular or surgical procedures, or access conversion according to the recommendations of KDOQI ­vascular access 2019 update [ 2 ].\n\nPrimary patency (intervention-free access survival) was defined as the interval between AVG creation and the first intervention for AVG dysfunction or thrombosis, the time of measurement of patency or the time of its abandonment. Assisted primary patency (thrombosis-free access survival) was defined as the interval between AVG creation and the first occlusion or measurement of patency including surgical or endovascular interventions to maintain the access. Secondary patency was defined as the interval between AVG creation and the abandonment of this access after one or more interventions or the time of measurement of patency including achievement of a censored event (death, change of HD modality, loss to follow-up). Post-procedure primary patency was defined as the interval between the index procedure and the next access thrombosis or reintervention [ 3 ].\n\nDiagnosis and treatment of ecAVG delamination\n\nThe diagnosis of delamination mainly relied on DUS examinations, which were performed using a Hitachi HI VISION Preirus system (5-13 MHz EUP-L74M linear array probe) or a Philips EPIQ Elite system (2-20 MHz eL18-4 linear array probe). The cross-section view showed that parts of the graft protruded into the lumen. The longitudinal view showed that the graft delaminated and in-folded into the lumen, with stagnant blood or thrombus within the false lumen. A multicoloured signal was demonstrated in the colour Doppler mode showing that blood flow was limited by the delamination. Typical images of graft delamination in DUS were shown in Figure 1(A) . Digital subtraction angiography (DSA) demonstrated an unusual filling defect within the delaminated segment of the graft. The filling defect disappeared after balloon dilation but relapsed shortly, shown in Figure 1(B) . Once this appearing-disappearing-relapsing shortly pattern of the filling defect on the early-cannulation graft during balloon angioplasty was observed, DUS examination was performed immediately to confirm whether there was a graft delamination. Graft delamination on a dissected graft was shown in Figure 1(C) .\n\nOnce delamination was observed, the location and length of the involved segment should be determined. According to the previous report and our experience, PTA, stenting, or partial graft replacement (PGR) were performed to salvage the ecAVG. Clinical information, date of delamination, cannulation complications, antecedent interventions, treatments of the delamination, and follow-up results were recorded in detail. Effects of different treatments on ecAVG patency were analyzed and compared.\n\nStatistical analysis\n\nData were extracted from the prospectively collected database. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS 23.0 software. The measurement data are expressed as the mean and standard deviation, the count data are expressed as the number of cases and percentages, and the normality was tested using the Kolmogorov–Smirnov method. The Kaplan–Meier method and the log-rank test were used for survival curve analysis. A value of p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.\n\nResults\n\nPopulation characteristics\n\nDemographics and characteristics of the subjects at the time of ecAVGs creation were shown in Table 1 . There were 144 ecAVGs created in 141 ESRD patients, including 124 (86.1%) Acuseal grafts and 20 (13.9%) Flixene grafts. These subjects were 56.4 ± 11.6 years old. The proportion of male patients was 49.3%, and the most common cause of ESRD was diabetes mellitus (34.7%). Most of the grafts connected upper arm brachial arteries and basilic veins with a loop configuration in the forearm. The initial cannulation was 2(1,4) days after implantation. The proportion of brachial artery as feeding artery in delamination group was lower than that in non-delamination group (76.9% vs. 96.9%, p = 0.016). No other statistically significant differences in demographics or characteristics were found between the two groups.\n\nClinical events\n\nDuring the follow-up period [24.5(11.5, 45.8) months], 25 subjects died (0.07 per patient-year), two subjects were lost to follow up, and other two subjects performed kidney transplantation. Eleven AVG infections (7.6%, 0.03 per patient-year) were observed in this cohort. The access was abandoned in one subject due to severe steal syndrome. During follow-up,100 (69.4%) patients received 405 interventions, including 190 (46.9%) ones due to thrombosis and the incidence of thrombosis was 0.6 per patient-year.\n\necAVG delamination\n\nDuring follow-up, 13 ecAVGs (9.0%) were diagnosed as graft delamination with an incidence of 0.04 per patient-year. The interval from graft implantation to the diagnosis of delamination was 9.3(5.0, 12.4) months. Seven (53.8%) delaminated ecAVGs had one or more endovascular procedures, and all the antecedent procedures were thrombectomy. The interval from the antecedent procedure to the diagnosis of delamination was 1.3 (0.1, 4.2) months. Thrombosis or elevated venous pressure was the main complaint of graft delamination. Most delamination occurred in the anterior wall of the graft in the venous limb. The characteristics, treatments, and outcomes of delamination are shown in S2. DUS or DSA images of every delaminated ecAVG are shown in Supplementary Figure S3 .\n\nEffects of delamination on ecAVG patency\n\nOn Kaplan-Meier analysis, the primary patency of all the ecAVGs in this cohort was 11.8 (95% confidence interval [CI], 9.9–13.7) months, as well as the primary patency rate was 49.8% and 28.3% at 12 and 24 months, respectively. The primary assistant patency of all the ecAVGs in this cohort was 22.8 (95% CI, 15.9–29.7) months, as well as the primary assistant patency rate was 70.8% and 48.9% at 12 and 24 months, respectively. The secondary patency of all the ecAVGs in this cohort was 47.9 (95% CI, 43.3–52.5) months, as well as the secondary patency rate was 85.9% and 72.5% at 12 and 24 months, respectively. Results were shown in Figure 2(A) . The primary patency in the delamination group was significantly lower than that in the non-delamination group[5.1(95%CI, 0.2–10.0) months vs. 12.6(95%CI, 8.7–16.5) months, p = 0.009] ( Figure 2(B) ); The primary assistant patency in the delamination group was significantly lower than that in the non-delamination group [10.4 (95% CI, 3.1–17.7) months vs. 25.7(95% CI, 15.4–35.0) months, p < 0.001] ( Figure 2(C) ). The secondary patency in the delamination group was significantly lower than that in the non-delamination group [34.3 (95% CI, 6.2–62.4) months vs. 50.3(95% CI, 44.4–56.2) months, p = 0.042]. Results were shown in Figure 2(D) .\n\nDifferent treatments for ecAVG delamination\n\nTwo delaminated ecAVGs did not receive any treatment, as there was no related clinical indicator and delamination did not progress during follow-up. One patient converted to AVF. The remaining 10 ecAVGs received 24 procedures to salvage ecAVGs, including PTA, stenting, and PGR. The characteristics and treatments of delamination were shown in S2. All the procedures post-delamination were divided into group A (PTA alone), group B (stenting), and group C (PGR) according to treatment modalities. Post-procedure primary patency of group A, group B and group C was 1.3 (0.45,4.22) months, 5.3 (3.05,6.85) months and 8.45 (4.78,14.53) months, respectively, ( p = 0.029) ( Figure 3(A) ). Post-procedure primary patency of group C was significantly better than group A ( p = 0.009), as shown in Figure 3(B) and Table 2 .\n\nDiscussion\n\nAVG delamination was reported as a rare complication of ecAVG [ 15–18 ]. In this study, we retrospectively analyzed clinical data of a cohort of 144 ecAVGs in our center and found that graft delamination had a much higher incidence in ecAVGs than previous reports. There were 13 ecAVGs (9.0%) were diagnosed as graft delamination with an incidence of 0.04 per patient-year. We also found that endovascular treatment could not get a satisfied patency.\n\nIn this cohort, ecAVG was conducted the first cannulation 2 days after graft implantation, and the use of ecAVG decreased the usage of catheter consistent with other studies [ 6 , 11 , 13 ]. Acuseal could be cannulated within 24 h and Flixene could be cannulated within 24 to 72 h due to their unique tri-layer structure design [ 9 , 10 ]. Unfortunately, this multilayer structure contributed to graft delamination which had been reported by several studies [ 15 , 17 ]. In a number of case reports, the incidence of Acuseal graft delamination was 4.7% to 5.1%, and the patency was not analyzed [ 15–19 ]. In this cohort, graft delamination wasn’t a rare complication, which had a comparable incidence of AVG infection (9% vs. 7.6%, or 0.04 vs. 0.03 patient-year). Delamination was observed in both Acuseal graft and Flixene graft. All delamination occurred between the middle layer and the superficial layer of ecAVGs and could be easily recognized under DUS imaging. The unusual filling defect of the ecAVG delamination during PTA under the guidance of X-ray was prone to be neglected unless it was examined by DUS. So, graft delamination should be carefully examined and excluded using a DUS before endovascular procedures.\n\nA delamination was formed when the luminal surface of a graft was disrupted by some processes, and blood entered a plane between layers and continued to separate the delaminated layers. Needle cannulation, sheath insertion, balloon dilation, continuous joint movements, and some other processes were found to be related to ecAVG delamination [ 15 , 17 ]. In this cohort, 7/13 (53.8%) delamination was observed shortly after an endovascular procedure, and they were thought to be related with sheath insertion or other endovascular process. Oversized balloons during PTA procedures would theoretically loose or disrupt the adhesion of multiple layers of ecAVGs. One delamination was limited to a short segment across elbow joint and was believed to be related to joint movements. Other five delamination was suspected to be related with cannulations. Cannulation of an AVG is different from an AVF, and the angle of needles for an AVG was bigger than AVF [ 3 ]. Some physicians or nurses lacked AVG cannulating experience and conducted a smaller angle when inserting sheathes or needles. Besides, the instructions of ecAVG usage advocate anterograde cannulation, but if the nurse follows the principle on the arterial side, she/he must change her/his position in a different direction, which was very inconvenient. So, incorrect cannulation also contributed to the occurrence of graft delamination. Additionally, ecAVG delamination could be observed during open thrombectomy although there was no delamination detected by DUS before the operation indicating that different layers of graft may delaminate spontaneously.\n\nDue to in-folding into the lumen and obstructing blood flow, delamination significantly reduced the patency of ecAVG. In this cohort, only 2 subjects with short segment delamination had little influence on blood flow and didn’t progress during follow-up. Other 11 delaminated ecAVGs presented thrombosis, venous hypertension, or difficult cannulation. Twenty-four procedures were conducted to salvage delaminated AVGs. PTA had a much lower patency than PGR. Stenting might improve the patency of delaminated grafts. Nevertheless, two delamination reoccurred at the distal edge of stent indicating that their entry tears hadn’t been covered, allowing blood to enter delaminated layers again. Similar results were demonstrated by previous reports [ 16–18 ] . So, finding and covering the entry tears of delaminated graft or replacing all the delaminated graft was crucial for the treatments.\n\nWe could not tell the difference of delamination which occurred on Flixene graft or Acuseal graft for there is only one delamination occurred on Flixene graft. It was on the venous limb crossing elbow joint, and it involved only a short segment of graft and had little influence on the ecAVG, and didn’t progress during follow-up, so had no indicator for intervention. 1of the 12 delamination which occurred on Acuseal graft had the similar condition to that occurred on Flixene graft.\n\nThe significance of this study was that it was the first one to systematically analyse the clinical characteristic, incidence, diagnostic criteria and management of graft delamination of ecAVGs. It also indicated that graft delamination was easily neglected under DSA imaging or during endovascular procedures, and it should be suspected especially when frequent reoccurrence after ecAVG endovascular treatments. The drawback of this study was the small sample size, and the short follow-up period. So, the results might have some bias. But considering it wasn’t a common complication of ecAVGs, it is difficult to get more cases.\n\nDespite its limitations, this study showed that graft delamination was an important but prone to be neglected complication of ecAVGs. It is important to conduct DUS examination to detect graft delamination before or during the endovascular procedures of ecAVGs. Graft delamination significantly reduced ecAVGs’ patency, and PGR might be a more effective therapeutic way than endovascular treatments.",
