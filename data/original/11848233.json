This is in part due to experimental evidence of AKI development despite normal or increased renal blood flow. 5\n\nDuring the beginning of the COVID‐19 pandemic, surges of patients were admitted to intensive care units (ICUs) and treated for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Concurrent development of AKI affected most patients and was associated with reduced chances of surviving. 6 A close relation in time between intubation and AKI development was demonstrated 6 and is consistent with the hypothesis that hemodynamic changes due to increased intrathoracic pressures and sedation could aggravate the loss of renal function. Whereas clinical studies of ARDS before COVID‐19 indicated the benefit of restricting intravenous fluid administration without increasing AKI incidence or severity 7 , 8 it was suggested that AKI in COVID‐19 was often caused by hypovolemia. Thus, meticulous care to prevent dehydration was recommended, often by treatment with intravenous fluids. 9\n\nOur group has previously assessed renal perfusion, oxygenation, and water content with multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI). 10 , 11 Using these methods, we demonstrated decreased renal perfusion in patients with critical COVID‐19 and AKI without a demonstrable reduction in renal oxygenation. 12 These results are in accordance with indirect estimations of renal blood flow demonstrating that reduced renal perfusion is more common in COVID‐19 ARDS than in non‐COVID‐19 ARDS patients and that this is in turn is associated with AKI development. 13 , 14 Renal hypo‐perfusion may, under certain conditions, in turn, be reversed by expanding a reduced circulating plasma volume even during normotension. 15 As renal autoregulation of blood flow is impaired during experimental studies of AKI in animals, there is a rationale to investigate whether AKI status impacts renal perfusion following plasma expansion. 16\n\nWe hypothesized that renal perfusion can be increased by intravenous fluid treatment in ICU patients, but that the effect may be different depending on whether AKI is present or not. The objective of this study was to compare the effects of plasma expansion with a standardized intravenous fluid bolus on renal perfusion and oxygenation assessed with mpMRI in patients with AKI compared to similar patients without AKI.\n\nMETHODS\n\nStudy design and declarations\n\nTo compare the immediate effects on renal perfusion of plasma expansion using a standardized fluid bolus between patients with or without AKI, a case–control study design was used to investigate group differences to a standardized intervention. Interventional data were evaluated using a before–after structure to limit study participants time in the MRI scanner without adding additional arms.\n\nThe study protocol was pre‐registered and is a sub‐study of the MR‐Evaluation of Renal Function In Septic Patients (MERSEP) (ClinicalTrials ID: NCT02765191 ). The study was first approved by the Uppsala Regional Ethical Review Agency, Uppsala, Sweden, No. 2014/381 and 2014/381/1 (Per Erik Nistér 2017‐02‐02) with amendments No. 2020‐01996 and No. 2021‐04798 approved by the Swedish Ethical Review Authority (Maria Wetterstrand Hagström 2020‐04‐24 and 2021‐10‐26). The Declaration of Helsinki and its subsequent revisions were followed.\n\nThe study was conducted at Uppsala University Hospital, a tertiary care center in Uppsala, Sweden. The main end‐point comparisons were predefined as between‐group differences of the change in renal perfusion assessed by mpMRI to a standardized fluid bolus between two groups of patients: with AKI or no/low grade AKI (AKI group and NO AKI group). Using data from healthy volunteers, group sizes of at least n = 8 were calculated to have a statistical power (1‐beta coefficient) of ≥0.8 and alpha coefficient ≤0.05 for a 10% within‐group difference in renal arterial blood flow if at least one kidney was measured. 17 All patients with at least one complete measurement of renal perfusion before and after fluid bolus from at least one kidney were included in the study.\n\nStudy protocol\n\nEligible patients admitted to the ICU were screened for inclusion. Inclusion criteria were AKI or risk of AKI development. Exclusion criteria were preexisting end‐stage renal failure or dialysis, contraindications for MRI (e.g., pace makers or certain metal implants), deterioration or instability in vital parameters to a degree where MRI was not feasible (e.g., prone positioning) and pregnancy. Informed consent was obtained from each patient or next of kin if the patient was unable to give consent. Group allocation was determined using the Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcome (KDIGO) Creatinine criteria only 18 due to the common occurrence of oliguria without a reduction of glomerular filtration. 19 Group allocation to the AKI group was determined as fulfillment of the KDIGO Creatinine criteria on the day of the MRI exam or within 12 h after the MRI exam. All other patients were assigned as NO AKI. Baseline Plasma (P)‐Creatinine was determined as the lowest value within a normal range during the previous 6 months up to mpMRI. Laboratory investigations were performed by the Department of Clinical Chemistry as in clinical practice, with at least daily measurement of P‐Creatinine during the ICU stay. Remaining medical data and history was collected from the electronic medical record.\n\nPatients were transported to the MRI by ICU staff and scanned supine on a 3T MR scanner (Achieva dStream, Philips Healthcare, Best, The Netherlands) with a 16‐channel torso phased array coil together with a spine coil. Patients were ventilated with a Maquet Servo‐i MR‐Conditional ventilator (Getinge AB, Sweden) during the MRI exam with the same modality and positive end‐expiratory pressure (PEEP) as before transport and fraction of inhaled oxygen (FiO 2 ), respiratory frequency and inspiratory pressures adjusted to maintain target blood oxygen saturation (SpO 2 ) and minute ventilation. Sedation regime and vasoactive treatment, when present, were continued throughout the MRI exam. Saturation with pulse oximetry and invasive arterial pressure was monitored continuously and recorded manually every 5 min. An initial scan containing perfusion imaging designed to be approximately 35–40 min in length was performed first. Results from the initial scan were included in a previous publication. 12\n\nAfter the initial scan, plasma expansion was achieved by rapid infusion of 7.5 mL/kg balanced crystalloid (Ringer's Acetate, Baxter) using a manual pressure infusion bag during 5–10 min. A new assessment of renal perfusion was initiated directly after the completion of fluid bolus administration, where regional perfusion assessed with Arterial Spin Labelling (ASL) was measured first (with a duration of approximately 4–8 min) followed by total renal perfusion using phase contrast imaging (PC). Following the perfusion measurement, the left renal vein saturation was measured using T2‐Relaxation‐Under‐Spin‐Tagging (TRUST) sequence. Last, a Blood Oxygen Level Dependent (BOLD) scan was performed. The BOLD effect is sensitive to hemodilution besides deoxyhemoglobin concentration and is expected to decrease relaxation rates in blood‐rich areas, such as renal cortex, if hemodilution is present. 20 The second exam was planned to have a duration of 15–20 min. The arithmetic mean of recorded mean arterial pressures (MAPs) during the first exam was compared with the arithmetic mean of MAPS after initiation of fluid bolus to assess hemodynamic response.\n\nPerfusion and oxygenation imaging\n\nA full description of the imaging and processing is described in the supplements of a previous publication. 12 Regional renal perfusion was measured using a respiratory‐triggered flow‐sensitive alternating inversion recovery (FAIR) ASL sequence. 21 An equilibrium magnetization (M0) image was collected. Post label delay (PLD) times of 400, 600, and 1800 ms were used with 5, 5, and 25 control/label image pairs collected at each PLD. 10 Both the ASL and T1‐mapping measures collected readouts at the end of expiration. ASL data were realigned to the equilibrium M 0 image, individual perfusion weighted difference images (control‐label) calculated, and averaged to create a perfusion‐weighted (Δ M ) average image per PLD. T1 maps were created on a voxel‐by‐voxel basis to a standard inversion recovery equation using in‐house Matlab (The MathWorks, Inc.) code after data was inspected for motion and discarded if necessary. Tissue perfusion ( f ) maps were calculated using Δ M from the longest PLD of 1800 ms (with maps generated both with and without an inflow time correction from the shorter PLDs), T1 maps, and equilibrium M0 maps. 10 T1b was assumed to be 1.55 s at 3 T, 22 while the blood‐tissue partition coefficient λ was assumed to be 0.8 mL/g for kidney perfusion maps. An inflow correction time was used to assess cortex perfusion, whereas those without were used to assess medullary perfusion. Binary whole kidney masks were created by manual segmentation followed by a histogram of T1 values across both kidneys where peaks were identified to separate renal cortex and medulla. These were applied to the perfusion maps and the peak perfusion value (in mL/100 g tissue/min) for each kidney was identified with a Gaussian fit.\n\nPhase contrast (PC)‐MRI was used to measure blood flow in each renal artery using a single slice ECG‐triggered turbo field echo. For each PC‐MRI acquisition, 20 measurements of blood flow across the cardiac cycle were collected during a single breath hold (15–20 s). PC‐MRI data of the renal arteries were analyzed using Segment software version 3.1 R8123 ( http://segment.heiberg.se ). 23 A region of interest was drawn around the vessel wall, and vessel tracking was used for automatic edge detection and propagation through all phases across the cardiac cycle to calculate blood flow velocity and vessel area. Renal artery blood flow (RABF) was then calculated as the mean flux of blood flow (in mL/min) over the cardiac cycle for each renal artery. Renal artery resistance index was determined bilaterally as ( V systole − V diastole )/ V systole where V is the velocity of the blood flow in the renal artery measured with PC‐MRI.\n\nTRUST data was acquired using a respiratory‐triggered FAIR‐based labeling scheme in a sagittal slice through the left renal vein. Analysis was performed in Matlab by subtracting each label from control at each effective echo time (TE) and averaging across repeats to generate the blood signal (Δ S (eTE)). Nine voxels with the greatest intensities within the vessel were averaged for each eTE and fit to Δ S (eTE) = S 0 exp.(eTE(1/T1b − 1/T2b)) where S0 is the signal intensity of pure venous blood, T1b is the T1 of blood (assumed to be 1624 ms), to calculate the T2 of blood (T2b). A calibration curve was used to determine venous saturation (Yv) from calculated T2b and individual hematocrit level. 24 Due to individual variation in hematocrit in response to the infusion, the R2 of blood (1/T2b), which is used in combination with hematocrit to calculate Yv, was also analyzed separately to eliminate between‐individual variations in hematocrit.\n\nStatistical analysis\n\nMeasurements from the renal mpMRI were evaluated using a repeated measure ANOVA within each kidney where each individual is considered a block. First, a mixed linear model was created where fluid bolus status, AKI status, and an interaction were used as fixed effects, whereas individual and kidney were used as random effects. Model fit was assessed using visual evaluation of residuals/fitted‐ and QQ‐plots. Where heteroscedasticity was considered prevalent, logarithmic transformation was used, and the new model was similarly reevaluated. Residuals were thereafter tested for normality using Shapiro‐Wilk's method and the model accepted if normality could not be refuted. The accepted model was analyzed using ANOVA type III with Kenward–Roger's method for determination of degrees of freedom. A significant effect of either fluid bolus status or interaction, refuted the null hypothesis of no effect of fluid bolus in neither AKI nor NO AKI group and was evaluated further using pairwise comparisons for effect of plasma expansion within each group with p ‐values adjusted using Tukey's method. p ‐values <.05 were considered significant. A sensitivity analysis was made post hoc in which hypertension and diabetes as dichotomous variables were added to the model. Estimated marginal means were used to determine the means and confidence intervals of mpMRI measurements presented in the paper. R studio 22.07.01 using R4.1.2 was used for statistical analysis with packages lme4 (1.1–27.1), lmerTest (3.1–3), and emmeans (1.7.0) using functions lmer, anova, and emmeans. Graphs were created using the ggplot2 (3.3.5) package. Continuous data is presented as mean (95% confidence interval) in the text if not stated otherwise.\n\nRESULTS\n\nSeventeen patients were enrolled between June 4, 2020 and May 10, 2021 and included in the analysis. At least one measurement of P‐Creatinine within the normal range during the current hospitalization prior to the MRI examination was present in all patients. Nine were allocated to the AKI group and eight to the NO AKI group. There were 67 valid measurements of total renal blood flow and cortical perfusion and 66 measurements of medullary perfusion. Patients had a mean age of 65 (59–71) years, of which 87% (14/17) were male. All patients had ARDS at the time of the scan and of at least moderate severity at some time during their ICU stay. All but one patient were treated with invasive ventilation during the scan, with a duration of 3.1 (2.3–3.9) days. Patients were generally circulatory stable with a mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 85 (79–91) mmHg and central venous saturation of 72% (68–76). Ten patients were treated with noradrenaline using doses of 0.04 (0.02–0.06) mcg/kg/min. Urine output the hour before the exam was 1.1 (0.8–1.5) mL/kg/h. Group‐wise characteristics are presented in Tables 1 and 2 .\n\nHemodynamic response\n\nPlasma expansion by the standardized fluid bolus generated an increase in mean arterial pressure and in a similar manner in both groups (Table 2 ). Bolus sizes administered were 712 (593–831) mL and 687 (545–828) mL in the AKI and NO AKI groups, respectively. In the group with AKI, MAP increased by 9 mmHg (0.5–18) and in the group without AKI, MAP increased by 15 mmHg (5–24). BOLD sequence during the last part of the scan demonstrated a significant reduction of cortical relaxation times in both AKI and NO AKI, consistent with hemodilution due to plasma expansion still being present after previous measurements (Table 2 ).\n\nRenal perfusion and oxygenation\n\nThere were no significant effects on total renal or cortical perfusion in neither of the groups (Figure 1A,B ) whereas a reduction in medullary perfusion was seen after plasma expansion in the group without AKI (Figure 1C ). Total renal blood flows were 321 mL/min/kidney (224–460) before plasma expansion and 331 mL/min/kidney (231–475) after in the AKI group (N.S.). In the NO AKI group, total renal blood flows were 395 mL/min/kidney (274–568) and 389 mL/min/kidney (270–560) before and after fluid infusion (N.S.). Cortical blood flows were 81 mL/min/100 g (CI 58–113) before infusion and 87 mL/min/100 g (62–121) after (N.S.) and in the patients without AKI, cortical perfusions were 139 mL/min/100 g (98–197) before infusion and 123 mL/min/kidney (87–174) after (N.S.). Renal medullary perfusions were reduced after plasma expansion in the NO AKI group, from 55 mL/min/100 g (39–79) to 34 mL/min/100 g (24–48) ( p = .0027) but unchanged in the AKI group, 32 mL/min/100 g (23–45) before and 33 mL/min/100 g (24–47) after (N.S.). In a sensitivity analysis made post hoc, in which hypertension and diabetes were added to the model, the results were not significantly different (Appendix S1 ).\n\nRenal venous R2 was similar before in both groups and did not decrease by fluid administration; however, there were missing data from four patients (of which three are missing in AKI group) due to poor image quality (Table 3 ). Renal resistive index was not influenced by plasma expansion in either of the groups (Table 3 ).\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nIn the present study, we have investigated the effects of acute plasma expansion on renal perfusion in critically ill patients with critical COVID‐19 and ARDS, and if the effects differ depending on AKI status. Our main findings are that renal perfusion and RABF did not increase after plasma expansion by a standardized balanced crystalloid bolus of 7.5 mL/kg, neither when AKI was present nor when it was not, despite generating significant increases in MAP. Also, renal medullary perfusion was lower after plasma expansion in the NO AKI group.\n\nNeither measurements with phase contrast nor ASL could demonstrate an increase in renal perfusion in any of the groups consisting of normotensive critically ill patients. Plasma expansion by crystalloid fluid infusion is often transient with prolonged half‐lives during hypovolemia or hypotension. 25 We assessed the renal perfusion shortly after completion of the fluid bolus when the plasma expansion likely still is present to attempt to circumvent this limitation. Further, the effects of plasma expansion were still detectable using the BOLD sequence at the end of the exam. BOLD is sensitive to deoxyhemoglobin besides hydration, but in the context of plasma expansion without changes in perfusion, present hemodilution is a probable explanation. 20 A previous randomized study comparing plasma expansion by either crystalloid or colloid fluid bolus in ICU patients after cardiac surgery demonstrated only a transient increase in RBF attenuated completely after 60 min. 26 In that study, larger fluid boluses were used: 20 mL/kg of crystalloid and 10 mL/kg of colloid. Larger bolus sizes than used in our study are not commonly used in clinical practice 27 in the ICU. The bolus size chosen in the present study thus emulates the plasma expansion reasonably achievable at the bedside during similar clinical conditions. Still, the smaller volumes used in the present study resulted in a similar difference in MAP than reported in the post‐operative patients. This is likely due to administration time being shorter in our study, which was intended to maximize the plasma volume expansion while limiting increases in fluid balance. Both phase contrast and ASL are valid non‐invasive measures of renal perfusion. 10 Using ASL, parts of our group have previously demonstrated a reduction in cortical perfusion in healthy volunteers by plasma expansion using 2 L of 0.9% saline compared with similar amounts of balanced crystalloid, 28 a finding described well in experimental studies. 29 Thus, when both phase contrast and cortical ASL cannot detect any significant change in renal perfusion, lack of effect is likely the cause.\n\nIn our study, renal medullary perfusion was reduced by plasma expansion in the NO AKI group but not in the AKI group, which was not an expected finding. We have previously used ASL to assess medullary perfusion. 11 , 12 , 17 The ASL sequence used here was optimized for measurement of cortical perfusion, and importantly, the medulla has comparatively low flow and therefore lower signal and relative precision. With some variation between species, there are differences in the autoregulation of medullary perfusion compared to total and cortical blood flows. 30 , 31 , 32 In rats, medullary autoregulation is reduced during normovolemia 32 compared with a fluid‐depleted state. Also, the influence of renal sympathetic nerve activity (RSNA) and circulating factors such as angiotensin II and vasopressin affects the cortical and medullary perfusion differently. During normal physiological conditions, RSNA is an external regulator of mainly total renal and cortical blood flow with only modest effects on medullary perfusion. 31 Angiotensin II increases medullary blood flow during certain conditions 33 whereas vasopressin mostly reduces medullary blood flow. 30 A possible explanation for this finding may be a temporary imbalance in the interplay between myogenic autoregulation, the effect of RSNA, and the distributive effects of Angiotensin II and vasopressin. Although we cannot present a probable mechanism for this finding that can explain the phenomenon in the NO AKI group solely, we note that a paradoxical decrease in renal medullary perfusion has been noted during a rapid increase in blood pressure during experimental conditions. 34 However, the limitations in the study design further elaborated below should also be considered before drawing further conclusions.\n\nIn a wider context, fluid bolus administration is a common intervention in the management of ICU patients with limited evidence to guide its proper use. Elevated or increasing P‐Creatinine, as well as mild oliguria, are still used as signs of hypovolemia 35 where fluid bolus administration is suggested and the expected beneficial effect is mediated by changing renal perfusion. Nevertheless, clinicians' expectations of hemodynamic and renal effects of fluid bolus administration often differ from actual effects. 36 During the completion of this study, a restrictive approach to fluid management has been recommended also in COVID‐19 27 based on previous findings in non‐COVID‐19 ARDS. 8 Furthermore, a previous study has demonstrated that in non‐COVID‐19 ARDS patients, an increase in cardiac index after fluid bolus administration did not correlate to a change in urine output. 37 Recent clinical trials focusing on the initial management of sepsis have not been able to demonstrate a beneficial effect on AKI development with liberal fluid protocols, 38 and beyond initial resuscitation, a recent trial in sepsis patients concluded that limiting fluid boluses to patients with more severe and non‐renal triggers did not result in an increase in mortality or the occurrence of severe AKI. 39 Also, in ICU patients, a fluid restrictive regime may reduce the use of CRRT when AKI is present. 40 The lack of an increase in renal perfusion seen by plasma expansion in the patients included in our study may further the understanding of the apparent lack of clinical benefit in the studies referred to above.\n\nA limitation of the present study is that severely hypovolemic patients with a resulting circulatory instability were not included in the study. As such, conclusions cannot be made about the effects of plasma expansion on renal perfusion during initial resuscitation and stabilization. This is a common problem in studies where renal blood flow estimation is not readily available bedside. Our study did not include assessment by echocardiography or direct measurement of cardiac output, and the effect on cardiac output by plasma expansion may not have been increased despite MAP elevation. 37 Also, an increase in central venous pressure by plasma expansion may attenuate the increase in renal perfusion pressure. Still, improvement of hemodynamic variables in general (reduced HR and increased MAP) is a common end point in clinical practice. 36 We acknowledge that the before–after design is susceptible to bias, including regression to the mean bias.\n\nIn conclusion, renal perfusion was not increased shortly after plasma expansion by a standardized fluid bolus of 7.5 mL/kg Ringer's Acetate in normotensive critically ill COVID‐19 patients with AKI or without AKI, respectively.\n\nAUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS\n\nTL, PE, SF, JW, FP, ML, PL, and RF contributed to the conception and design of the study.
