  "abstract": "Objective:: We sought to evaluate symptomatic adverse event (AE) rates among patients with pancreatic cancer receiving neoadjuvant therapy on clinical trial (A021501) using the Patient-Reported Outcomes Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (PRO-CTCAE).\n\nSummary Background Data:: To date, pancreatic cancer clinical trials have measured AEs using standard physician reporting (CTCAE). Patient-reported symptomatic AEs have been incompletely characterized.\n\nMethods:: A021501 (Dec 31, 2016-Jan 1, 2019) randomized patients with borderline resectable pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma to 8 doses of mFOLFIRINOX (Arm 1) or 7 doses of mFOLFIRINOX + hypofractionated radiotherapy (Arm 2), followed by pancreatectomy and adjuvant FOLFOX6. Patients completed PRO-CTCAE assessments at baseline, on day 1 of each chemotherapy cycle, and daily during radiotherapy.\n\nResults:: Of 126 patients, 96 (76%) initiated treatment and completed a baseline plus at least 1 post-baseline PRO-CTCAE assessment. Diarrhea and fatigue were the only symptomatic grade 3 or higher AEs identified in at least 10% of patients using CTCAE. At least 10% of all patients reported an adjusted PRO-CTCAE composite grade 3 AE during neoadjuvant treatment for 10 of 15 items: anxiety (10%), bloating of abdomen (16%), decreased appetite (18%), diarrhea (13%), dry mouth (21%), fatigue (36%), nausea (18%), generalized pain (16%), abdominal pain (21%), and problems tasting (32%). Decreased appetite was higher in Arm 2 than in Arm 1 ( P =0.0497); no other differences between study arms were observed.\n\nConclusions:: Symptomatic AEs during neoadjuvant therapy were common and were reported more frequently by patients using PRO-CTCAE than were recorded by clinicians using standard CTCAE.\n\nMINI-ABSTRACT: We sought to evaluate patient-reported symptomatic adverse event rates among patients with borderline-resectable pancreatic cancer receiving neoadjuvant therapy on clinical trial (A021501). Symptomatic adverse events during neoadjuvant therapy were common and were reported more frequently by patients compared to standard clinician reporting.",
