  "title": "Effects of Dexmedetomidine on Postoperative Quality of Recovery and Electroencephalogram in Elderly Patients Undergoing Total Knee Arthroplasty: A Randomized Clinical Trial",
  "abstract": "Purpose: Anesthesia management strategies in elderly patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty (TKA) are critical to the postoperative quality of recovery (QoR), and changes in electroencephalogram (EEG) associated with anesthesia drugs may play an important role in this process. This study aimed to determine the effects of different doses of dexmedetomidine on postoperative QoR in elderly TKA patients, and whether there is a correlation with specific EEG changes.\n\nMethods: In this randomized controlled trial, elderly patients (aged ≥ 60 years) undergoing elective TKA were randomly allocated in a 1:1:1 ratio to 0.6 μg/kg/h dexmedetomidine (Group D2), 0.3 μg/kg/h dexmedetomidine (Group D1) and saline (Group N). On postoperative days 1 and 3, the15-item Quality of Recovery (QoR-15) scale was used to evaluate the postoperative recovery of patients among the three groups. Perioperative EEG data were also recorded.\n\nResults: The difference of QoR-15 scores on postoperative day 1 was significant for Group D2 vs Group N (126 [123–129] points vs 120 [116–123] points; median difference, 6 points [95% CI, 4 to 8]; P < 0.001) and Group D2 vs Group D1 (126 [123–129] points vs 122 [118–126]; median difference, 4 points [95% CI, 2 to 5]; P = 0.001), but not for Group D1 vs Group N. However, no significant difference was observed in the global and dimensional QoR-15 scores on postoperative day 3 among the three groups. Intraoperative EEG power spectra analysis revealed a decrease in α oscillation peak power and an increase in slow oscillation peak power in Group D1 and Group D2, compared with Group N. In addition, the slow oscillation peak power exhibited weak positive correlations with QoR-15 scores on postoperative day 1 (r = 0.319, P < 0.001).\n\nConclusion: A loading dose of dexmedetomidine (0.5 μg/kg) infused within 10 minutes before anesthesia induction, followed by a maintenance at 0.6 μg/kg/h, improved QoR-15 on postoperative day 1 in elderly TKA patients, which may be partly related to the fact that dexmedetomidine deepens anesthesia by increasing the slow oscillation peak power in the appropriate range.",

Furthermore, the elderly patients are sensitive to operation-induced stress due to significant reductions in organ reserve and compensatory capacity, and often experience early postoperative complications, such as pain, sleep disturbances and anxiety, 2 , 3 which could seriously affect the quality of recovery (QoR). How to improve postoperative life quality and perform functional exercises as early as possible in elderly patients remains an important challenge and a hot issue of concern for clinicians. 4\n\nDexmedetomidine is a highly selective α-2 adrenergic agonist with dose-dependent sedative, analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects. 5 Perioperative application of dexmedetomidine may benefit in mitigating surgical stress and inflammatory response, improving N3 sleep in a dose-dependent manner, 6–10 and has been shown to improve postoperative QoR in adult patients during various surgeries. 7 , 11–15 However, the effect of dexmedetomidine on the QoR after TKA in the elderly and the mechanisms involved have not been fully elucidated.\n\nFurthermore, dexmedetomidine is clinically infused in a wide range of rates and electroencephalogram (EEG) characteristics varied with doses. When infused with dexmedetomidine at a low dose, the EEG is characterized by spindle oscillation, 16 which is a general term for spindle-like activity (12–16 Hz oscillation, lasting 1–2 seconds) and slow-wave activity during dexmedetomidine-induced sedation. Purdon et al showed that the higher the rate of dexmedetomidine infusion, the greater the amplitude of slow oscillations. 17 We previously demonstrated that dexmedetomidine can enhance propofol or sevoflurane anesthesia, while increasing slow-wave power and decreasing the frequency of each brain wave segment. 18 , 19 However, the dose-response data of dexmedetomidine and its EEG-recovery correlation in elderly TKA patients remain unclear.\n\nThis study aimed to explore the effects of different doses of dexmedetomidine on postoperative QoR in elderly patients undergoing TKA. An additional purpose of the study was to preliminarily investigate whether there is an association between the EEG changes induced by dexmedetomidine and postoperative QoR.\n\nMaterials and Methods\n\nStudy Setting and Population\n\nEthical approval for this study (Approval number: PJ 2022–13-12) was provided by the Ethical Committee of the First Affiliated Hospital of Anhui Medical University on 9 November 2022. This study has been registered at Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (ChiCTR2200066337) on 1 December 2022. This single-center randomized clinical trial was performed at a tertiary hospital in China between December 2022 and June 2023. The study was conducted in adherence to the principles outlined in the Declaration of Helsinki and written informed consent for study participation was obtained from all patients before enrollment. This study followed the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) reporting guideline. 20 Patients aged 60 years or older undergoing elective TKA with American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status 1 to 3 were eligible to participate. Exclusion criteria included serious bradycardia (resting heart rate [HR] < 50 bpm), allergy to trial-related medications, severe hepatic or renal dysfunction, dementia or treatment with antipsychotic agents and inability to complete scale assessment.\n\nRandomization and Blinding\n\nEligible patients were randomly divided on a 1:1:1 ratio into three groups: low-dose dexmedetomidine group (Group D1), high-dose dexmedetomidine group (Group D2), and normal saline group (Group N). A randomized sequence was generated using random numbers from the SAS statistical package version 9.3 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA). A researcher who was not involved in the study prepared the study agents in identical 50 mL syringes based on the treatment protocol information contained within sequentially numbered sealed envelopes. The patients, investigators, responsible anesthesiologists, surgeons, and scale assessors were blinded to the intervention throughout the study period.\n\nTo minimize potential bias during EEG analysis, a rigorous blinding procedure was implemented. The analysts remained blinded to group allocation, clinical outcomes, and perioperative variables throughout feature extraction, quantitative EEG analysis, and statistical interpretation.\n\nProtocol and Intervention\n\nDuring the preoperative assessment, we collected baseline data include demographic characteristics, diseases history and QoR scores. Standard monitoring was initiated upon arrival in the operating room, which included electrocardiography, HR, pulse oxygen saturation (SpO 2 ), mean arterial pressure (MAP) and end-tidal carbon dioxide partial pressure (ETCO 2 ). A four-channel sensor was attached to specific locations on the patient’s forehead: Fp1, Fp2, F7, and F8; earth electrode at Fpz; reference electrode approximately 1 cm above Fpz. For each electrode, impedance was maintained below 5 kΩ. Frontal EEG data, including patient state index (PSI), were recorded using a Sedline ® brain function monitor (Masimo Corporation, Irvine, CA, USA) 21 at a sampling rate of 178 Hz.\n\nConsidering that elderly patients are often received anticoagulant therapy, accompanied by hyperostosis and narrow intervertebral space, it is unsuitable or difficult to obtain epidural puncture. In addition, with the decline of organ function reserve, intraspinal anesthesia is prone to cause significant hemodynamic fluctuations due to sympathetic block. Therefore, general anesthesia combined with nerve block is the preferred anesthesia for elderly patients undergoing TKA in our institution.\n\nPatients in Group D1 and Group D2 received a loading dose of dexmedetomidine (0.5 μg/kg) within 10 minutes before anesthesia induction, followed by continuous pumping of dexmedetomidine at 0.3 μg/kg/h and 0.6 μg/kg/h, respectively. The specific dose of dexmedetomidine was determined by referring to previous similar studies 22 , 23 and considering the decreased tolerance and increased sensitivity to the drug in elderly patients. Correspondingly, patients in Group N were administered an equivalent volume of normal saline infused at the same rates. Intravenous anesthesia was induced using propofol (1.5–2.0 mg/kg) and sufentanil (0.2–0.4 μg/kg). When the PSI decreased below 50, cisatracurium (0.2 mg/kg) was administered. Assisted breathing was performed for 3 minutes, and then laryngeal mask airway was inserted and mechanical ventilation was performed. Then, ultrasound-guided femoral nerve block (0.33% ropivacaine 15–20 mL) and sciatic nerve block (0.33% ropivacaine 20–25 mL) were performed following the experienced anesthesiologists.\n\nDuring anesthesia maintenance, propofol and remifentanil were continuously administered at 3–6 mg/kg/h and 0.05–0.2 μg/kg/min, respectively. The propofol infusion dose was increased or decreased on a gradient of 0.3 mg/kg/h each time to maintain a PSI of 25–50. Flurbiprofen (50 mg) and local infiltration analgesia with ropivacaine (100 mg, 10 mL) and NaCl (0.9%, 10 mL) were administered before incision closure. Intraoperative vasoactive drugs were applied to maintain MAP within ± 20% of the baseline and HR within 50–100 bpm.\n\nAfter the operation, all patients were transferred to the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) for recovery. The laryngeal mask was removed once the patient regained consciousness from anesthesia and demonstrated adequate tidal volume and stable hemodynamic parameters. Nurses assessed pain at rest using numerical rating scale (NRS) every 5 minutes during the PACU. Patients with NRS score ≥ 4 received sufentanil 0.1 μg/kg as needed. When the vital signs were stable and the Steward recovery score was > 4, the patients were transferred to the general ward for standardized postoperative care and rehabilitation. 24\n\nWith strict adherence to drug use contraindications, attending physicians used multimodal nonsteroidal internal analgesics and opioids to maintain NRS scores < 4 and followed structured criteria: 25–27 For patients with NRS ≥ 4, oral selective cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitors are preferred; If oral administration is not convenient, intravenous flurbiprofen axetil or intramuscular diclofenac sodium lidocaine injection can be selected. When the NRS score ≥ 7, opioid analgesics were added. Oral oxycodone was the first choice. Tramadol intramuscular injection was given if adverse reactions such as intractable vomiting occurred. Transdermal patches, including transdermal buprenorphine and transdermal fentanyl, were used as needed if contraindications to tramadol, such as convulsions, occurred. This multimodal regimen follows the principle of balanced analgesia with optimized efficacy and safety.\n\nData Collection\n\nThe primary outcome was the difference in QoR scores on postoperative day 1 (POD1) measured by the 15-item Quality of Recovery (QoR-15) scales, 28 which designed to evaluate five dimensions: physical comfort, physical independence, psychological support, pain and emotional state. The total score ranges from 0 (poorest QoR) to 150 (best QoR).\n\nThe secondary outcome was perioperative EEG analysis. We further assessed the relationship between the characteristics of EEG waveforms and QoR-15 scores on POD1. In addition, QoR-15 scores on POD3, the type and dose of analgesics used on POD1, incidence of intraoperative tourniquet hypertension, 29 , 30 changes in perioperative MAP, HR, and PSI values, the administration of vasoactive drugs and intraoperative adverse events (including hypotension, hypertension and bradycardia) were recorded.\n\nSample Size and Statistical Analysis\n\nA difference of 6 points in the QoR-15 scores for perioperative interventions was recently recommended as a minimum clinically important difference. 31 Based on pre-pilot data, the average QoR-15 scores on POD1 for Group N, Group D1, and Group D2 were 118, 123, and 128, respectively. And standard deviation (SD) within the group were 7, 6 and 2, respectively. Setting an α of 0.017 (two sided), 32 a test efficacy of 0.9 and a dropout rate of 10%, we planned to enroll 225 patients.\n\nThe Shapiro–Wilk test was employed to confirm the normality of the data. Interval data were expressed as mean ± SD or median (interquartile range) depending on the normality of the data and compared using one-way analysis of variance or Kruskal–Wallis test. Categorical variables were expressed as numbers and percentages and compared using the Pearson χ 2 test. The P value was adjusted according to Bonferroni post hoc testing and fixed at 0.017 for pairwise comparison. The median difference and 95% confidence interval (CI) on primary outcomes were calculated to analyze the effect of dexmedetomidine on improving the QoR after TKA.\n\nThe EEG data were processed using MATLAB 2021b (The MathWorks, Natick, MA, USA). 21 Based on the information obtained from the EEG power spectrum analysis, a segment of consecutive 120-seconds EEG data was selected and the power spectrum was computed by the multi-taper spectral estimation method implemented by the Chronux toolbox. 33 Concurrently, frontal spectrograms were generated from the EEG data of representative patients in each group for comparison. And we calculated the α and slow oscillatory peak power for each patient. Linear regression analyses were used to explore the relationship between QoR-15 scores on POD1 and EEG waveforms. All statistical analyses were conducted using SPSS version 24.0 (SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) and 2-sided P < 0.05 were considered statistically significant.\n\nResults\n\nDemographic and Clinical Characteristics of the Patients\n\nFrom December 2022 to June 2023, of 285 patients screened for eligibility, 225 were enrolled and randomly assigned to one of the three groups (75 patients per group) ( Figure 1 ). Twelve patients who were lost to follow-up were excluded and nine patients due to termination of intervention were removed from the trial. The remaining 204 patients were included in the data analysis (68 patients per group). After screening and eliminating EEG data by uniform criteria, EEG power spectral analysis was performed in 198 patients (64 in Group N, 67 in Group D1, and 67 in Group D2).\n\nDemographic data were comparable among the three groups ( Table 1 ). There were no differences in the duration of surgery and anesthesia, or the total volume administered. The propofol dosage was significantly reduced in Group D1 (414.2 ± 83.1 mg vs 456.6 ± 112.3 mg; P = 0.013) and Group D2 (396.8 ± 105.2 mg vs 456.6 ± 112.3 mg; P = 0.001) compared with Group N. The difference in tourniquet hypertension incidence was across groups (Group D2, 0 patient; Group D1, 5 patients [7.4%]; Group N, 16 patients [23.5%]; P < 0.001). However, no difference in intraoperative adverse events or length of stay was found among the three groups.\n\nPrimary Outcome\n\nThe median points in the global QoR-15 scores (Group N, 120 [116–123]; Group D1, 122 [118–126]; Group D2, 126 [123–129]; P < 0.001) as well as the scores of the three dimensions, including physical comfort (Group N, 43 [40–45]; Group D1, 44 [41–47]; Group D2, 48 [44–50]; P < 0.001), pain (Group N, 17 [15–17]; Group D1, 17 [15–18]; Group D2, 17 [17–18]; P = 0.002), and emotional state (Group N, 37 [36–38]; Group D1, 38 [38–38]; Group D2, 38 [38–38]; P < 0.001) were significantly difference among the three groups on POD1 ( Table 2 ). Post hoc analyses showed that there was a significant improvement in the QoR-15 scores of POD1 in Group D2 compared with Group N (median difference, 6 points [95% CI, 4 to 8 points]; P < 0.001) and Group D1 (median difference, 4 points [95% CI, 2 to 5 points]; P = 0.001), while the difference was not statistically significant between Group D1 and Group N (median difference, 3 points [95% CI, 1 to 5 points]; P = 0.018).\n\nSecondary Outcomes\n\nPreoperative EEG power spectrum analysis including the α and slow oscillation peak power were similar among the three groups ( Figure S1 in supplementary material ). As depicted in Figure 2 , intraoperative power spectra analysis revealed that the slow oscillation peak power increased in Group D2 (4.2 ± 0.3 dB vs 3.4 ± 0.3 dB; P = 0.001) and Group D1 (4.0 ± 0.3 dB vs 3.4 ± 0.3 dB; P = 0.005) while the α oscillation peak power decreased in Group D2 (0.7 ± 0.1 dB vs 0.9 ± 0.1 dB; P < 0.001) and Group D1 (0.7 ± 0.1 dB vs 0.9 ± 0.1 dB; P < 0.001) compared with Group N. No significant difference was observed between Group D1 and Group D2 in EEG power spectra. However, there were no difference in the α and slow oscillation peak power among the three groups during recovery period ( Figure S2 in supplementary material ). Consequently, the α and slow oscillation peak power in the preoperative, intraoperative, and recovery periods, respectively, were selected for correlation with the global QoR-15 scores on POD1 ( Figure 3 ). Linear regression analysis revealed that the intraoperative slow oscillation peak power had weak positive correlations with the QoR-15 scores on POD1 (r = 0.319, P < 0.001).\n\nNo significant difference was observed in the global and dimensional QoR-15 scores on POD3 among the three groups. The utilization of flurbiprofen axetil on POD1 differed among the three groups (47 patients [69.1%] vs 42 patients [61.8%] vs 33 patients [48.5%]; P = 0.046), and no significant difference was observed in the consumption of other analgesics ( Table S1 in supplementary material ).\n\nFurthermore, better hemodynamic status was observed in patients allocated to Group D1 and Group D2, compared with patients allocated to Group N ( Figure 4 ). Intraoperative vasoactive drug use was presented in Table S2 in supplementary material . There was no significant difference among the three groups in the use of atropine and ephedrine. In terms of norepinephrine use, it was significantly lower in Group D1 (2 patients [2.9%] vs 12 patients [17.6%]; P = 0.005) and Group D2 (1 patients [1.5%] vs 12 patients [17.6%]; P = 0.001) compared to Group N.\n\nDiscussion\n\nIn this randomized clinical trial, elderly patients receiving 0.6 μg/kg/h dexmedetomidine had superior recovery on POD1, especially in the three dimensions of physical comfort, pain, and emotional state compared with patients receiving saline and 0.3 μg/kg/h dexmedetomidine. From the perspective of EEG power spectrum analysis, the application of dexmedetomidine at different doses increased the slow oscillation peak power, and correlation analyses showed a weak positive correlation between intraoperative slow oscillation peak power and QoR-15 scores on POD1. In addition, dexmedetomidine infusion at 0.6 μg/kg/h also reduced the incidence of tourniquet hypertension.\n\nThe QoR-15 scale consists of 5 dimensions, and patients receiving 0.6 μg/kg/h dexmedetomidine in this study scored better in physical comfort, pain and emotional state on POD1. Due to the severe trauma caused by TKA, adverse consequences including pain and sleep disturbances remain important factors affecting postoperative recovery. 34 , 35 Grosu et al found that approximately 58% of TKA patients experienced moderate to severe pain on POD1. 34 Moreover, acute sleep disturbances after TKA can last for a long time. 35 , 36 Intraoperative application of dexmedetomidine was considered to mitigate postoperative pain by reducing inflammatory mediators and substance P induced by surgical trauma. 37 , 38 Furthermore, voltage-gated sodium channels in the dorsal horn have been shown to be critical in pain transmission. 39 , 40 These studies have also shown that dexmedetomidine inhibits sodium channels. This means that the drug can modulate pain and perception through the locus coeruleus and dorsal horn, while also affecting pain transmission and conduction, thereby broadening its analgesic efficacy. Dexmedetomidine at 0.6 μg/kg/h was also effective in improving the patient’s sleep quality on POD1, consistent with previous reports indicating that a specific dose of dexmedetomidine may ameliorate postoperative sleep disturbances. 41 , 42 Then, better postoperative emotional state scores were attributed to satisfactory postoperative analgesia and improved sleep quality. 43 , 44\n\nNevertheless, there were no differences on the physical independence and psychological support dimensions among the three groups on POD 1. In the early stage after TKA, especially within 24 hours, elderly patients commonly experience knee swelling, pain, muscle weakness, and limited mobility. 45 These physiological constraints significantly impede the expression of physical independence in the QoR-15 scale, leaving patients with relatively poor abilities in independent activities during this period. This widespread functional limitation may lead to scores of this dimension clustering at the lower end of the scale, resulting in a floor effect. Additionally, this study adopted single-center standardized perioperative management, where all patients received consistent care procedures and communication patterns, and all had access to family companionship and support. This may have diminished the discriminability of intergroup differences in the dimension of psychological support. Notably, dexmedetomidine had no effect on QoR-15 scores on POD3. This finding might be related to the timing and dosage of dexmedetomidine used, the standardized postoperative care and well-established analgesic protocol after surgery.\n\nInfluenced by many factors such as patient age, surgical stimulation, drug concentration and physiological state, 46 the reliability of processing EEG-derived metrics (PSI) for depth of anesthesia monitoring is questionable. We therefore further analyzed the EEG waveforms of patients and found that the combination of dexmedetomidine and propofol elicited larger slow oscillations and increased the slow oscillation peak power. Meanwhile, correlation analysis showed a weak positive correlation between intraoperative slow oscillation peak power and QoR-15 scores on POD1. These results indicated that deepening anesthesia within an appropriate range could promote postoperative recovery to some extent. Studies have shown that slow oscillations during non-rapid eye movement sleep play a pivotal role in sleep homeostasis and higher cognitive function. 47 , 48 In addition, dexmedetomidine-induced modulation of slow-wave activity has been demonstrated to be an EEG marker of anesthesia-induced metabolic inhibition, which allows brain cells to take a full rest. 49 Accordingly, dexmedetomidine may be beneficial in restoring higher cognitive function and quality of life in elderly patients after surgery by deepening anesthesia and suppressing the stress response. However, the weak correlation between intraoperative slow oscillation peak power and QoR-15 scores on POD1 may be attributed to many factors affecting the quality of postoperative recovery, and the changes in brain electrical activity are only part of the mechanism by which dexmedetomidine improves postoperative QoR.\n\nNotably, continuous infusion of low-dose dexmedetomidine (0.3 μg/kg/h) improved EEG parameters, such as slow oscillatory power, but did not significantly improve the quality of recovery after surgery compared with patients receiving normal saline. This may stem from the fact that EEG changes reflect only the neurophysiological effects of the drug, whereas clinical recovery results from a combination of factors such as inflammation, pain, and sleep. Low-dose dexmedetomidine may not provide sufficient anti-inflammatory or analgesic effects to translate changes in EEG waveforms into measurable improvements in QoR-15 scores, especially in elderly TKA patients with strong surgical stress.\n\nIt is worth mentioning that patients in the dexmedetomidine groups used significantly less propofol. To some extent, it means that continuous intravenous infusion of dexmedetomidine can induce deeper anesthesia in elderly patients undergoing general anesthesia, which is consistent with our previous findings that dexmedetomidine enhances the effect of propofol anesthesia by increasing the strength of slow wave oscillations. 18 This was also confirmed by the decrease in PSI. Although there was no significant difference in PSI among the three groups in this study, the average PSI in the saline group was still higher than that in the dexmedetomidine groups. This slight difference in the depth of anesthesia may affect the intraoperative slow wave oscillation power and α oscillation power, resulting in an increase in the peak slow wave oscillation power and a decrease in the peak α oscillation power in the dexmedetomidine groups. Future studies can focus on the effects of dexmedetomidine combined with propofol on more accurate changes in intraoperative slow wave oscillation power and alpha oscillation power under the same anesthesia depth and similar balance of cerebral oxygen supply and demand.\n\nDexmedetomidine inhibits sympathetic excitation, predisposing to hypotension and bradycardia. In addition, dexmedetomidine similarly activate peripheral α2-adrenergic receptors, leading to transient hypertension. 50 , 51 However, there was no significant difference in these adverse events among the three groups in our study. And the hemodynamic changes were more stable in patients who received dexmedetomidine compared to those who received saline. These results may stem from the relatively conservative dose of dexmedetomidine used in this study and the relatively strict exclusion criteria that excluded patients with severe bradycardia. Moreover, it has been shown that the anti-inflammatory properties of dexmedetomidine can reduce the release of proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-6 and TNF-α, 52 which is essential for preventing complications such as infection and delayed healing after joint replacement surgery. Considering the utilization of tourniquets during TKA and the positive effect of dexmedetomidine in reducing the stress response, we paid close attention to the incidence of intraoperative tourniquet hypertension. As expected, patients treated with dexmedetomidine during surgery had a significantly lower incidence of tourniquet hypertension compared to patients receiving saline. Moreover, all patients underwent well-established regional block techniques including femoral and sciatic nerve blocks preoperatively, which may have contributed to the lower incidence of tourniquet hypertension in the dexmedetomidine group in our study compared to previous studies. 30 , 53\n\nThis study has several limitations. First, our study showed that dexmedetomidine at 0.6 μg/kg/h was superior to dexmedetomidine at 0.3 μg/kg/h and saline in improving the QoR on POD1; however, the optimal dose of dexmedetomidine needs to be further explored and investigated. Second, the lack of data on postoperative delirium remains a limitation of this study, despite the fact that our main observation was the quality of postoperative recovery. Finally, the study was conducted in a single center and was not representative of the wider population, limiting the generalizability of the findings.\n\nConclusions\n\nThis study demonstrated that intravenous infusion of a loading dose of dexmedetomidine (0.5 μg/kg) within 10 min before anesthesia induction, followed by a maintenance infusion of 0.6 μg/kg/h dexmedetomidine improved the QoR on POD 1 in elderly TKA patients compared with 0.3 μg/kg/h dexmedetomidine and saline. Furthermore, dexmedetomidine deepened the depth of anesthesia by increasing the slow oscillation peak power in the appropriate range, which partially correlated with improved QoR-15 scores on POD1. This study provides valuable anesthesia strategies for elderly patients with TKA to improve the postoperative QoR. Future studies can verify the results across a wider patient sample and further explore how to improve postoperative recovery quality in elderly patients based on EEG changes.",
