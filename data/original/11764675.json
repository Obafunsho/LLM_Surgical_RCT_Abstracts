  "abstract": "Objective: This study evaluates hemodynamic and anatomic changes in great saphenous vein (GSV) tributaries after endovenous laser ablation (EVLA).\n\nMethods: This case series analyzed 112 areas in 28 lower limbs of 25 patients who underwent EVLA from April 2022 to June 2023 at the Hospital das Clínicas de Pernambuco/UFPE. All patients were evaluated by Doppler ultrasound preoperatively and 3 months after the surgical treatment. The parameters studied were GSV diameter and patency, GSV tributary diameter, patency and flow direction, and the Venous Clinical Severity Score after EVLA.

We analyzed 101 GSV tributaries. In the analysis of GSV tributaries by area, we identified a mean diameter decrease in all groups of tributaries ( P < .001). Considering the tributaries with reflux, we also identified a reduction in the number of tributaries with reflux in all four groups ( P ≤ .001).

It was analyzed 112 areas in 28 lower limbs of 25 patients, who underwent EVLA at the Vascular Surgery Service of the Hospital das Clínicas/EBSHER – UFPE from April 2022 to June 2023.\n\nThe study included symptomatic adult patients with chronic venous disease of lower limbs, classified as C2 to C5 in the Clinical-Etiology-Anatomy-Pathophysiology classification (CEAP), with GSV and saphenous-femoral junction (SFJ) reflux of >500 m/s at Doppler ultrasound (DUS) examination. Patients with deep vein thrombosis, absence of distal pulses, and who lost clinical and ultrasound follow-up in the postoperative period were excluded.\n\nThe intervention was performed in four stages after obtaining the patient's informed consent. In stage 1, we performed the clinical evaluation, DUS mapping, and applied the Venous Clinical Severity Score (VCSS) questionnaire. 12 The examination of the lower limbs was conducted in an orthostatic position with GE Logic E and F7 devices, with 12L-RS linear transducers from General Electric; the mapping of the superficial system was carried out following the Consensus and Recommendations of the Brazilian Society of Angiology and Vascular Surgery in 2019. 13 The GSV characteristic was evaluated in four regions: SFJ, medium thigh, knee, and medium leg. For the analysis of the tributaries, we divided them into four areas: anterior thigh (AT), posterior thigh (PT), anterior leg (AL), and posterior leg (PL). In each area, we identified the tributaries by DUS and named them as AT tributary 1, 2, and 3 (AT1, AT2, and AT3), PT tributary (PT1, PT2, and PT3) AL thigh tributary (AL1, AL2, and AL3) and PL tributary (PL1, PL2, and PL3); the point of reference was the groin for thigh and the ground for the leg ( Fig 1 ). We evaluated each tributary's diameter, patency, and presence of reflux at color Doppler examination.\n\nFor stage 2, we obtained preoperative blood tests and cardiac evaluation for those >40 years of age. In stage 3, the EVLA procedure was performed in an office outpatient setting under local tumescence anesthesia without sedation. Access to the vein was obtained at the lowest point of reflux using a percutaneous technique. A 600-nm laser fiber was used with a 1470-nm diode laser generator set at 7 Watts, continuous mode. After the procedure, the extremity was wrapped with an eccentric compression and graded compression elastic stocking with 20 to 30 mm Hg of compression at the ankle until postoperative day two. Elastic compression was maintained for 4 weeks.\n\nStage 4 consisted of a DUS examination follow-up 90 days after the procedure and application of the VCSS questionnaire. The same specialist repeated the exams that analyzed the GSV and tributaries' diameters at the same points, the patency of the treated segments, and the flow direction.\n\nResults\n\nThirty lower limbs were operated on, but two patients were lost to follow-up. We studied 28 lower limbs and 101 tributaries. The patient's ages ranged from 24 to 70 years (mean, 49), and 67.9% were female. According to CEAP classification, 21.4% of the patients were classified as C2, 39.3% as C3, 35.7% as C4, and 3.6% as C5.\n\nAll procedures were performed under local tumescent anesthesia and no sedation, with 600 nm radial fiber, using a linear endovenous energy density (LEED) from 63 to 136 j/cm, with an average LEED of 92 j/cm, considering the different diameters of GSV treated. GSV puncture was not achieved in one patient, who had a very thick vein wall, and the access was performed by dissection. The extent of GSV treated was from 13 to 79 cm (mean, 36.25 cm), considering the distal point of reflux. The GSV diameters ranged from 20.3 mm to 5.1 mm (mean, 10.1 mm) on SFJ and 16,6 mm to 3,1 mm (mean 6,85 mm) in the middle thigh.\n\nPostoperatively, all GSV segments treated were occluded. The mean diameters at SFJ decreased from 10.14 to 5.18 mm ( P < .001), from 7.1 to 3.7 mm ( P < .001) at the thigh, from 4.4 to 1.9 mm ( P < .01) at the knee level, and from 3.2 to 2.5 mm ( P = .01) on the leg ( Fig 2 ).\n\nAnalyzing the GSV tributaries by areas: in the AT, 15 tributaries were evaluated; the median diameter decreased from 4.4 mm (preoperatively) to 2.4 mm in 3 months after the surgical treatment ( P < .001) In the PT, 17 tributaries were assessed; the median diameter decreased from 4.7 to 1.7 mm ( P < .001). In the AL, 2.9 tributaries were studied; median diameters ranged from 3.8 to 2.1 mm ( P < .001). In the PL, 4.0 tributaries were assessed; the median diameter varied from 3.70 to 2.45 mm ( P < .001) ( Table I and Fig 3 ).\n\nWe identified a decrease in the number of tributaries with reflux. In the AT, the reflux was present in 81% of tributaries in preoperatively and reduced by 13.3% in 3 months after the surgical treatment ( P < .001). In the PT, it decreased from 68.7% to 12.5% ( P = .001), in the AL, it decreased from 71.4% to 25.0% ( P < .01), and in the PL, it decreased from 77.5% to 22.5% ( P < .01) ( Fig 4 ).\n\nAs observed in Table II , when we analyze the decrease in the diameters of tributaries by group, the anatomical region where there was a greater decrease in diameters was in the PT region, where we observed a reduction in the mean diameter of the tributaries by 3.4 mm; followed by the PT with a reduction of 2.52 mm, AL 2.17 mm, and PL 1.84 mm ( P = .056). All tributaries were patent preoperatively; 60% were occluded in the AT, 21.9% in the PT, 22.6% in the AL, and 12.5% in the PL ( P = .003) ( Fig 5 ).\n\nRegarding the VCSS, there was a decrease from a mean of 9 points in the preoperative period (preoperatively) to a mean of 5 points in the postoperative period (3 months after surgical treatment).\n\nDiscussion\n\nSince Min et al in 2003, numerous studies have demonstrated the safety, efficacy, and durability of EVLA in treating superficial venous reflux. 14 EVLA can be performed as an outpatient with lower morbidity and recovery time. Recurrence rates and overall quality of life are better with this treatment than with open surgery. 2\n\nAlthough EVLA is now the standard of care, there is significant variation in technique, energy delivery technology, energy dosages, and anesthetic type. Therefore, no standard protocol is adopted in all medical centers that perform this surgery. 15 , 16 , 17 , 18\n\nIn the present study, per the European Guideline of the College of Phlebology of 2019, 19 venous access to GSV was obtained at the most distal reflux point. The radial fiber with a diode laser, with a specific wavelength for water (1470 nm), can decrease postoperative pain, probably owing to less perforation of the vein wall. Therefore, the radial fiber and the Orlight Diiodo 1470 nm generator were used in all cases. 20 Regarding the energy required for thermoablation, most studies use 8 to 10 W energy, but there is no standardization of the necessary energy. In this study, a power of 7 W was used, and an average LEED of 92 j/cm was offered, which was adequate to the different diameters of the GSV; the SFJ diameters were between 6.0 and 20.3 mm (mean, 10.4 mm). 20 , 21\n\nThis study demonstrated anatomical and hemodynamic changes in the tributary veins of the GSV after EVLA, which brought a clinical improvement in patients with DVC of the lower limbs. No reports in the literature describe precise changes in the diameter of GSV tributary after EVLA. Regarding GSV occlusion, studies have consistently reported success rates of >90% in EVLA, but patient follow-up has been variable, ranging from months to several years. The present study found occlusion in all segments treated after 90 days. This higher rate than that reported in the literature can be explained by the short period of follow-up of these patients. 21 , 22\n\nAfter analyzing VCSS results in the preoperative and postoperative periods, a statistically significant decrease in the severity of symptoms of chronic venous disease was observed. These results corroborate previous studies that demonstrated the efficacy of these procedures in relieving symptoms and improving the quality of life of patients with venous disease. 23\n\nThe European multicenter cohort study on cyanoacrylate embolization of refluxing GSVs study on endovenous cyanoacrylate embolization of refluxing GSVs symptomatic with or without visible varicosities confirmed by duplex ultrasound imaging and CEAP stage of C2, C3, or C4. The proportion of patients whose target limbs were free from visible varicosities increased from 1.4% at baseline to 41.4% at 3 months of follow-up. Even more pronounced in the same period, the proportion of patients free from edema and pain increased from 41.4% and 32.9% at baseline to 90.0% and 82.1%, respectively. Similarly, quality-of-life scores showed significant improvement. 24\n\nThe effect of surgical treatment of GSV on tributary veins has been described using other surgical techniques, such as radiofrequency ablation of GSV. 25 Monahan 23 studied the outcome of tributary veins in 54 extremities whose GSV reflux was treated with radiofrequency. Six months after the procedure, they reported the complete disappearance of the tributaries in 13% of the lower limbs; varicose vein resolution was more frequent for above-knee locations. 23\n\nWelch 26 studied 181 lower limbs with varicose veins resulting from GSV reflux treated by radiofrequency. In the limbs where complete occlusion of the GSV was studied, 62.1% presented a resolution of CVD symptoms, with or without complete disappearance of the tributaries, 2 to 3 months after radiofrequency treatment, and did not require an additional surgical procedure. In the limbs that needed further treatment, 4.5% underwent sclerotherapy, and 25.2% underwent microphlebectomy. 26\n\nUsing the EVLA technique, Carradice et al 27 compared the results of 50 patients who underwent laser ablation and microphlebectomy in a prospective randomized study in one surgical stage vs two stages and reported that, although the procedure in a single stage had a longer operative time, the results after 3 months were better regarding quality of life and severity of venous disease. However, after 1 year, both groups had significant improvement for both parameters, with no statistical difference. 27 Schanzer 9 showed that many patients do not require a second intervention after a successful EVLA. In 42% of the 86 lower limbs, there was a complete disappearance of the visible tributary veins; therefore, there was no indication for second-stage surgical treatment. 9\n\nIn the present study, a decrease in the diameter of the tributaries was observed in all the groups studied, in addition to a reduction in the diameter of the tributaries with reflux. Among the 28 limbs treated, only 8 (28%) required additional treatment with foam, surgery, or sclerotherapy. A limitation of the present study was the sample size. In addition, a longer follow-up could provide crucial information on the long-term occlusion rate of GSV and the recurrence of varicose tributary veins. This research provides essential information that can support the surgical treatment of varicose veins tributaries of GSV, as it is the first to describe the morphofunctional changes that occur in these veins after EVLA.\n\nConclusions\n\nThis study demonstrated that the venous hemodynamic and anatomical parameters of the GSV tributaries improved after EVLA. There was a statistically significant decrease in the diameters of all tributary groups; the number of tributaries with reflux also decreased. However, the occlusion of tributaries was not a frequent finding.\n\nAuthor Contributions\n\nConception and design: FB, EL, EA, HG, AX, CO\n\nAnalysis and interpretation: FB, EL, AX, CO\n\nData collection: FB, AJ, CO\n\nWriting the article: FB, AJ, CO\n\nCritical revision of the article: EL, EA, HG\n\nFinal approval of the article: FB, EL, EA, HJ, AX, CO\n\nStatistical analysis: FB, AX, CO\n\nObtained funding: Not applicable\n\nOverall responsibility: FB\n\nDisclosures\n\nNone.",
