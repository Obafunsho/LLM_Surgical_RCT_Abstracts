  "title": "The Intraoperative Glycemic Response to Intravenous Insulin during Non-cardiac Surgery: A Sub-analysis of the DeLiT Randomized Trial",
  "abstract": "Patient characteristics may affect patients' response to insulin. We examined the impact of body weight, and presence of diabetes on the response to insulin during non-cardiac surgery. We studied 202 patients who were enrolled in the DeLiT Trial and received intraoperative intravenous insulin. Univariable and multivariable analyses (Bonferroni-corrected) assessed the relationship between patient's response to the initial intraoperative bolus of regular insulin and the factors of interest. Blood glucose concentrations decreased 8.3 ±10 mg dl-1 (0.46 ± 0.56 mmol litre-1) per unit of insulin in 30 minutes. The response to insulin was similar in patients with or without diabetes [adjusted mean difference (97.5% CI): 0.2 (-3.9, 4.2) mg dl-1, 0.01 (-0.22, 0.24) mmol litre-1, P = 0.93]. No relationship was found between insulin response and body weight. Our results suggest that adjustment for body weight and the presence of diabetes may not improve intraoperative insulin treatment algorithms.",
