  "title": "Risk Factors for Prolonged Length of Stay Following the Stage II Procedure in the Single Ventricle Reconstruction Trial",
  "abstract": "Objectives: The Single Ventricle Reconstruction trial randomized patients with single right ventricle lesions to a modified Blalock-Taussig or right ventricle-to-pulmonary artery shunt at the Norwood. This analysis describes outcomes at the stage II procedure and factors associated with a longer hospital length of stay (LOS).\n\nMethods: We examined the association of shunt type with stage II hospital outcomes. Cox regression and bootstrapping were used to evaluate risk factors for longer LOS. We also examined characteristics associated with in-hospital death.\n\nResults: There were 393 subjects in the analytic cohort. Median stage II procedure hospital LOS (8 days, IQR (6,14)), hospital mortality (4.3%), transplantation (0.8%), median ventilator time (2 days, IQR (1,3)), median intensive care unit LOS (4 days (IQR (3,7)), number of additional cardiac procedures or complications and serious adverse events did not differ by shunt type. Longer LOS was associated (R 2 =0.26) with center, longer post-Norwood LOS (HR 1.93 per log day, P<0.001), non-elective timing of the stage II procedure (HR 1.78, P<0.001) and pulmonary artery (PA) stenosis (HR 1.56, P<0.001). By univariate analysis, non-elective stage II (65% vs. 32%, P=0.009), ≥ moderate atrioventricular valve (AVV) regurgitation (75% vs. 24%, P<0.001) and AVV repair (53% vs. 9%, P<0.001) were among the risk factors associated with in-hospital death.\n\nConclusions: Norwood LOS, PA stenoses and non-elective stage II procedure, but not shunt type, are independently associated with longer LOS. Non-elective stage II, >moderate AVV regurgitation and need for AVV repair are among the risk factors for death.",
