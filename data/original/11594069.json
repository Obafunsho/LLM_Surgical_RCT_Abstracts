  "abstract": "Background:: Low hip bone mineral density (BMD) in patients who undergo total hip arthroplasty (THA) increases the risk of periprosthetic fractures, implant instability, and other complications. Recently, emphasis has been placed on bone health optimization: treating low BMD prior to a planned orthopaedic implant procedure in an effort to normalize BMD and reduce the potential risk of future complications. Abaloparatide is a U.S. Food and Drug Administration-approved osteoanabolic agent for men and postmenopausal women with osteoporosis and a candidate drug for bone health optimization that, in addition to benefits at the spine, increases hip BMD and reduces nonvertebral fracture risk. We hypothesized that abaloparatide would improve BMD in proximal femoral regions surrounding a virtual THA stem.\n\nMethods:: This post hoc analysis obtained dual x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) hip scans from 500 randomly selected postmenopausal women with osteoporosis from the Phase-3 Abaloparatide Comparator Trial in Vertebral Endpoints (ACTIVE, NCT01343004 ) study after 0, 6, and 18 months of abaloparatide (250 patients) or placebo (250 patients). Hip DXA scans underwent 3-dimensional (3D) modeling via 3D-Shaper, followed by virtual resection of the proximal femur and simulated placement of a tapered, flat-wedge hip stem that guided delineation of the Gruen zones that were fully (zones 1 and 7) or largely (zones 2 and 6) captured in the scanning region. Integral, cortical, and trabecular volumetric BMD, cortical thickness, and cortical surface BMD (the product of cortical volumetric BMD and cortical thickness) were determined for each zone.\n\nResults:: Compared with placebo, the abaloparatide group showed greater increases in integral volumetric BMD in all zones at months 6 and 18; cortical surface BMD in zones 1, 6, and 7 at month 6; cortical thickness, cortical volumetric BMD, and cortical surface BMD in all zones at month 18; and trabecular volumetric BMD in zones 1 and 7 at months 6 and 18.\n\nConclusions:: Abaloparatide increases BMD in proximal femoral regions that interact with and support femoral stems, suggesting that abaloparatide may have value for preoperative or potentially perioperative bone health optimization in patients with osteoporosis undergoing THA.\n\nLevel of Evidence:: Therapeutic Level III .

The current post hoc analyses are based on a subset of 500 ACTIVE trial patients (250 who were treated with abaloparatide and 250 who received placebo) who were randomly selected, with stratification by study site and race/ethnicity 15 . The hip scans underwent 3D-DXA modeling (3D-SHAPER, version 2.10.1; 3D-Shaper Medical), as described previously 27 , generating 3D patient-specific reconstructions from hip DXA scans for further analyses. The 3D-DXA uses a statistical shape and density model of a proximal femur built from a database of quantitative computed tomography images, which is registered onto the DXA scan to estimate a patient-specific 3D femoral shape and volumetric density distribution 28 . Cortical bone is segmented by fitting a function of the cortex location, cortical volumetric BMD, cortical thickness, imaging blur, and density of surrounding tissues to the density profile calculated from the normal vector at each vertex of the proximal femoral surface mesh, as previously described 29 . Cortical surface BMD is calculated as the product of cortical thickness and cortical volumetric BMD. Trabecular volumetric BMD is calculated as the mean bone density inside the endocortical surface, and integral volumetric BMD is calculated as the mean bone density of the cortical plus trabecular compartments 28 .\n\nThe ACTIVE trial was approved by the ethics committee at every participating institution and was conducted according to the recommendations of Good Clinical Practice and the Declaration of Helsinki. All patients provided written informed consent to participate 13 .\n\nVirtual Femoral Stem Implant Placement and Gruen Zone Analyses\n\nA virtual model of a flat-wedge, tapered, cementless Stryker Accolade II hip stem was optimally sized and virtually positioned within each 3D femoral reconstruction using in-house MATLAB (MathWorks) code. A size-4 implant with a high-offset 127° neck angle, 35-mm neck length, 105-mm stem length, and 42-mm offset was selected as the model template. This implant was chosen because, when positioned within the mean 3D-DXA statistical femoral model, it provided maximal contact surface between the implant and a virtual surface located 1 mm inside the endocortical surface, and the closest alignment of the implant head with the formal head center. To adapt the stem model to each patient-specific reconstruction and optimize femoral fit, rigid and nonrigid thin plate spline transformations between the mean 3D-DXA statistical femoral endocortical shape and each patient-specific endocortical shape were calculated. Those transformations were then applied to the implant shape for each patient, thus changing the implant from the starting geometry and position in order to ensure a patient-specific, optimally sized implant and a reproducible fit between patients.\n\nAfter virtual placement of the optimized implant, the proximal femoral model was virtually resected superiorly to simulate surgical resection for stem implantation (Fig. 1 -A); 1 cut passed obliquely through the base of the implant neck, and the other cut passed transversely through the upper corner of the base of the implant neck parallel with the implant shaft axis. Gruen zones were then delineated on the basis of 3 planes (Fig. 1 -B). Plane 1 passes through the center of the lesser trochanter and is perpendicular to the shaft axis, plane 2 passes through the shaft axis and is orthogonal to the cross-product of the shaft axis and the sagittal axis, and plane 3 is perpendicular to the shaft axis and is positioned 1 cm below the base of the lesser trochanter. Ultimately, Gruen zones 1 and 7 were fully captured, whereas 53% of zones 2 and 6 were captured on the basis of the maximal distance across the fields of view for all of the original DXA scans. Cortical surface BMD, cortical volumetric BMD, trabecular volumetric BMD, integral volumetric BMD, and cortical thickness were calculated for the 4 Gruen zones. To further characterize bone at the virtual implant surface, changes in volumetric BMD were calculated and visualized in a region extending 5 mm into the bone from the implant surface in all directions.\n\nStatistical Analysis\n\nComparisons of the abaloparatide and placebo groups were made using the change from baseline, with p values derived from contrast tests based on a mixed-effect, repeated-measures model that adjusted for body mass index, age, value at baseline, DXA scanner model, treatment group, visit, and treatment group-visit interaction. The 3D spatial distribution of the mean volumetric BMD changes between baseline and each follow-up time point was evaluated. All inferential tests were 2-tailed, and significance was set at p < 0.05. Statistical comparisons were performed with SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute).\n\nResults\n\nPrior to treatment, all 3D-DXA parameters in the 4 Gruen zones had similar baseline values in the abaloparatide and placebo groups (Table I). Among the 4 Gruen zones analyzed, zone 1 had the lowest baseline integral volumetric BMD and cortical thickness, followed by zone 7. Zone 1 also had the lowest baseline cortical surface BMD, followed by zone 7. Zones 1 and 7 had the highest baseline trabecular volumetric BMD, and zones 2 and 6 had the highest cortical thickness.\n\nAbaloparatide treatment significantly increased integral volumetric BMD compared with placebo in all 4 Gruen zones after 6 and 18 months (p < 0.005 for all) (Figs. 2 -A through 2 -D), with zones 1 and 7 showing the largest gains (both p < 0.0001 compared with placebo). Trabecular volumetric BMD in zones 1 and 7 increased significantly with abaloparatide compared with placebo at months 6 and 18 (p < 0.0001 for all) (Table II). The change in trabecular volumetric BMD in zones 2 and 6 could not be reliably evaluated, as most of the trabecular bone in those regions was virtually removed during implant fitting, and was thus not reported. The increase from baseline in cortical volumetric BMD was significantly greater with abaloparatide compared with placebo at month 18 in all zones (p < 0.01 for all) (Table II). Cortical thickness increased significantly from baseline with abaloparatide treatment compared with placebo in zones 1, 6, and 7 at month 6 (p < 0.01 for all), and in all zones at month 18 (p < 0.0005 for all) (Table II). Cortical surface BMD increased significantly from baseline with abaloparatide treatment compared with placebo in zones 1, 6, and 7 at month 6 (p < 0.005 for all) and in all zones at month 18 (p < 0.0001 for all) (Table II). The spatial distribution of mean changes from baseline in cortical surface BMD is illustrated in Figure 3 . The placebo group had minimal changes in cortical surface BMD at months 6 and 18, whereas the abaloparatide group showed increases in cortical surface BMD across most of the proximal femoral surface by month 6, with further increases at month 18 involving nearly the entire cortical surface.\n\nFigure 4 depicts mean volumetric BMD changes in the osseous envelope residing within 5 mm of the simulated implant surface. Minimal volumetric BMD changes were observed with placebo at month 6, but, at month 18, reduction in volumetric BMD by up to approximately 10 mg/cm 3 was seen at the medial implant surface. At month 6, the abaloparatide group showed increased volumetric BMD along most implant surfaces, generally by 5 to 10 mg/cm 3 . Further increases in volumetric BMD were observed after 18 months of abaloparatide, particularly along the medial (calcar-adjacent) surface, with volumetric BMD gains in the 10 to 20-mg/cm 3 range. Finally, a 2-dimensional visualization of changes in volumetric BMD was created in 3 planes: a frontal plane, an intertrochanteric plane, and an axial plane through the shaft of the femur (Fig. 5 ). Positive changes in volumetric BMD with abaloparatide treatment were evident at the periosteal and endosteal cortical surfaces and additionally in areas rich in trabecular bone at 6 and 18 months, in contrast to modest declines noted in the placebo group. Collectively, these colorimetric qualitative analyses support the quantitative Gruen zone analysis and provide insight into the 3D nature of the BMD changes within each zone.\n\nDiscussion\n\nThis study evaluated the effects of 6 or 18 months of systemic abaloparatide treatment compared with placebo on changes in the proximal femur of postmenopausal women with osteoporosis from the ACTIVE trial, with a focus on subregions relevant to THA. All 4 Gruen zones evaluated (1, 2, 6, and 7) showed early and progressive increases in integral volumetric BMD with abaloparatide treatment. Zones 1 and 7, which have the lowest integral volumetric BMD and cortical thickness at baseline, also showed significant increases in cortical thickness, cortical surface BMD, and trabecular volumetric BMD, and a numerical increase in cortical volumetric BMD with 6 months of abaloparatide treatment. These findings may have relevance for patients with osteoporosis who are current or future candidates for elective THA. Although the results do not reflect physical interactions between abaloparatide-related bone changes and an actual implant, they may suggest that abaloparatide has a utility for preoperative bone health optimization in candidates for THA with poor bone quality.\n\nOsteoporosis is relatively common among older individuals preparing for THA 30 , and many surgeons consider low BMD to be an important factor to include when determining operative strategy 31 . These are among the rationales behind recommendations to implement DXA screening prior to THA 7 , 8 . Cemented femoral components are often used to improve fixation in older individuals with osteoporosis 32 . However, cement increases operating time and may complicate implant retrieval if revision becomes necessary 33 , making preoperative normalization of BMD a potentially attractive strategy for prolonging the opportunity for a cementless approach. For patients with osteoporosis who are preparing for elective orthopaedic surgery, a time frame of 2 to 6 months has been suggested as a reasonable duration of preoperative osteoporosis therapy 34 . The current results show that 6 months of abaloparatide treatment significantly improved BMD in all 4 analyzed Gruen zones. Other trials in men and postmenopausal women with osteoporosis that included earlier DXA assessments showed that abaloparatide significantly increased total hip BMD within 3 months 12 , 35 . Further analysis would be fruitful to determine the relevance of early BMD changes to strength-related parameters, which may relate to prevention of implant failure.\n\nPreoperative or perioperative treatment with an osteoanabolic agent such as abaloparatide may support implant longevity through mechanisms beyond the accrual of BMD within the defined Gruen zones of this study. Abaloparatide has been shown to improve the fixation of titanium implants placed in the trabecula-rich proximal tibia of rodents 36 . Further, dynamic bone histomorphometry data from postmenopausal women with osteoporosis and from animals with low BMD have indicated that abaloparatide robustly stimulates endocortical bone formation 37 - 39 , an effect that could favor the osseointegration of endocortically placed implants. Nonhuman primate data have shown that increased endocortical bone formation with abaloparatide is accompanied by a reduced femoral endocortical perimeter 39 , an effect that may favor the primary fixation of press-fit implants and potentially reduce the risk of intraoperative fractures. Abaloparatide also increases periosteal bone formation in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis 37 , and animal studies have shown that increased periosteal bone formation with abaloparatide is associated with periosteal expansion, increased cortical thickness, and greater femoral bending strength 40 . Previous 3D-DXA analyses from the ACTIVE trial have also shown that 6 and 18 months of abaloparatide treatment have biomechanically favorable effects on structural properties of the upper femoral shaft, including the cross-sectional moment of inertia, section modulus, and buckling ratio 15 . Ultimately, additional work is needed to evaluate the full potential benefits of bone health optimization with abaloparatide. Initial insights into the effects of abaloparatide therapy on peri-implant BMD changes and complications may come from an ongoing clinical trial of men and postmenopausal women with osteoporosis who are scheduled for total knee arthroplasty, with 18 months of abaloparatide treatment starting 3 months preoperatively (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT04167163 ).\n\nThis current study had several limitations. ACTIVE trial participants were not selected for conditions that warrant THA, and such patients may show different responses to abaloparatide based on hip degenerative changes, pain-related stress-shielding, and other factors. Comparisons between medications were not possible because the current analyses did not include ACTIVE trial patients treated with open-label teriparatide, although extensive 3D-DXA data from that group can be found in other publications 15 , 16 . Furthermore, Gruen zones are based on femoral implant specifications, and different implants than the current model may yield different results. The lack of data on Gruen zones 3 to 5 in the current study was an unavoidable technical limitation due to a limited DXA field of view. However, zones 3 to 5 generally have the highest BMD in nonimplanted and recently implanted femora 18 , 19 , 24 and also exhibit less postoperative BMD loss relative to other Gruen zones 3 , 20 , 21 , 23 , 24 . Thus, the most vital zones were fully or partially captured. Finally, this study should be looked at as hypothesis-generating, and clinical confirmation of the modeled and theoretical benefits of increased BMD around an implanted stem with abaloparatide use should be sought.\n\nIn summary, the current findings provide further evidence of favorable effects of abaloparatide on the hip in patients with osteoporosis. An early and persistent increase in integral volumetric BMD and cortical thickness of the 2 virtual Gruen zones with the lowest baseline BMD, and the greatest postoperative BMD loss in patients undergoing THA, may indicate that abaloparatide treatment can result in strategically localized BMD gains that are potentially beneficial for the longevity of a future implant. Further studies are warranted to evaluate the effects of preoperative, perioperative, and postoperative abaloparatide therapy on implant-supporting bone regions in patients with osteoporosis who are undergoing THA.",
