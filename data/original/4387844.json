  "abstract": "Background: Cortical stimulation mapping (CSM) commonly uses visual naming to\ndetermine resection margins in the dominant hemisphere of epilepsy patients.\nVisual naming alone may not identify all language sites in resection-prone\nareas, prompting additional tasks for comprehensive language mapping.\n\nObjective: To demonstrate word-finding distinctions between visual, auditory,\nand reading modalities during CSM and the percentage of modality-specific\nlanguage sites within dominant hemisphere subregions.\n\nMethods: Twenty-eight epilepsy patients underwent CSM using visual, auditory,\nand sentence completion tasks. Hierarchical logistic regression analyzed\nerrors to identify language sites and provide modality-specific percentages\nwithin subregions.\n\nResults: The percentage of sites classified as language sites based on\nauditory naming was twice as high in anterior temporal regions compared to\nvisual naming, marginally higher in posterior temporal areas, and comparable\nin parietal regions. Sentence completion was comparable to visual and\nauditory naming in parietal regions, and lower in most temporal areas. Of\n470 sites tested with both visual and auditory naming, 95 sites were\ndistinctly auditory while 48 sites were distinctly visual. The remaining\nsites overlapped.\n\nConclusion: Distinct cortical areas were found for distinct input modalities,\nwith language sites in anterior tip regions found most often using auditory\nnaming. The vulnerability of anterior temporal tip regions to resection in\nthis population and distinct sites for each modality suggest a multimodality\napproach may be needed to spare crucial language sites, if sparing those\nsites can be shown to significantly reduce the rate of post-operative\nlanguage deficits without sacrificing seizure control.",
