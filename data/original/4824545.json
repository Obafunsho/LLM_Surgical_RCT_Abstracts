  "title": "A Randomized Trial Examining Preoperative Sedative Medication and Post-operative Sleep in Children",
  "abstract": "Study Objective: Midazolam has been found to have beneficial effects on anxiety in children in the pre-operative setting. Prior studies have examined various post-operative behaviors of children but little research has examined the effects of preoperative use of midazolam with post-operative sleep. The purpose of this investigation was to compare post-operative sleep in children as a function of pre-operative sedative medication use.\n\nDesign: This study was a two-group randomized controlled trial.\n\nSetting: Participants were recruited from Yale-New Haven Children’s Hospital.\n\nPatients: Participants included a convenience sample of 70 children between the ages of 3 to 12 years undergoing ambulatory tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy.\n\nInterventions: Children were randomly assigned to one of two groups: a control group who received preoperative acetaminophen only (n = 32) and an experimental group who received both acetaminophen and midazolam preoperatively (n = 38).\n\nMeasurements: Parents completed measures of post-operative behavioral recovery and a subset of children wore actigraphs to examine objective sleep data.\n\nMain Results: Children who received midazolam experienced similar sleep changes compared to children in the control group. The actigraph data revealed that children who received midazolam were awake significantly less during the night compared to the control group ( p = 0.01).\n\nConclusion: Children who received midazolam before surgery had similar post-operative sleep changes compared to children who did not receive midazolam. Further understanding of the post-operative behavioral effects of midazolam on children will help guide healthcare providers in their practice.",
