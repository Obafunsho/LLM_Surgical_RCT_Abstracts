Introduction\n\nMore than 200,000 patients undergo cardiac surgery annually in China [ 1 ]. \nCardiac surgery patients are among the highest consumers of allogeneic blood \ntransfusions in hospitals. According to data from the Chinese Cardiac Surgery \nRegistry, perioperative allogeneic blood transfusion rates in isolated coronary \nartery bypass grafting and isolated mitral valve surgery in 2022 were 42.3% and \n55.5%, respectively [ 1 ]. Allogeneic blood transfusion increases the risks of \nblood-borne transmitted infections and transfusion-related adverse reactions. \nGrowing evidence has shown that allogeneic transfusion is associated with \nincreased mortality and morbidity in cardiac surgery patients.\n\nCardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) is the leading cause of increased perioperative \nblood transfusion in cardiac surgery. Full anticoagulation is required for CPB. \nIn addition, CPB induces hemodilution due to the priming volume of the circuit, \nactivates blood components through contact with artificial surfaces, and causes \nblood cells mechanical damage via blood pumps. These result in a decreased level \nof hemoglobin (Hb), consumption of coagulation factors and platelets, and \nhyperfibrinolysis, thus increasing the risks of perioperative anemia, massive \nblood loss, and allogeneic transfusion [ 2 ].\n\nPatient blood management (PBM) is a patient-centered, systematic, evidence-based \napproach to improving patient outcomes by managing and preserving the blood of \npatients while promoting patient safety and empowerment. Thus, implementing a \ncomprehensive perioperative PBM program in cardiac surgery could reduce \nhemodilution, blood component activation, and blood cell damage, decrease \npostoperative anemia, infection risks, and cardiovascular complications, and \nultimately improve the outcomes of patients.\n\nThe perioperative PBM program comprises interventions against the CPB-related \npathophysiologic process. The China National Center for Cardiovascular Quality \nImprovement has included implementing the perioperative transfusion rate and the \nPBM program within quality metrics. For years, the Chinese Society of \nCardiothoracic and Vascular Anesthesiology and other academic societies have \npromoted the perioperative PBM program in cardiac surgery patients.\n\nMeanwhile, societies in the United States and Europe have endorsed PBM \nguidelines for cardiac surgery [ 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 ]. In 2018, the Chinese Society of \nCardiothoracic and Vascular Anesthesiology released the Expert Consensus on PBM \nin cardiac surgery [ 8 ]. Subsequently, following the increasing number of centers \nin China implementing comprehensive PBM programs in cardiac surgery [ 9 , 10 ] and \ngrowing evidence with high quality [ 11 , 12 , 13 ] published in recent years, the \nstrategies and interventions have been updated; for example, the latest \nguidelines from the Association for the Advancement of Blood and Biotherapies \n(AABB) recommended a threshold for red blood cell transfusion of 7.5 g/dL [ 14 ].\n\nIn China, certified perfusionists have different specialties and diverse \nbackgrounds; therefore, the understanding and implementation of PBM can vary \ngreatly. According to a 2021 survey of 181 cardiac centers in China [ 15 ], \nlarge-volume centers (performing ≥ 2000 cardiac surgeries annually) \ndemonstrated significantly lower intraoperative packed red blood cells (pRBC) \ntransfusion rates compared to small-volume centers (performing < 2000 \ncases/year) (45% (23.59%, 55.00%) vs. 70% (30%, 90%), p = 0.008). \nFurthermore, large-volume centers were likelier to adopt strictive transfusion \nstrategies and implement a broader range of PBM interventions. To promote \nperioperative PBM program in adult cardiac surgery, reduce blood loss and \nallogeneic transfusion, and improve patient outcomes, the Working Group on \nCardiopulmonary Bypass and Extracorporeal Life Support of China National Center \nfor Cardiovascular Quality Improvement presents evidence-based guidelines on PBM \nfor adult cardiac surgery under CPB. These guidelines provide recommendations for \nall clinicians working in the field of PBM in cardiac surgery, emphasizing the \nPBM related to CPB.\n\n2. Methods\n\nThe Working Group on Cardiopulmonary Bypass and Extracorporeal Life Support of \nChina National Center for Cardiovascular Quality Improvement commissioned and \napproved this work. Bingyang Ji, Lei Du, and Chengbin Zhou were selected as \nchairpersons to assemble and coordinate the Guidelines Panel of multidisciplinary \nexperts, including perfusionists, anesthesiologists, cardiac surgeons, \nintensivists, and transfusion medicine specialists (Supplementary \nMaterial A) . The guidelines were prepared according to the World Health Organization (WHO) Handbook for \nGuideline Development (second edition) [ 16 ] and the Basic Methods and Procedures \nfor Formulating/Revising Clinical Practice Guidelines issued by the Chinese \nMedical Association [ 17 ]. Based on the prior investigation, the Guidelines Panel \ndeveloped thirteen key clinical questions from four aspects according to the \npopulation, intervention, comparison, and outcome (PICO) format. These four \naspects consist of priming and fluid management and anticoagulation and \nmonitoring during CPB, alongside peri-CPB blood product infusion and autologous \nblood infusion. A systemic review was conducted for each question using MEDLINE, \nEmbase, China Biology Medicine disc, Wanfang Database, and China National \nKnowledge Infrastructure (see keywords for each question in the Supplementary Material B ). The literature search included systematic \nreviews, meta-analyses, and interventional and observational studies published \nfrom January 2000. The literature search was conducted in December 2023, and a \npragmatic update was conducted in August 2024. All the relevant articles in \nEnglish or Chinese were included for systemic review. Nineteen recommendations \nwere generated for the questions. According to the Grading of Recommendations \nAssessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach [ 18 ], the \nquality of evidence was initially determined by study design, with randomized \ncontrolled trials (RCTs) starting as high-quality and observational studies as \nlow-quality. This initial rating was then adjusted based on five factors that \nmay downgrade evidence (risk of bias, inconsistency, indirectness, imprecision, \nand publication bias) and three factors that may upgrade evidence (large effect \nsize, dose-response gradient, and plausible confounding). The final quality of \nevidence was categorized as high, moderate, low, or very low (Table 1 ). \nRecommendations were graded as “strong” or “conditional” after considering \nthe quality of the evidence, risk-benefit balance, the assumptions about the \nrelative importance of outcomes, cost-effectiveness, acceptability, feasibility, \nand the context of national policy in China. Strong recommendations were those \nfor which the panel was highly confident that the recommended option favorably \nbalanced the expected benefits and risks for most patients in clinical practice. \nConditional recommendations were those for which the panel was less confident \nthat the potential benefits outweighed the risks.\n\nAn agreement was reached through conference calls and face-to-face meetings. All \nthe Guideline Panel members reviewed the proposed recommendations. Members \nwithout a relevant conflict of interest voted on each recommendation to achieve \nconsensus using a modified Delphi technique. Members were encouraged to provide \nopen-ended feedback on each statement. Each guidance statement required a 75% \nvoting participation rate and at least 80% consensus for approval and inclusion \nin the guidelines. Recommendations that did not meet these thresholds were \nrevised based on the feedback received and redistributed for further voting. All \nrecommendations reached a consensus after four rounds of revisions and voting.\n\n3. Priming and Fluid Management During CPB\n\nQuestion 1. Should the priming volume be reduced to decrease the \nperioperative allogeneic transfusions?\n\nRecommendation 1. A CPB circuit with reduced priming volume is \nrecommended as an effective measure of patient blood management (strong \nrecommendation, high certainty) .\n\nRecommendation 2. Retrograde autologous priming (RAP) is suggested to \nreduce perioperative allogeneic blood transfusion in adult cardiac surgery \n(strong recommendation, moderate certainty) .\n\nThe total priming volume of the CPB circuit determines the degree of \nhemodilution. The ratio of priming volume to the estimated patient blood volume \nor body surface area is positively correlated with the risk of allogeneic \ntransfusion [ 19 , 20 , 21 ].\n\nMultiple measures were used to modify the circuit to reduce the priming volume, \nincluding shortening the circuit’s length, vacuum-assisted venous drainage, using \noxygenators with integrated arterial filters, and closed circuits [ 9 , 10 , 21 , 22 , 23 , 24 , 25 , 26 ]. \nFor example, the modified low-priming CPB circuit (FUWAI-SAVE) used in several \ncenters in China reduces the priming volume by approximately 40% compared to \ntraditional extracorporeal circulation systems [ 9 , 22 , 23 ]. Based on the published \nliterature, circuits with reduced priming volume could significantly reduce \nperioperative bleeding, decrease blood transfusion, and improve patient outcomes \n[ 9 , 10 , 22 , 23 , 24 ]. Moreover, RAP represents another noteworthy technique for reducing \npriming volume. RAP refers to introducing the patient’s blood into the CPB \ncircuit after cannulation and before the bypass is initiated to displace the \nprime solutions. An RCT in China demonstrated RAP benefits patients with small \nbody surface area [ 27 ]. A meta-analysis including 12 small RCTs and 17 \nobservational studies showed that RAP can significantly reduce perioperative \nblood product transfusions [ 28 ]. When applying RAP technology, blood is drained \nfrom the body into the circuit after arterial cannulation and before initiating \nbypass, which can lead to hypovolemia and a subsequent drop in blood pressure. \nTherefore, RAP should be avoided or used with caution in patients with \nhemodynamic instability or those at high risk of hypovolemia, and close attention \nmust be paid to maintaining the patient’s circulatory stability to ensure \nsurgical safety.\n\nQuestion 2. Which solutions should be selected as the optimal \npriming solution?\n\nRecommendation 3. Balanced crystalloid solutions are recommended as the \npriming solution (strong recommendation, high certainty) .\n\nRecommendation 4. In patients with preoperative hypoalbuminemia, adding \nhuman serum albumin into the priming solution may be considered (conditional \nrecommendation, low certainty) .\n\nRecommendation 5. Hydroxyethyl starch solution is not recommended for \npriming (strong recommendation, high certainty). However, a gelatin solution may \nbe considered (conditional recommendation, very low certainty) .\n\nCrystalloids and colloid solutions are the priming fluid choices for CPB. \nCrystalloids comprise 0.9% saline and balanced crystal solutions, while colloids \ninclude human albumin and synthetic solutions (such as hydroxyethyl starch and \ngelatin). Different centers have significantly different preferences for priming \nsolutions [ 29 ].\n\n0.9% saline may be associated with an increased need for blood transfusion \ncompared to balanced crystalloid solutions in non-cardiovascular surgery patients \n[ 30 ]. A Cochrane review that included 18 RCTs found that perioperative use of \nnormal saline might increase the risk of hyperchloremic acidosis compared to \nbalanced crystal solutions [ 31 ]. Based on the above research, the balanced \ncrystalloid solution is recommended for priming.\n\nNumerous studies have compared the impact of different priming strategies of the \ncrystalloid solution, human albumin, and artificial colloid on perioperative \nblood transfusion and postoperative bleeding. However, no unified conclusion has \nbeen reached. Meta-analyses with different inclusion criteria, publication times, \ncomparison methods, and study endpoints also yielded inconsistent findings \n[ 32 , 33 , 34 , 35 , 36 , 37 ].\n\nAlthough clinical research in the field of critical care suggested that human \nalbumin is associated with favorable outcomes [ 38 , 39 ], and the evidence showed \nthat albumin might have the potential role in protecting the endothelial \nglycocalyx of the endothelium [ 40 ], its effect in cardiac surgery under CPB \nremains unclear. A recent single-center, randomized, double-blind, controlled \ntrial [ 41 , 42 ] that included 1407 adult patients undergoing cardiac surgery under \nCPB compared the effects of 4% albumin solution and acetate Ringer’s solution \nused in the priming solution and perioperative fluid therapy on major \npostoperative complications. The study found that the albumin group had higher \nrates of bleeding events and perioperative blood product transfusions than the \nRinger’s solution group, with no difference in the incidence of perioperative \nadverse events between the two groups. Influenced by this study, a recent network \nmeta-analysis [ 34 ] showed that the albumin priming strategy might increase the \nrisk of red blood cell transfusion compared with the crystalloid priming \nstrategy. Another meta-analysis [ 35 ] showed that albumin infusion during cardiac \nsurgery did not reduce perioperative mortality. Based on the above studies and \nthe significantly higher cost of human albumin compared to other solutions, it is \nnot recommended to use albumin in CPB priming solutions routinely. However, for \npatients with preoperative hypoalbuminemia, the use of albumin in priming may be \nbeneficial owing to evidence that perioperative hypoalbuminemia is independently \nassociated with poor prognosis in cardiac surgery patients [ 43 , 44 ].\n\nA hydroxyethyl starch-based solution is a nonionic starch derivative, which has \nbeen proven to be associated with the risk of perioperative bleeding, coagulation \nimpairment, increased blood product transfusion, and renal injury by several \nstudies and meta-analyses [ 45 , 46 , 47 , 48 , 49 ]. Based on the above risks, the China National \nMedical Products Administration issued an announcement in 2022 regarding \nrevisions of the instructions for hydroxyethyl starch injections [ 50 ], which \nrecommended against the use of hydroxyethyl starch in cardiac surgery with CPB. \nThe United States and Europe have also issued warning statements for the clinical \nuse of hydroxyethyl starch [ 51 ].\n\nGelatin solutions are colloid solutions of animal origin. After the warning \nagainst hydroxyethyl starch solutions, gelatin is currently the most commonly \nused synthetic colloid for priming fluids in China. However, the limited studies \nconducted on gelatin presented small sample sizes and low-quality data. These \nstudies did not show an increased risk of bleeding, kidney injury, or prolonged \nintensive care unit (ICU) time [ 52 ]. Thus, it is important to be cautious when \nusing gelatin solutions, as they can easily cause allergic reactions [ 53 ], mostly \nmanifesting as a decrease in blood pressure.\n\nIn summary, the weight of colloids in CPB fluid therapy has shifted downward due \nto an understanding of the structure of endothelioglycalyx, the revised \nStarling’s Principle, and the reduction in priming volume. Recent studies have \nfound that albumin increases the risk of blood transfusion, driving us to rethink \nwhether colloid is needed in the priming solutions [ 34 ].\n\nQuestion 3. Should ultrafiltration be used during CPB to reduce \nallogeneic transfusion?\n\nRecommendation 6. For patients with large priming volumes, large blood \nvolumes, or anticipated large residual pump blood volumes, ultrafiltration should \nbe considered part of PBM (strong recommendation, moderate certainty) .\n\nUltrafiltration consists of conventional ultrafiltration (CUF), zero-balance \nultrafiltration, and modified ultrafiltration (MUF). A meta-analysis [ 54 ] that \nincluded 10 RCTs and 1004 patients showed that ultrafiltration could reduce \nperioperative blood transfusion and postoperative bleeding in adult cardiac \nsurgery. However, the study did not analyze patients according to different forms \nof ultrafiltration. Another meta-analysis in 2024 [ 55 ] examined CUF (two \nobservational studies, n = 47,007) and MUF (seven RCTs, n = 928; the sample size \nof the largest study was n = 573 [ 56 ]) separately and showed that modified \nultrafiltration reduced intraoperative RBC transfusion, whereas conventional \nultrafiltration did not. The two observational studies included in this \nmeta-analysis were multicenter retrospective studies [ 57 , 58 ]. Differences in \ntransfusion thresholds among multiple centers might affect the evaluation of the \nblood-conservation effect of CUF. MUF was previously widely used in small-weight \nchildren; however, the technique has recently been gradually expanded to adult \npatients. Another meta-analysis [ 59 ] also demonstrated that modified \nultrafiltration in adult cardiac surgery could increase postoperative hemoglobin \nlevels, decrease postoperative drainage, and reduce blood transfusions. However, \nthe above studies were published early, and the priming volumes were relatively \nlarge (1500–2000 mL). Hence, the value of ultrafiltration as a PBM measure in \nlow-priming CPB requires further study. For patients with large priming volumes, \nlarge blood volumes, or those expected to have large volumes of residual pump \nblood, ultrafiltration should be considered a PBM measure. In addition, it should \nbe noted that several studies [ 57 , 60 , 61 ] have shown that excessive \nultrafiltration volume during CPB might increase the risk of postoperative acute \nkidney injury (AKI). A multicenter registry [ 57 ] study further highlighted that a \npatient’s preoperative renal function influences the risk of AKI. Specifically, \namong patients with a creatinine clearance of less than 99.6 mL/min, a higher \nvolume of CUF was associated with an elevated risk of AKI. Therefore, in patients \nwith preoperative renal dysfunction, the volume of CUF should be carefully \ncontrolled to avoid excessive use. The Guideline Panel recommends the reduced \npriming volume strategy to lower perioperative fluids infusion rather than \nexcessive ultrafiltration.\n\nIt is worth noting that fluid management, including priming volume, fluid \nselection, ultrafiltration application, or fluid balance management, should be \nindividualized for each patient. This represents an important direction for \nfuture research.\n\n4. Anticoagulation and Monitoring During CPB\n\nQuestion 4. How should heparization and protamine neutralization be \nmanaged appropriately?\n\nRecommendation 7. Fresh frozen plasma or antithrombin Ⅲ (ATⅢ) \nconcentrate could be considered in patients with heparin resistance who could not \nachieve an activated clotting time (ACT) target of 480 seconds after the \nadministration of unfractionated heparin 600 U/kg (conditional recommendation, \nmoderate certainty) .\n\nRecommendation 8. Continuous monitoring of heparin residual and rebound \nmay be considered from the initial protamine neutralization to 6 h after surgery \n(conditional recommendation, moderate certainty) .\n\nUnfractionated heparin (UFH) is the standard anticoagulant for CPB. UFH produces \nits major anticoagulant effect by binding its pentose sequence to ATⅢ and \nenhancing the inhibition of ATⅢ on coagulation factors [ 62 ]. Heparin resistance \nrefers to the inability to achieve the targeted anticoagulation levels with \nsufficient UFH doses. Currently, there is no universal definition of heparin \nresistance for CPB. In 2024, a review by the Scientific Standards Committee of \nthe International Society for Thrombosis and Hemostasis [ 63 ] proposed a \nstandardized definition for heparin resistance as the inability to obtain an ACT \ntarget for CPB of 480 seconds or more after 500 U/kg. The primary approach to \nmanaging heparin resistance remains increasing the heparin dose; however, the \nmaximum dose of UFH administered before initiating ATⅢ supplementary therapy to \nachieve a target ACT varied among different centers. According to a 2019 survey, \nthe majority of the respondents selected 600 U/kg as the preferred threshold \n[ 64 ]. ATⅢ could be supplemented by infusing fresh frozen plasma or administering \nATⅢ concentrates [ 65 , 66 , 67 ]. Each milliliter of fresh frozen plasma contains 1 International Unit (IU) \nATⅢ, meaning 5–15 mL/kg of fresh frozen plasma could be adequate to correct \nheparin resistance; the suggested dose of ATⅢ concentrates is 500–1000 IU. \nDespite the lack of published clinical trials directly comparing fresh frozen \nplasma and AT concentrates, some literature generally favored ATⅢ as a safe, \nefficient, and effective choice for the clinical management of heparin \nresistance; its benefits include lower volume administration, less risk of \ntransfusion-related acute lung injury and lower risk of transfusion-related \ninfections, as well as avoiding volume overload and intraoperative time delay. \nHowever, antithrombin concentrate may pose a risk of heparin rebound in patients \nin the early postoperative period [ 65 , 66 ], and the price of ATⅢ concentrates \naffects the commercial application in China. The Guideline Panel suggested that \nwhen the ACT value could not reach 480 s after administering 600 U/kg UFH before \nCPB, the fresh frozen plasma or ATⅢ concentrates could be considered.\n\nAfter weaning from CPB, protamine is administered to neutralize the effect of \nUFH. Protamine binds its cationic arginine group to anionic heparin in a 1:1 \nratio through electrostatic binding, forming a salt complex cleared by the \nreticuloendothelial system [ 68 ]. Inadequate protamine could leave residual-free \nheparin in the blood, but excess protamine could impair coagulation function. The \nimpact of protamine overdose on coagulation may be attributed to several \nmechanisms, including effects on platelet function, inhibition of the \nGlycoprotein Ib-von Willebrand Factor interaction, reduced thrombin generation, \nand impaired activation of clotting factors such as factor V, factor VII, and \nfactor VIII. Meanwhile, the optimal strategy for protamine dosing is \ncontroversial due to the difficulty in estimating heparin concentrations in vivo ; the conventional method is to administer protamine at a ratio \nof about 1:1 according to the initial or total heparin dose. However, a study \n[ 69 ] found that an initial heparin dose-based 1:1 protamine dosing strategy might \nlead to protamine overdosing by inhibiting the coagulation process. In \ncomparison, an individualized protamine dosing strategy is more appropriate. \nCurrently, several titration methods have been proposed, including the hemostatic \nmanagement system (HMS) titration strategy [ 70 , 71 , 72 ], ACT-based model dosing \nstrategy [ 73 ], statistical model dosing strategy [ 74 ], and pharmacokinetic model \ndosing strategy [ 75 ]. However, these titration methods are only supported by \nsmall studies involving patients with a low risk of bleeding [ 76 ]. Thus, more \nresearch is needed to find a more accurate and cost-effective method for \nmeasuring heparin concentration or develop a better model to calculate heparin \nconcentrations in patients with a high risk of bleeding [ 77 ].\n\nHeparin rebound occurs when detectable heparin blood levels are present remotely \nafter adequate heparin reversal with protamine. One study suggested that 10% to \n15% of patients receiving usual heparin doses for CPB would have detectable \nheparin levels 2 hours after protamine reversal [ 78 ]. A small prospective study \n[ 79 ] measured plasma heparin concentrations at 1 hour, 2 hours, 4 hours, 6 hours, \nand 24 hours following the end of the protamine infusion and found residual \nheparin appeared in all patients 2 hours later, with the peak heparin \nconcentration occurring at the 4-hour time-point. A randomized trial involving \n300 patients showed that a continuous protamine infusion after initial protamine \nreversal (25 mg/h for 6 hours) could abolish heparin rebound and result in modest \nbut significant reductions in chest tube drainage but not transfusion \nrequirements [ 80 ]. Based on the above evidence, the Guideline Panel suggested \ncontinuous monitoring of heparin rebound within 6 hours postoperatively either by \nHMS, ACT, or viscoelastic testing to guide protamine redosing. Specifically, we \nsuggested monitoring for heparin rebound at 2-hour, 4-hour, and 6-hour following \ncardiac surgery.\n\nUFH is contraindicated for patients with acute or subacute heparin-induced \nthrombocytopenia who are awaiting emergency cardiac surgery under CPB, and \nbivalirudin is the first-line alternative. In cases where HIT is complicated by \nsevere renal insufficiency, argatroban is preferred due to its non-renal \nclearance pathway [ 81 ].\n\nQuestion 5. How should anticoagulation be appropriately monitored \nduring CPB?\n\nRecommendation 9. Maintaining ACT above 480 seconds (celite method) \nduring CPB is recommended (strong recommendation, moderate certainty). It is \nreasonable to determine the appropriate target ACT values of different \ninstruments for CPB based on the instructions (conditional recommendation, low \ncertainty) .\n\nRecommendation 10. The ACT value should be monitored regularly during \nCPB (every 30–60 minutes) to guide heparin redosing (strong recommendation, low \ncertainty) .\n\nACT is the gold standard for anticoagulation monitoring in CPB. The \nestablishment of the ACT threshold for CPB is based on the earlier observations \nof clot or fibrin formation in the circuits of CPB. An ACT above 480 seconds was \nbelieved to be a threshold with reasonable safety and is still in use. Although \nthe evidence is insufficient, the threshold of 480 seconds has been written into \nthe CPB standards, guidelines, and textbooks [ 68 , 82 ]. The half-life of 400 U/kg \nheparin is 152 ± 5 min [ 83 ]. Therefore, monitoring the ACT value regularly \nevery 30 to 60 minutes during CPB to guide heparin redosing is reasonable. \nMoreover, shortening the ACT monitoring interval for patients with preoperative \nlow plasma ATⅢ levels, resistance to heparin, and a large amount of \nultrafiltration during CPB or large urine volume is likewise reasonable.\n\nPresently, multiple commercial instruments can automatically detect the ACT \nvalues. Celite was the activator of early ACT instruments, while current ACT \nmonitoring equipment may also use activators such as kaolin and phospholipids. \nThus, the ACT values detected by these devices are slightly different due to the \ndifference in activators [ 84 , 85 ]. ACT equipment using a celite activator tends to \nprovide higher values at lower ACT ranges while returning lower values at the \nhigher ACT range when compared to the kaolin activator [ 84 ]. Even with different \nACT devices using the same activator, ACT measurement values may still deviate \n[ 86 ]. Hence, it is reasonable to determine the appropriate ACT thresholds for CPB \nfor different ACT devices based on ACT bias values with the traditional \ncelite-based instrument.\n\nQuestion 6. Should viscoelastic testing be performed to guide \nhemostasis management and reduce bleeding?\n\nRecommendation 11. For patients with coagulopathy, thromboelastogram \n(TEG)/rotational thromboelastometry (ROTEM) is recommended to guide hemostasis \nmanagement and blood product transfusion after weaning off CPB (strong \nrecommendation, high certainty) .\n\nViscoelastic point-of-care (POC) whole blood tests, including TEG and rotational \nROTEM, are commonly used for diagnosing perioperative coagulation function in \ncardiac surgery [ 87 , 88 ]. TEG and ROTEM have similar parameters [ 89 ], reflecting \nthe entire process from blood coagulation to fibrinolysis. Multiple studies \n[ 90 , 91 , 92 , 93 , 94 , 95 ] have shown that TEG/ROTEM monitoring during on-pump cardiac surgery could \nnot only reduce blood product infusion and bleeding but might also lower the \nrisks of postoperative AKI [ 94 ] and mortality [ 95 ]. The multicenter RCT with the \nlargest sample size (n = 7402) showed that the TEG/ROTEM-based transfusion \nalgorithm started from CPB rewarming could reduce allogeneic transfusions and \nmajor bleeding following cardiac surgery [ 91 ]. TEG/ROTEM has been recommended for \nperioperative hemostasis management by multiple guidelines and expert consensus \n[ 6 , 96 , 97 ]. Some centers have developed institutional TEG/ ROTEM-based \ntransfusion algorithms during and after CPB [ 90 , 91 , 95 ] (See examples for \nTEG/ROTEM-based hemostatic interventions and transfusion algorithms in Supplementary Material C ). However, the optimal monitoring timing and \napproach still need further study.\n\nQuestion 7. Should antifibrinolytic therapy be used to reduce \nbleeding and transfusion?\n\nRecommendation 12. The prophylactic administration of tranexamic acid is \nrecommended to reduce bleeding and blood product transfusion (strong \nrecommendation, high certainty) .\n\nSurgical procedures and CPB cause hyperfibrinolysis, leading to perioperative \nbleeding. Tranexamic acid is a synthetic lysine analog that inhibits fibrinolysis \nby competitively inhibiting plasmin and plasminogen and is regarded as a mainstay \nantifibrinolytic agent in cardiac surgery due to its safety and high \nantifibrinolytic efficacy [ 98 ]. Previous studies [ 99 , 100 , 101 ] have shown that \ntranexamic acid reduced bleeding and blood transfusion without increasing \npostoperative deep vein thrombotic complications or death. However, the dosage of \ntranexamic acid has been debated, and the effects of different doses of \ntranexamic acid on patient outcomes have been studied [ 13 , 102 , 103 , 104 ]. Although \nhigh doses of tranexamic acid are more likely to reduce blood loss and infection, \na high dosage might increase the risk of seizure [ 103 ]. In 2022, a multicenter \nRCT (optimal study) [ 13 ] involving 3079 Chinese adult patients undergoing cardiac \nsurgery with CPB showed that a high dosage (a 30 mg/kg bolus, a 16 mg/kg/h \nmaintenance dose, and a 2 mg/kg prime) compared with a low dose (a 10 mg/kg \nbolus, a 2 mg/kg/h maintenance dose, and a 1 mg/kg prime) of tranexamic acid \ninfusion resulted in a modest statistically significant reduction in the \nproportion of patients who received allogeneic red blood cell transfusion and met \ncriteria for noninferiority concerning a composite primary safety endpoint.\n\nEpsilon aminocaproic acid is also a lysine analog. Several studies [ 105 , 106 , 107 ] \ncompared the effectiveness of epsilon aminocaproic acid to tranexamic acid in \nreducing blood loss and transfusion requirements in patients undergoing cardiac \nsurgery. These studies found no significant difference between the two drugs. \nHowever, there is limited evidence on epsilon aminocaproic acid, and further \nlarge-scale studies are needed to demonstrate its efficacy and safety.\n\n5. Peri-CPB Blood Product Infusion\n\nQuestion 8. Should a restrictive transfusion strategy be applied in \ncardiac surgery?\n\nRecommendation 13 . A restrictive transfusion strategy is \nrecommended (strong recommendation, high certainty). Generally, it is suggested \nthat Hb levels ≥ 7 g/dL should be maintained during CPB and that Hb ≥ 8 g/dL should be maintained after CPB (strong recommendation, moderate \ncertainty). An individualized Hb target strategy based on oxygen \ndelivery–consumption balance may be considered (conditional recommendation, \nmoderate certainty) .\n\nDuring CPB, patients’ Hb levels tend to decrease due to hemodilution, hemolysis, \nand blood loss. Evidence from recent RCTs, systematic reviews, and meta-analyses \nsupports that a restrictive transfusion strategy during the perioperative period \nof cardiac surgery can reduce perioperative red blood cell transfusion \nrequirements without increasing the risk of mortality or major adverse clinical \nevents. The TRICS III study [ 11 , 12 ], a multicenter RCT that included \n5243 adult patients undergoing on-pump cardiac surgery with a EuroSCORE of ≥ 6, found that a restrictive transfusion strategy (transfusing red blood \ncells only when Hb < 7.5 g/dL) significantly reduced transfusion rates compared \nto a liberal strategy (transfusing when Hb < 9.5 g/dL in the operating room or \nICU, or Hb < 8.5 g/dL on the ward) without increasing the risk of adverse \noutcomes at discharge or six months follow-up. Based on the TRICS III study, the \n2023 AABB red blood cell transfusion guidelines [ 14 ] and the 2019 guidelines from \nthe Society of Cardiovascular Anesthesiologists [ 108 ] recommend a perioperative \ntransfusion threshold of 7.5 g/dL in cardiac surgery.\n\nHypothermia and anesthesia during CPB reduce oxygen consumption, meaning the \ntransfusion threshold during CPB could be slightly lower than 7.5 g/dL. A large \nretrospective study in China [ 9 ] demonstrated that maintaining a target Hb level \nof ≥ 7 g/dL during CPB is safe. However, the optimal postoperative Hb \nthreshold remains debated. A dual-center retrospective study also in China that \nincluded 8206 patients [ 109 ] reported a significant increase in in-hospital \nmortality risk when the postoperative Hb fell below 7 g/dL. The commonly adopted \npostoperative transfusion threshold of 8 g/dL in major Chinese centers [ 8 , 9 ] has \nshown favorable patient outcomes. Therefore, based on the above evidence, this \nguideline recommends maintaining a target Hb level of ≥ 8 g/dL post-CPB.\n\nMoreover, a fixed Hb threshold may not be suitable for all cases; patient \nfactors such as gender, age, comorbidities (e.g., older patients, heart failure, \nhypoxemic), temperature, oxygen delivery–consumption balance, cardiac and \npulmonary functions, and CPB flow should also be considered. The Hb \nthreshold for transfusion should be individualized. Furthermore, strictly \nadhering to a restrictive transfusion strategy without considering the patient’s \nclinical condition may increase the risk of tissue ischemia, inadequate oxygen \ndelivery, postoperative delirium, and other adverse events. There is a growing \nconsensus that the risks and benefits of restrictive versus liberal transfusion \nstrategies may vary from person to person. Intraoperative monitoring tools that \nreflect oxygen delivery–consumption balance, such as blood lactate \nconcentration, cerebral tissue oxygenation, and venous oxygen saturation, can \nhelp inform individualized decisions. For instance, a retrospective study [ 110 ] \nindicated that red blood cell transfusions during CPB are beneficial when venous \noxygen saturation (SvO 2 ) drops below 68% and/or the oxygen extraction ratio \nexceeds 39%. Additionally, multiple guidelines [ 111 ] recommend goal-directed \nperfusion based on oxygen delivery (DO 2 ), suggesting that Hb targets should \nbe individualized according to DO 2 and achievable CPB flow or cardiac \noutput.\n\nIt is important to emphasize that preoperative anemia management is critical in \nreducing intraoperative transfusion requirements and ensuring adequate Hb levels \nand oxygen supply during surgery. For patients with preoperative anemia, \nintravenous ferric carboxymaltose (1000–1500 mg) within 4 weeks in patients with \npreoperative iron deficiency or non-anemic iron deficiency may reduce RBC \ntransfusion, or erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (40,000 IU weekly combination \nintravenous iron) in patients with refractory anemia may reduce transfusion rates \n[ 112 , 113 , 114 ].\n\nQuestion 9. How should other blood products be used appropriately?\n\nRecommendation 14. Prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC) may be used for \npatients with severe bleeding after CPB due to the confirmed deficiency of \nclotting factors (conditional recommendation, low certainty) .\n\nRecommendation 15. For patients with severe bleeding and low fibrinogen \nlevels after CPB, fibrinogen supplementation may be considered as it is not \ninferior to cryoprecipitate in efficacy (strong recommendation, moderate \ncertainty) .\n\nPCC contains concentrated vitamin K-dependent factors (II, VII, IX, X). Fresh \nfrozen plasma (FFP) is reserved for multifactorial coagulopathy (e.g., combined \nfactor deficiencies without a dominant deficit). Routine transfusion of FFP and \nPCC is not generally recommended in cardiac surgery under CPB unless there is \nsignificant post-CPB bleeding or a confirmed deficiency of clotting factors. \nRetrospective studies on the relationship between post-CPB FFP transfusion and \npatient outcomes have yielded conflicting results [ 115 , 116 ]. One study [ 115 ] (n \n= 12,043) found that FFP transfusion did not increase the risk of in-hospital \nmortality, infection, or acute kidney injury. In contrast, another study [ 116 ] (n \n= 119,138) reported an association between FFP transfusion and an elevated 30-day \npostoperative mortality risk. The PROPHESY study [ 117 ] (n = 50) observed no \nstatistically significant difference in clotting factor levels after FFP or PCC \ninfusion in patients with post-CPB bleeding. However, a meta-analysis [ 118 ] that \nincluded eight studies involving 1500 cardiovascular surgery patients found that \nPCC transfusion significantly reduced chest tube drainage and transfusion \nrequirements within 24 hours postoperatively. A meta-analysis estimated that PCC \ncould indirectly reduce hospitalization costs through approximately 10% decrease \nin the RBC transfusion [ 119 ]. Therefore, in cases of \nsevere bleeding and clotting factor deficiency post-CPB, PCC transfusion may be \nconsidered.\n\nBoth cryoprecipitate and human fibrinogen concentrate can treat fibrinogen \ndeficiency following CPB. In addition to fibrinogen, cryoprecipitate provides \nVIII, XIII, and von Willebrand factors. A cryoprecipitate dose of 1 unit per 10 \nkg body weight (approximately 15 mL) can increase plasma fibrinogen levels by 0.5 \ng/L [ 120 ]. Currently, only one small prospective study [ 121 ] (n = 13) has \nevaluated the use of cryoprecipitate in CPB cardiovascular surgery, finding that \ncryoprecipitate administration improved fibrinogen levels and fibrin-based clot \nstrength in patients undergoing deep hypothermic circulatory arrest during aortic \nsurgery. Another RCT [ 122 ] (n = 48) found that preoperative supplementation with \nhuman fibrinogen concentrate in coronary artery bypass graft patients increased \nintraoperative and postoperative fibrinogen levels but did not reduce \npostoperative bleeding. Similar findings were reported in an RCT by Bilecen et al . [ 123 ]. Another study [ 124 ] also observed an increased risk of \nallogeneic blood product transfusion in patients receiving fibrinogen \nsupplementation during aortic surgery. Consequently, routine prophylactic use of \nhuman fibrinogen to reduce postoperative bleeding and transfusion requirements is \nnot recommended. However, for patients with confirmed hypofibrinogenemia, human \nfibrinogen concentrate is as effective as cryoprecipitate for fibrinogen \nsupplementation [ 125 , 126 ], with similar thromboembolic events reported in both \ngroups [ 127 ]. Given its ease of administration, high purity, cost-effectiveness, \nand strong efficacy in raising fibrinogen levels, human fibrinogen concentrate \nmay be preferred over cryoprecipitate in patients with hypofibrinogenemia \nfollowing CPB.\n\nCurrently, large-scale studies on perioperative platelet transfusion in \ncardiovascular surgery are lacking. One retrospective study [ 128 ] involving \n12,043 cardiovascular surgery patients found that platelet transfusion was \nassociated with reduced infection risk and shorter ICU and hospital stays. \nAnother retrospective study [ 129 ], which included 119,132 patients from 40 \ncenters, observed an association between platelet transfusion and lower \nin-hospital and 90-day mortality and reduced risks of deep wound infection and \nacute kidney injury. However, a separate study [ 130 ] indicated that in patients \nexperiencing massive bleeding post-CPB, sequential transfusion of four units of \nsingle-donor platelets increased platelet count but did not improve platelet \naggregation function or hemostasis.\n\nTherefore, more high-quality research is needed to provide stronger evidence on \nthe relationship between perioperative platelet transfusion and outcomes \nregarding hemostasis and prognosis.\n\n6. Autologous Blood Infusion\n\nQuestion 10. Should intraoperative cell salvage (ICS) be routinely \nused to reduce allogeneic transfusion?\n\nRecommendation 16. Routine use of ICS is recommended in cardiac surgery \n(strong recommendation, high certainty) .\n\nICS is the process of collecting the patient’s intraoperative blood loss, \nremoving cell debris, free Hb, and activated procoagulant inflammatory products \nthrough procedure steps including filtration, centrifugal separation, and \nwashing, and then reinfusing the blood to the patient [ 131 ]. Research has shown \nthat using ICS during cardiac surgery can reduce the amount of allogeneic blood \ntransfusions, lower the risk of transfusion-transmitted infections, and reduce \nhospitalization costs [ 132 , 133 , 134 ]. Meta-analysis suggests that ICS reduces the rate \nof allogeneic blood transfusion without increasing the requirement of fresh \nfrozen plasma or platelets [ 135 ]. Therefore, it is recommended that ICS be used \nroutinely.\n\nQuestion 11. Should autologous platelet-rich plasmapheresis (APP) be \nused before CPB to reduce allogenic transfusion?\n\nRecommendation 17. APP before CPB may be considered for patients with a \nhigh risk of post-CPB bleeding, stable hemodynamics, and normal platelet count \nand function (strong recommendation, moderate certainty) .\n\nCPB impairs the quality and quantity of platelets, especially in aortic surgery \nrequiring deep hypothermic circulatory arrest. Meanwhile, separating and \ncollecting the autologous platelets or platelet-rich plasma before CPB and \nreinfusing them after CPB is a way to preserve platelets. However, van der Wal et al . [ 136 ] demonstrated that this technique could neither reduce \nperioperative blood transfusion nor decrease blood loss in cardiac surgery. \nTriulzi et al . [ 137 ] found that although the postoperative blood loss \nwas reduced, perioperative allogeneic blood transfusion was not lowered. In \naddition, collecting adequate platelets or platelet-rich plasma from \napproximately 20%–30% of the total blood volume might lead to hemodynamic \ninstability, fluid overload, and severe hemodilution. Therefore, APP is not \nrecommended in cardiac surgeries with low bleeding risk. As for surgeries with \nhigh bleeding risk, such as aortic surgery, multiple studies [ 138 , 139 , 140 , 141 ] have shown \nthat autologous platelet-rich plasma transfusion can improve patients’ \ncoagulation function, reduce postoperative bleeding, and lower the incidence of \npulmonary and renal complications.\n\nQuestion 12. Should acute normovolemic hemodilution (ANH) be used to \nreduce allogenic transfusion?\n\nRecommendation 18: ANH should be used in patients with stable conditions \nwho anticipate prolonged CPB time or a high risk of bleeding (strong \nrecommendation, moderate certainty) .\n\nANH is a procedure in which a certain amount of autologous blood is collected \nfrom the patient after anesthesia induction and before systemic heparinization \nand then stored for later usage. At the same time, the crystalloid or colloid \nsolutions are infused to replace the blood volume and achieve moderate \nhemodilution. The stored autologous blood will be transfused back to the patient \nafter CPB or when the Hb level is below the transfusion threshold during CPB. ANH \ncould preserve autologous blood from activation and damage by CPB. In 2017, a \nmeta-analysis including 29 RCTs and 3439 patients showed that ANH can reduce the \nrate of perioperative allogeneic red blood cell transfusion and postoperative \nblood loss in adult cardiac surgery [ 142 ]. A meta-analysis in 2020 specifically \nfocusing on ANH use in coronary artery bypass graft surgery also arrived at a \nsimilar conclusion [ 143 ]. The ANH volume is essential as research has shown that \nhigh-volume ANH (12–15 mL/kg or ≥ 800 mL) is more effective in reducing \npostoperative bleeding and perioperative blood product transfusion [ 144 , 145 ]. \nComparatively, large-volume ANH might increase the risk of hemodynamic \ninstability during the ANH procedure, increase the degree of hemodilution, and \nlead to excessive fluid infusion. In addition, ANH should be performed before \nsystemic heparization. The method is time-consuming and requires continuous, \nclose hemodynamic monitoring, which is why ANH has not been widely implemented. \nThere is no unified consensus on the optional candidate for ANH. However, it \nmight be more suitable for patients with anticipated prolonged CPB time, high \nrisk of bleeding, and stable hemodynamics. Thus, closely monitoring hemodynamics, \nHb levels, and echocardiography is required during the implementation of ANH \n[ 146 ].\n\nQuestion 13. Should residual pump blood be transfused back into the \npatients?\n\nRecommendation 19. After CPB, the residual pump blood in the circuit \nshould be transfused back into the patients (strong recommendation, high \ncertainty) .\n\nResidual pump blood refers to the remnant blood in the circuit after weaning off \nCPB. A small-scale study showed that transfusing the residual pump blood back \ncould increase Hb levels, platelet counts, and fibrinogen levels in the blood and \nimprove the R-value , α angle, and maximum amplitude value of TEG [ 147 ]. \nThe residual pump blood can be directly transfused or transfused after \nultrafiltration or cell salvage processing. If the volume of residual pump blood \nis large, direct infusion will increase the patient’s fluid volume, while \nprocessing with ultrafiltration or ICS could reduce the volume. However, \nprocessing with ultrafiltration might increase plasma-free Hb levels, while \nprocessing with ICS might lead to the loss of plasma components and platelets. \nSome studies have compared the effects of three methods on allogeneic blood \ntransfusion and coagulation function but have not yet reached consistent \nconclusions [ 148 , 149 , 150 , 151 , 152 ]. Although the optimal method for processing or not \nprocessing the residual pump blood has yet to be determined, it is widely \nrecognized that residual pump blood is a valuable blood resource, and its \ntransfusion after the end of the CPB is a critical component in the PBM program. \nThese findings were supported by a study by Zhang et al . [ 9 ], which \ndemonstrated a comprehensive PBM program, including residual blood pump infusion, \ncould reduce the allogeneic transfusion rate.\n\n7. Conclusion\n\nImplementing a comprehensive PBM program in adult cardiac surgery under CPB \ncould reduce blood loss, decrease allogeneic transfusion, and improve patient \noutcomes. These guidelines are focused on PBM measures related to CPB. During the \ndevelopment of these recommendations, the cost-effectiveness, acceptability, and \nfeasibility of PBM measures in China were considered to facilitate a wide \nimplementation of a comprehensive PBM program throughout China, aiming to promote \nperioperative PBM programs among hospitals at all levels. The comparisons between \nthe 19 recommendations and those in other international guidelines are provided \nin Supplementary Material D . The guidelines issued by different regions \nand societies are generally similar in their core principles and recommendations. \nFurthermore, it is important to acknowledge that the evidence supporting certain \naspects of these recommendations remains conflicting or insufficient. These \nknowledge gaps underscore the need for high-quality clinical research to \nstrengthen the evidence base, including well-designed RCTs and large-scale \nobservational studies.",
