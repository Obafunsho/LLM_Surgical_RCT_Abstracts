  "title": "Long-term outcomes of electrocoagulation versus radiofrequency thermoablation for varicose veins",
  "abstract": "Objective: Thermoablation is increasingly being used as an alternative to traditional surgery for treating primary varicose veins. Electrocoagulation ablation (EA) of the great saphenous vein (GSV) has demonstrated effectiveness and safety comparable with that of radiofrequency ablation (RFA); however, its long-term outcomes have not been investigated previously.\n\nMethods: This study involves a long-term follow-up of patients who participated in a double-blind, randomized clinical trial. Individuals with lower limb varicose veins and incompetence of GSV were randomly assigned to two treatment groups: EA and RFA. Follow-up assessments were scheduled at 1 week, 3 months, 6 months, and annually thereafter. The primary outcome measured was GSV occlusion, evaluated through postoperative duplex ultrasound examination. Secondary outcomes included the complication rate and improvements in quality of life, assessed using the Aberdeen Varicose Vein Questionnaire score.\n\nResults: A total of 57 patients were included, which involved a cumulative 85 treated GSVs; 42 veins were treated with EA and 43 with RFA. At the 1-week, 3-month, and 6-month follow-ups, there were no statistically significant differences between the two groups regarding GSV occlusion rates ( P = .430, P = .157, and P = .157, respectively), complication rates ( P = .717, P = .317, and P = .320, respectively), or improvements in quality-of-life scores ( P = .540, P = .786, and P = .401, respectively). After a median follow-up duration of 4.8 years (95% confidence interval, 4.5-5.1 years), data for 59 procedures (69.4%) were available, showing occlusion rates of 89.7% for the EA group (n = 29) and 66.7% for the RFA group (n = 30) ( P = .001). There were no procedure-related complications ( P = .127) and no significant differences in the Aberdeen Varicose Vein Questionnaire scores ( P = .345) between the two groups analyzed.\n\nConclusions: EA has demonstrated effectiveness and safety for ablation of the GSV, achieving a higher rate of venous occlusion compared with RFA in the long-term follow-up. Additionally, the occurrence of complications and the impact on symptoms and quality of life were comparable between the two methods during long-term follow-up.",

  "full_text": "Methods\n\nStudy design\n\nThis report presents a long-term analysis of a prospective, double-blind, randomized, controlled trial conducted at the Dante Pazzanese Institute of Cardiology and the Adventist Hospital of São Paulo. The study protocol received approval from both local and national ethics committees, and written informed consent was obtained from all participants in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. Eligible participants included adults with primary chronic venous insufficiency, experiencing symptomatic venous reflux and varicosities (classified under the Clinical, Etiology, Anatomy, and Pathophysiology [CEAP] classification as symptomatic C2-C6) 16 and exhibiting incompetence of the GSV, with a reflux duration of ≥0.5 seconds determined via duplex ultrasound examination while standing. Key exclusion criteria included post-thrombotic syndrome, previous treatment of the GSV, symptomatic peripheral arterial disease, and a GSV diameter of >12 mm. The study was registered under ClinicalTrials.gov ( NCT02139085 ).\n\nAssessments\n\nBefore the intervention, investigators gathered a comprehensive vascular history, conducted a targeted physical examination, and completed assessments using both the CEAP classification and the Venous Clinical Severity Score (VCSS). 16 Duplex ultrasound examination of both legs was performed, and participants filled out the Aberdeen Varicose Vein Questionnaire (AVVQ), 17 , 18 with the exception of the first question, which was challenging to represent graphically, because of cognitive characteristics. Thus, the maximum score achievable for the AVVQ was 77.64215. 15\n\nRandomization\n\nParticipants were assigned randomly to either the EA or RFA group using sealed envelopes numbered from 1 to 100. A masked researcher placed a random number in each envelope; odd numbers were designated for RFA and even numbers for EA. The sequence for envelope opening was determined by a table of random numbers generated by the statistical department, with envelopes being opened at the time of anesthetic induction. The choice between a per-limb or per-patient randomization approach, depending on the specific clinical goals of the assessment. For a comprehensive assessment of a patient's overall quality of life, a per-patient approach is generally more appropriate, because it captures the broader impact of the disease on the individual's daily life and well-being. Therefore, randomization was conducted on a per-patient basis rather than per limb. 15\n\nDevices and procedures\n\nAll patients underwent surgery in an operating room under spinal anesthesia. GSV thermoablation and tributary phlebectomy were performed at the same session. EA was conducted using ultrasound-guided puncture of the GSV at the knee, followed by the retrograde placement of a 6F, 11-cm sheath and a straight 6F catheter directed toward the saphenofemoral junction. The distal tip of the catheter was positioned below the entrance of the superficial epigastric vein, or approximately 1.5 cm below the saphenofemoral junction when it was not identified. The electrocoagulator head (electrode) was then deployed by retracting the catheter, ensuring that only its four distal stems were in contact with the venous wall. Previous clinical studies demonstrated that the mean temperature on the outer surface of the saphenous vein undergoing electrocoagulation, without the use of perivenous tumescent anesthesia, was 47.3°C (range, 37°C-62°C). 13 At this temperature, there were no complications related to the procedure. 14 , 15 Therefore, perivenous tumescent anesthesia was used for RFA but not for EA. The distal end of the electrocoagulator was connected to an Electrosurgical Generator FX power source (Valley Lab, Boulder, CO), initiating ablation of the GSV with 60 W for 10 seconds, adjusting as necessary based on intraoperative ultrasound-guided feedback. The catheter and electrocoagulator were withdrawn altogether for every 2 cm during the procedure, until all the incompetent GSV segment was treated. Intraoperative duplex ultrasound examination allowed for real-time guidance and observation of signs indicating successful thermoablation. RFA was conducted using an intraluminal Closure FAST catheter featuring a 7-cm heating element. After tip positioning 2 cm from the saphenofemoral junction, segmental thermoablation was carried out at 120°C in 20-second cycles—two cycles for the proximal vein and any segments with a diameter of >8 mm, and one cycle for remaining segments. 19 At the conclusion of the procedure, four duplex ultrasound criteria were assessed, by the same operator, to determine the success of GSV thermoablation: reduction in lumen diameter, parietal thickening, lack of compressibility, and absence of flow in the treated segment via distal augmentation in a segment >5 cm. After appropriate hemostasis, the legs of all patients who underwent the procedures were bandaged with compression wraps (maintained for 48 hours) and patients were advised to wear elastic stockings and encouraged to walk.\n\nPostoperative visits\n\nIn the randomized controlled trial (RCT), participants were asked to return to the research facility at 7 days, at 3 and 6 months, and yearly thereafter. The 7-day follow-up visit included an assessment of analgesic use, complications, and endovenous heat-induced thrombosis (EHIT) was searched for by duplex ultrasound examination performed by an independent and masked investigator. The EHIT was classified according to the duplex ultrasound findings: I, thrombus extended up to and including the deep vein junction; II, thrombus propagation into de adjacent deep vein but comprising <50% of the lumen; III, thrombus propagation into de adjacent deep vein but comprising >50% of the lumen; and IV, occlusive deep vein thrombus contiguous with the treated superficial vein. No treatment or extensive surveillance was performed to EHIT I; no treatment was performed to EHIT II, but it was followed with weekly duplex ultrasound surveillance until thrombus resolution; and EHIT III and IV were treated with therapeutic anticoagulation for 3 months. At subsequent visits, investigators administered the VCSS, while participants completed the AVVQ. GSV patency was assessed during every follow-up using duplex ultrasound examination, with both patients and assessing physicians masked to the technique used. The patients were advised to return to the research center anytime if they experienced any symptoms or recurrence of symptomatic varicose veins.\n\nEnd points and statistical methods\n\nThe primary end point of the study was complete closure of the target GSV (occlusion), defined by the presence of four duplex ultrasound criteria as described. To calculate the minimum sample size, we considered that 100% of EA 14 cases and 80% of RFA cases would result in occlusion of the treated vessel (difference of 20%). We established that a sample size of 81 limbs could provide 95% statistical power at a 5% significance level. 15 Data analysis was performed using SPSS Statistics for Windows, version 17.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY). Categorical variables were reported as absolute values and percentages, while and continuous data were expressed as mean ± standard deviation and median (quartile) values. Comparisons between groups were conducted using chi-square tests for categorical variables and t tests for continuous variables with normal distribution. The results of the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test for normality established that the VCSS and AVVQ continuous variables were not distributed normally; consequently, the Mann-Whitney test was used for intergroup comparisons, and the Friedman and Wilcoxon tests were used for intragroup comparisons. A P value of <.05 was deemed statistically significant, except for within-group analyses of VCSS and AVVQ, where a P value of <.02 was considered significant.\n\nResults\n\nSubject characteristics and disposition\n\nA total of 57 patients were treated between November 2014 and May 2016, with 29 patients assigned to the RFA group and 28 to the EA group. A total of 85 GSVs were treated, 43 with RFA and 42 with EA. In the RFA group, the GSV was treated bilaterally in 14 patients, and 15 patients had only one GSV treated. In the EA group, GSV was treated bilaterally in 14 patients, and another 14 patients received the treatment in only one of their GSVs. Most participants were female (72%), and their ages ranged from 23 to 74 years, with a mean age of 49.54 years. No significant differences in demographics were observed between the two groups. Furthermore, there were no differences in the presence of deep venous system reflux, reflux in perforating veins, reflux at the saphenous-femoral junction, maximum treated GSV diameter, GSV depth, and CEAP classification 15 ( Table I ).\n\nOperative procedure characteristics\n\nIn the EA group, the mean treatment power was 75.7 ± 13.6 W, and the mean ablation duration was 8.3 ± 2.6 seconds. The average energy delivered during the procedure was 641.7 ± 261.3 J. The average lengths of ablated veins were 41 ± 5.8 cm for the EA group, compared with 38 ± 6 cm for the RFA group ( P = .027). The average procedure times were 93.5 ± 21 minutes for the EA group and 88 ± 18 minutes for the RFA group ( P = .218). All treated limbs (100%) demonstrated a reduction in venous diameter and thickening of the GSV wall as assessed by intraoperative duplex ultrasound examination, regardless of the ablation technique used. Specifically, 27.9% of patients in the RFA group had persistent venous flow after the procedure, whereas none in the EA group showed flow during intraoperative examinations with manual pressure applied to the calf. The difference in postablation venous flow between the groups was statistically significant ( P < .001). In terms of venous compressibility, 20.9% of limbs treated with RFA exhibited compressibility of the GSV, whereas none of the EA-treated limbs showed this condition. A significant difference in venous compressibility was noted between the two groups after treatment ( P < .001). The immediate procedural outcomes are summarized in Table II .\n\nProcedure follow-up\n\nAfter 1 week, all GSVs in the EA group demonstrated total occlusion, whereas four GSVs (9.3%) in the RFA group continued to show flow in a segment >5 cm ( P = .043). Two adverse events were reported in the RFA group that were not attributed to the procedure: one case of postspinal anesthesia headache treated successfully with a blood patch and one case of distal deep vein thrombosis in a nonstudy limb was treated with rivaroxaban. After the first week, the most common complication observed in both groups was paresthesia, with three cases reported in each group. One additional case of EHIT occurred in the RFA group. There were no significant differences in complication rates between the groups ( P = .717). The time taken for patients to resume their regular activities was significantly shorter in the EA group (4 days; interquartile range, 3-9 days) compared with the RFA group (6 days; interquartile range, 4.5-15.0 days; P = .026). At 3 months, all GSVs in the EA group remained completely occluded, whereas two GSVs (4.7%) in the RFA group still showed flow in segments >5 cm ( P = .157). At 6 months, all GSVs in the EA group continued to remain occluded, but two GSVs (4.7%) in the RFA group still exhibited flow in a segment >5 cm ( P = .157). No instances of GSV patency were observed after it had previously been classified as occluded. There were no complications reported in the EA group at the 6-month mark, although one lower limb (2.3%) in the RFA group continued to present paresthesia ( P = .320). After this period, most of the patients did not return for the scheduled subsequent visits; only three patients from the RFA group came back because they became symptomatic (15%) and required subsequent polidocanol foam treatment for varicose vein recurrence ( Table III ).\n\nLong-term follow-up\n\nWith the specific objective of evaluating the long-term outcome, we contacted all patients who underwent the RCT and asked them to attend for clinical and duplex ultrasound assessment. A total of 44 patients (77.2%) came back for evaluation. In the EA group, GSV was treated bilaterally in 10 patients, and 9 patients had only one GSV treated. In the RFA group, GSV was treated bilaterally in 11 patients, and another 8 patients received the treatment in only one of their GSVs. The great saphenous vein procedure follow-up rate was 67.4% for EA and 71.4% for RFA ( P = .33). We observed GSV occlusion rates of 89.7% for EA and of 66.7% for RFA procedures ( P = .01) after a median follow-up of 4.8 years (total 95% confidence interval [CI], 4.5-5.1; EA, 95% CI, 4.3-5.2; RFA, 95% CI, 4.4-5.3; P = .23). All recanalizations had small lumen (<3 mm) and normal hemodynamic function (no reflux). In three RFA cases, there was symptomatic recurrence of varicose veins (10.3%), all related to recanalized segment of previously treated incompetent GSV. Probably, they were missed tributaries during the primary phlebectomy procedures. Table III presents the rates of GSV patency and complications observed in the treated groups.\n\nQuality of life and disease severity\n\nImprovements in quality of life, as measured by the AVVQ, were similar across both groups. A significant difference was noted between preoperative AVVQ scores and those recorded across all follow-up periods, which was sustained in the long-term assessment ( Table IV ). Additionally, clinical improvements in disease severity, assessed via VCSS, were comparable for both groups. A significant difference was observed between preoperative VCSS scores and those recorded at all study intervals as well as during the long-term follow-up ( Table V ).\n\nDiscussion\n\nHistorically, surgeons have used electrocoagulation to achieve rapid and effective hemostasis and vessel occlusion. 20 Given the efficiency and quick results associated with open surgical external vessel electrocoagulation, our research team sought to investigate its application for endovascular vessel occlusion. Initial published outcomes were disappointing, with many studies reporting incidents of vessel rupture and/or low occlusion rates. 21 , 22 , 23 In 1996, an experimental study involving an endovascular catheter for the electrocoagulation of peripheral veins using a canine model reported, for the first time, successful occlusion of all treated veins with minimal surrounding tissue damage. 24\n\nIn our preliminary study, our electrocoagulator model demonstrated its ability to induce necrosis of the vessel layers selectively while sparing adjacent structures, indicating its potential safety. 12 This finding may be attributed to the fact that the basic passage of electric current through the tissue can induce cell death and necrosis, even without high temperatures, a phenomenon known as electromechanical effect. 25 , 26 , 27 The intensity of histological changes correlated positively with the energy levels used in electrocoagulation, as well as the power and duration of its application. Notably, we found that the temperatures reached in venous segments treated with electrocoagulation were significantly lower than those achieved with intravascular thermoablation methods such as EVLA and RFA. 13 Our optimal parameters for effective and safe venous ablation were determined to be 60 W for 10 seconds, which achieved necrosis primarily in the intimal and medial layers of the vessel, sparing the adventitia. 14\n\nClinical research using electrocoagulation is critical for establishing its efficacy in comparison with established gold standard procedures, such as RFA. The literature provides limited data on intraoperative GSV occlusion rates. In our study, 12 patients (27.9%) treated with RFA exhibited persistent flow immediately after venous ablation, whereas none in the EA group showed any flow at this stage. This difference may be explained partially by the median diameters of the treated veins, which averaged approximately 8 mm in our study compared with 5 to 6 mm in previously published studies. 6 , 28 , 29 Another consideration is that electrocoagulation does not require tumescent anesthesia, and the intraoperative ablation process can be monitored in real time using ultrasound guidance. This strategy allows for tailored energy application and procedure guidance based on immediate intraoperative observations. Moreover, the electromechanical phenomenon, characterized by the interaction of electrons with ions and molecules within biological tissues, may contribute significantly to venous injury during electrocoagulation, complementing the thermomechanical processes involved in cell death owing to elevated temperatures. 25 , 26 , 27\n\nThe high occlusion rate and low complication rates seen in the EA group lead us to conclude that the energy applied (mean treatment values of 75.7 ± 13.6 W for 8.3 ± 2.6 seconds) is appropriate for most cases, as shown in a previous publication. 14 We observed no instances of perioperative deep venous thrombosis or pulmonary embolism directly related to the target treatment. There were no reports of phlebitis, burns, or skin pigmentation changes. EHIT occurred in one patient (2.3%) in the RFA group and was managed successfully with rivaroxaban. Our findings indicate that electrocoagulation achieved faster GSV occlusion compared with RFA, intraoperatively ( P = .000), and in the first postoperative week ( P = .043), but this difference was not statistically significant at the 3-month ( P = .157) and 6-month ( P = .157) follow-ups. Throughout 1 week, 3 months, and 6 months, occlusion rates were notably high in both groups, reflecting equivalency between the EA and RFA procedures, with the RFA results aligning with existing literature. 28 , 29 , 30 , 31 Given that many patients with varicose veins are treated at a relatively young age, it is imperative to ensure long-term success of initial treatments to prevent disease recurrence.\n\nIn this study, the spontaneous follow-up rate after the first year of follow-up was very low. It is likely that this happened because most of patients enrolled in the RCT remained asymptomatic. Only after an active search, through telephone contact, did the patients present for clinical reassessment and duplex ultrasound examination. Notably, the GSV occlusion rate in the RFA group was lower than that reported in the literature. Proebstle et al 32 documented a 100% initial vein occlusion rate for 295 GSVs treated with RFA, with a 5-year occlusion rate of 91.9% based on Kaplan-Meier analyses. Lawaetz et al 33 found a RFA recanalization rate at 5 years of 5.8%. Our reoperation rate for the RFA group was 15%, which is comparable with the 17% rate observed by Lawaetz et al.\n\nIt is worth noting that all recanalizations noted in our study resulted in small lumens (<3 mm) with normal hemodynamic function (no reflux). Although recanalization constituted technical failures as defined by protocol, they did not revert patients to their pretreatment venous hemodynamics and had no clinical implications. Possible explanations for the difference in our occlusion rates after RFA compared with those in the literature 32 are (1) more stringent criteria established for assessing occlusion in the treated segment, particularly regarding the presence any of recanalization of >5 cm in the treated area, even without the presence of reflux; (2) the timing of the learning curve associated with intravenous treatment techniques during the implementation of the RCT protocol, because most of the varicose vein surgeries at our center were performed with surgical saphenectomies, although this latter factor would have impacted both treatment methods examined; (3) a significant loss to follow-up rate in the group undergoing RFA (28.6%); and (4) a high rate of CEAP C3 to C5 treated limbs, an independent predictor for postoperative GSV RFA recanalization. 34 Despite the variance in GSV occlusion rates between the methods investigated, we found no accompanying difference in quality of life (measured via AVVQ), disease severity (measured with VCSS), or reoperation rate.\n\nThe strengths of this study lie in its randomized, masked design and thorough assessments of clinical outcomes and symptom scoring, as well as the development of a new, cost-effective, and highly efficient device. However, several limitations should be acknowledged. Although evaluations performed in the postoperative periods were conducted by masked investigators, the intraoperative ultrasound assessments were not masked, because they were performed by same operator. This limitation does not alter the study's outcome, given that the primary end point was the long-term occlusion rate. Patient failure to attend annual visits significantly hindered our ability to conduct a comprehensive occlusion rate life table analysis. Without consistent monitoring and data collection over time, we were unable to gather the necessary information to accurately assess outcomes and trends. The average operative time for both procedures was longer than that documented previously. This extended duration may be due to several factors: the administration of spinal anesthesia and the simultaneous thermal ablation of the GSV and phlebectomy of tributary varices, as well as the requirement for thorough ultrasound evaluation of the established GSV occlusion criteria during the procedure. Currently, we are performing these procedures on an ambulatory basis using conscious sedation and local anesthesia at the puncture site with promising results. Complications were relatively infrequent, suggesting that a larger patient cohort may be necessary for more robust evaluations of the differences in complication rates between groups.\n\nConclusions\n\nElectrocoagulation proves to be an effective method for ablation of the GSV, offering a higher venous occlusion rate and a complication profile comparable to that of radiofrequency thermoablation, along with similar long-term quality-of-life outcomes.\n\nAuthor's note\n\nEA is not approved by the US Food and Drug Administration and, therefore, it is not appropriate to use on patients in the United States.\n\nAuthor contributions\n\nConception and design: FHR, CBB, MMT\n\nAnalysis and interpretation: FHR, CBB\n\nData collection: FHR, CBB, MMT\n\nWriting the article: FHR\n\nCritical revision of the article: FHR, CBB, MMT\n\nFinal approval of the article: FHR, CBB, MMT\n\nStatistical analysis: Not applicable\n\nObtained funding: Not applicable\n\nOverall responsibility: FHR\n\nFunding\n\nThis work was funded by the Dante Pazzanese Institute .
