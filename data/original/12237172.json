  "full_text": "Introduction\n\nSurgical procedures involving the head and neck region, as well as intraoral, maxillofacial, and dental procedures, usually require nasotracheal intubation (NTI).[ 1 ] Conventionally, NTI is performed by blindly passing an endotracheal tube (ETT) through one of the patient’s nostrils until the tube reaches the oropharynx after the induction of general anesthesia (GA). The tube is then navigated to the laryngeal opening using additional maneuvers, such as a burp, neck movement, tube rotation, the use of a bougie, or Magill’s or Boedeker forceps under laryngoscopic guidance.\n\nThis conventional method requires more intubation time due to the need for one or more maneuvers, which can trigger a hemodynamic stress response. While negotiating the ETT into the trachea, the use of Magill’s forceps may cause cuff damage or oropharyngeal soft tissue injury, further complicating the intubation process.[ 2 ]\n\nThe cuff inflation technique, first described by Gorback for blind nasal intubation, is a simple method in which the cuff of the tube is inflated with air, lifting it away from the posterior pharyngeal wall. The maneuver helps guide the tube from the oropharynx to the glottic inlet.[ 3 4 5 ] While the cuff inflation technique offers several benefits, it has not yet been routinely adopted in clinical practice.\n\nHence, we planned a study to compare the conventional and cuff inflation-deflation techniques of NTI. We hypothesized that the cuff inflation technique would result in faster intubation with reduced need for accessory manipulation compared to the conventional NTI technique. The primary aim of the study was to measure the time required for successful NTI using the two techniques. Secondary aims included comparing the types and number of maneuvers, hemodynamic responses, percentage of glottic opening (POGO) scores, and complications, if any, between the groups.\n\nMaterial and Methods\n\nThis prospective, randomized controlled study was approved by the Institutional Ethical Committee and registered with the Clinical Trial Registry-India. After obtaining written informed consent, 106 patients aged between 18 and 65 years, belonging to ASA physical status classes I and II and scheduled for elective surgeries requiring NTI, were enrolled. Patients were excluded if they had a mouth opening of less than 2.5 cm, anticipated difficult airway, nasal trauma, oropharyngeal tumor, basal skull fracture, history of laryngeal surgery or radiotherapy, frequent episodes of epistaxis, or refused to participate.\n\nThe study participants were randomly allocated to either the conventional group (Group C) or cuff inflation group (Group I) using the block randomization technique with a block size of 4 and a 1:1 allocation ratio. The randomization was performed by an investigator not involved in the study. Allocation concealment was achieved using an opaque sealed envelope technique, and the envelope was opened only after the patient was induced. The patency of the nostrils was assessed before anesthesia induction by comparing nasal airflow through each nostril. Patient assessed their airflow and chose the more patent nostril for NTI. Fifteen minutes before anesthesia induction, both the nostrils were decongested with 0.05% xylometazoline nasal drops.\n\nStandard American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) monitoring was applied to all patients in the operation theatre. In both the groups, a standardized general anesthesia (GA) protocol was followed. Induction was achieved with intravenous (IV) fentanyl 2 mcg/kg and IV propofol 2.5 mg/kg. After confirming adequate bag-and-mask ventilation, muscle relaxation was facilitated with IV rocuronium 0.6 mg/kg. Following adequate muscle relaxation, the selected nostril was lubricated with lignocaine jelly. A lubricated, wire-reinforced, fully deflated cuffed ETT (Mallinckrodt-Covidien, Dublin, Ireland) of appropriate size (7.5 mm internal diameter for males and 6.5 mm for females) was inserted through the floor of the nostril, with the concavity facing caudad, until its tip reached the oropharynx. Laryngoscopy was then performed using a C-MAC® video-laryngoscope (VL) to obtain a laryngeal view. The ETT was advanced into the laryngeal opening using one of two techniques, based on group allocation. To minimize inter-user variability, all intubations were performed by two experienced anesthesiologists who had successfully completed at least 50 nasal intubations using the C-MAC VL. These anesthesiologists were not part of the study. In Group C, the ETT was advanced through the vocal cords without any maneuver (M0) under C-MAC guidance [ Figure 1a ]. If difficulty persisted while passing the ETT through the vocal cords, accessory maneuvers were employed as needed. In Group I, once the ETT reached the oropharynx, the cuff was inflated with 15 mL of air by an assistant to align the tube with the laryngeal inlet, allowing it to engage with the glottis [ Figure 1b ]. The cuff was then deflated, and the ETT was guided through the glottis (M0). If difficulty was encountered in passing the ETT through the vocal cords, additional maneuvers were used according to the specific conditions. The following maneuvers were employed to align the ETT with the laryngeal opening under different circumstances. M1- backward, upward, and rightward pressure (BURP) was applied, M2- neck movement was used to enhance the alignment of the larynx with the glottis, M3- if the ETT tip became stuck in the laryngeal vestibule, it was rotated clockwise, M4- if the above maneuvers were unsuccessful, Magill’s forceps were used. The anesthetist performing the intubations was permitted to use any of the maneuvers based on the specific circumstances, without any sequence; thus, the maneuvers were not employed in a rigid manner. The analysis was limited to the total number of maneuvers performed.\n\nThree successive end-tidal CO2 waveforms confirmed the successful placement of the ETT. The duration of NTI was defined as the time taken from the confirmation of the ETT tip in the oropharynx by C-MAC VL to the appearance of three successive end-tidal CO2 waveforms. NTI durations longer than 150 s or more than three attempts at intubation during the procedure were considered failed NTI, after which intubation was attempted via the oral route. Any maneuver involving withdrawing of the tube from the nostril or use of another nostril was considered as one attempt. During the intubation procedure, hemodynamic monitoring heart rate [HR], systolic blood pressure [SBP], diastolic blood pressure [DBP], mean blood pressure [MBP], and oxygen saturation [SpO2]) was recorded every minute for the first 5 min after the induction of anesthesia and subsequently at 5-min intervals for the next 10 min.\n\nStatistical analysis\n\nThe sample size was calculated based on a previously published study done by Shah et al .[ 6 ] Assuming a clinical meaningful mean difference of 12 s and a standard deviation of 2 in intubation time between the two treatment groups, with 90% power and 5% significance, the sample size was estimated to be 53 patients per treatment group. As it was a one-time point study with no dropouts, 53 patients were recruited per treatment group, for a total of 106 patients across the two groups.\n\nSample Size (n) = [Z (1α) + Z (1−β)] 2 2 Sp 2\n\nμ2d\n\nSp = Pooled variance, μd = Mean difference between two groups;\n\nZ (1−β) =1.28 (as power is 90%)\n\nZ (1−α) =1.96 (as the significance level is 95%)\n\nN = 53 per treatment group.\n\nThe recorded data were stored in a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet and analyzed using SPSS version 23 (IBM Corp. Ltd, Newark, USA). Categorical data were presented as ratios or percentages. Continuous data were expressed as mean ± standard deviation. The Chi-square test was used to analyze categorical variables, while intergroup comparisons of mean changes in outcomes were evaluated using an unpaired t -test. A difference was considered significant if P < 0.05.\n\nResults\n\nIn this trial, 120 patients were screened, of which 14 were excluded as they did not meet the inclusion criteria. The remaining 106 patients were randomized into two groups and analyzed [ Figure 2 ]. There was no significant difference between the groups regarding age, weight, sex distribution, Cormack and Lehane grading, and body mass index [ Table 1 ]. Nasal intubation was successful in all patients. The time taken to navigate the ETT from the oropharynx to the glottis inlet was significantly shorter with the cuff inflation-deflation technique in Group I compared to Group C (41.11 ± 10.98 Vs 27.86 ± 4.47 s; P = <0.0001). All hemodynamic parameters were significantly higher at the 3 rd , 4 th , and 5 th min in Group C compared to Group I. [ Figure 3 ]. In Group I, maneuvers were required for successful NTI in only 13 patients, compared 28 patients in Group C ( P = 0.00277) [ Table 2 ]. None of the patients in Group I required the use of Magill forceps, where six patients in Group C needed assistance from Magill forceps for intubation . Five patients in Group I and eight patients in Group C experienced mild to moderate nasal bleeding. No patients in either group had severe nasal bleeding. Postoperative sore throat was observed in 10 patients in Group I and 22 in Group C.\n\nDiscussion\n\nIn this study, we observed that the time taken for intubation in patients with cuff-inflation deflation technique was significantly shorter than in patients where the conventional technique was used (27.86 s. vs. 41.11 s., P = 0.0001). Both techniques were done using C-MAC® video laryngoscope. Earlier studies have reported that C-MAC ® VL-guided NTI takes less time.[ 7 8 ] So, to compare cuff inflation method effectively, we have used C-MAC ® VL in both groups. Cuff inflation lifts the tip of the ETT from the posterior pharyngeal wall towards the laryngeal inlet, centralizing the tube in the oropharynx, which results in faster alignment and quick intubation. Our findings were consistent with those of Kasaudhan S et al .[ 9 ], who compared the time taken for ETT navigation from the oropharynx to the vocal cords using the cuff inflation method with both the Macintosh laryngoscope and C-MAC® video laryngoscope. They found that the time taken with the cuff inflation method in the C-MAC® video laryngoscope group was significantly lesser than in the Macintosh laryngoscope group. Our results were also consistent with those of Prashant et al. ,[ 10 ], who compared the cuff inflation method to curvature control modification in a thermo-softened ETT during NTI and found that the cuff inflation method resulted in significantly faster alignment with the glottis compared to the use of the modified tube.\n\nStudies reveal that the ETT does not adhere to the airway curvature and tends to remain along the posterior pharyngeal wall, making nasotracheal intubation difficult. [ 11 12 ] This necessitates the use of maneuvers or Magill forceps in 80% to 100% of cases to align the ETT with the laryngeal inlet. Lim et al .[ 13 ] used Magill forceps in 21/30 patients with the conventional technique and in 19/30 patients with the nasogastric tube-guided technique ( P = 0.785). Surprisingly, our results differ significantly. The cuff inflation technique reduced the need for additional maneuvers by raising the tip of the ETT from the posterior pharyngeal wall toward the laryngeal inlet. As a result, in Group I, no patients required Magill forceps, whereas 6/53 patients in Group C required them. This was also one of the reasons for faster intubation in the cuff inflation group.\n\nGlottic exposure and navigation of the tube from the nasopharynx to the laryngeal opening are important steps in NTI. We used the C-MAC® video laryngoscope in both groups, as it magnifies and improves the glottic view for the operator, providing extra space for tube manipulation.[ 14 15 ] Despite similar POGO score (100/50/0), which were 28/25/0 in Group C and 22/31/0 in Group I, the types of maneuver requirements were significantly higher in Group C (28/53) compared to Group I (13/53). The inflation of the cuff makes intubation faster by aligning the tube with the glottic opening, reducing the need for further manipulations.\n\nSt. Mont et al .[ 16 ] found that the videolaryngoscope provided a significantly better glottic view than the Macintosh ( P < 0.01), and the Macintosh laryngoscope required significantly more optimizing maneuvers. ( P < 0.01). Kwak et al .[ 17 ] reported that during Macintosh laryngoscopy, Magill forceps were required in 34% of patients for successful NTI, while only 6% of patients needed them when the McGrath VL was used. In a study done by Jones et al. ,[ 18 ] Magill forceps were used in 49% of patients for tube alignment with the Macintosh laryngoscope, while none were required when the GlideScope VL was used.\n\nKumar et al .[ 19 ] evaluated how cuff inflation affected the oropharyngeal navigation of three different stiffness ETTs during direct laryngoscope-guided NTI. Using this method of NTI, they observed that 94.5% (86/91) of all malaligned ETTs could be correctly realigned with cuff inflation. Our results were similar to those of Kumar et al . [ 19 ], as cuff inflation correctly realigned 75% (40/53) of cases, although we used video laryngoscopy in our study.\n\nHemodynamic parameters remained stable in the group where the cuff inflation-deflation technique was used. During intubation, Group C exhibited higher blood pressure and heart rate compared to Group I at 3 to 6 min after anesthesia induction. This can be attributed to the sympathetic stimulation caused by airway manipulation in Group C during intubation. Additionally, the longer intubation time and the use of maneuvers in Group C directly contributed to the hemodynamic changes. Similar findings were observed in a study by Kasaudhan S et al. ,[ 9 ] where the group using the Macintosh laryngoscope had significantly higher hemodynamic parameters at 3 min compared to the Group using the C-MAC video laryngoscope.\n\nOur study has a few limitations. First, we enrolled only healthy, anesthetized, and paralyzed patients with normal airways; thus, our results may not be applicable to patients with difficult airways. Second, blinding of the anesthesiologist performing NTI was not possible due to the obvious differences between the two techniques. However, we believe that this did not affect our results, as all parameters were measured objectively, and there is less likelihood of operator bias. Third, all the intubations were performed by experienced anesthesiologists, so inexperienced operators may not reciprocate the similar results.\n\nConclusions\n\nThe cuff inflation method requires significantly less time for NTI than the conventional method. Additionally, the cuff inflation method provides faster alignment with the glottis inlet, a lower hemodynamic response, little to no need for maneuvers, and fewer complications.\n\nConflicts of interest\n\nThere are no conflicts of interest.",
