  "title": "Pacemaker Implantation Associated with Tricuspid Repair in the Setting of Mitral Valve Surgery: Insights from a Cardiothoracic Surgical Trials Network Randomized Trial",
  "abstract": "Objectives:: In a recent trial, tricuspid annuloplasty (TA) during mitral surgery (MVS) for degenerative mitral regurgitation (MR) and moderate or less tricuspid regurgitation (TR) reduced the composite rate of death, re-operation for TR, or TR progression at 2 years. However, this benefit was counterbalanced by an increase in permanent pacemakers (PPM). Here, we analyze the timing, indications, and risk factors for these implantations.\n\nMethods:: We randomized 401 patients (MVS alone=203; MVS+TA=198). Potential risk factors for PPMs were assessed using multivariable time-to-event models with death and PPM implantation for heart failure indications as competing risks.\n\nResults:: A PPM was implanted in 36 patients (9.6%; 95 CI 6.8%−13.0%) within 2 years of randomization, with 30/187 (16.0%) in the MVS+TA and 6/188 (3.2%) in the MVS groups (RR 5.08; 95% CI 2.16–11.94; p<0.001). The majority (29/36, 80.6%) of implants occurred within 30 days postoperatively. Independent risk factors for PPMs within 2 years were TA (HR 5.94; 95% 2.27–15.53; p<0.001), increasing age (5 years, HR 1.23; 95% CI 1.01–1.52; p=0.04), and LVEF (HR 0.96; 95% CI 0.92–0.99; p=0.02). In the subset of TA recipients (n=197), age (5 years, HR 1.05; 95% CI 1.00–1.10; p=0.04) and LVEF (HR 0.95; 95% CI 0.91–0.99; p=0.01) were associated with PPM within 2 years.\n\nConclusions:: Concomitant TA, age, and baseline LVEF were risk factors for PPM implantation in patients undergoing MV surgery for degenerative MR. While TA was effective in preventing progression of TR, innovation is needed to identify ways to decrease PPM rates.",
