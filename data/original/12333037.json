  "abstract": "Objective: Renal dysfunction is the most common risk factor for patients with coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). The aim of this research was to evaluate the prognosis and mid-term outcomes in CABG patients with mild renal dysfunction.\n\nMethods: Patients undergoing isolated CABG from July 2020 to December 2022 in Nanjing First Hospital were selected into this cohort study and divided into normal renal function group (eGFR ≥ 90 mL/min/1.73 m 2 , corresponding to CKD G1) and mild renal dysfunction group (eGFR: 60–89 mL/min/1.73 m 2 , corresponding to CKD G2). Propensity score matching was used to balance the differences. The primary outcomes were acute kidney injury (AKI) and all-cause mortality in follow-up, while the secondary outcomes were perioperative mortality and major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular event (MACCE) including death, stroke, myocardial infarction, and revascularization.\n\nResults: Totally 1,097 patients were enrolled in this study and 416 (33.3%) had mild renal dysfunction. A total of 379 pairs were included to the analysis after propensity score matching. Compared with the normal renal function, patients with mild renal dysfunction had more AKI after CABG (26.1% vs. 18.7%, p = 0.015), however, the perioperative mortality (1.3% vs. 1.3%, p = 1.00) was not significantly different. At 3-year follow-up, there were also no significant differences in all-cause mortality (6.3% vs. 4.8%, log-rank p = 0.33, HR 1.38, 95%CI: 0.721–2.652) and MACCE rates (10.2% vs. 7.6%, log-rank p = 0.19, HR 1.42, 95%CI: 0.836–2.414).\n\nConclusion: For patients undergoing CABG, preoperative renal dysfunction is associated with an increased risk of postoperative AKI. However, no significant difference was observed in perioperative mortality and mid-term outcomes.",

  "full_text": "Methods\n\nPatients\n\nThe prospective cardiac surgery database conducted by Nanjing First Hospital (Jiangsu, China) maintains the data on all cardiac operations performed in the hospital. We retrospectively collected consecutive patients with first-time isolated CABG from July 2020 to December 2022. The exclusion criteria of this research were (1) concomitant surgery, including valve surgery, aorta surgery, congenital heart surgery, etc, (2) patients with moderate to severe renal dysfunction (eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73m 2 ), (3) reoperation patients. As this was a retrospectively study, the informed consent was not required. All clinical data and follow-up outcomes were acquired with approval of the Ethics committee of Nanjing First Hospital (KY20170811-03).\n\nThe serum creatinine before the surgery were used as the baseline renal function (highest values were used if has repeated measurement.). The eGFR was calculated by the abbreviated Modification of Diet in Renal Disease equation: eGFR = 186 × Scr − 1.154 × age − 0.203 [ × 0.742 ( if female ) ] [ 14 ]. Patients were classified according to the eGFR values as normal kidney function group (eGFR ≥ 90 mL/min/1.73 m 2 , corresponding to CKD G1) and mild renal dysfunction group (eGFR: 60–89 mL/min/1.73 m 2 , corresponding to CKD G2).\n\nOutcomes and definition\n\nThe primary outcomes were the cardiac surgery associated acute kidney injury and all-cause mortality in the follow-up, while the secondary outcomes included the perioperative mortality and major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events (MACCE).\n\nThe diagnose of cardiac surgery-associated AKI followed Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) criteria [ 15 ] within 7 days after the surgery: (1) An increase in serum creatinine by ≥26.5 μmol/L within 48h or, (2) An increase in serum creatinine to ≥1.5 times baseline levels, which is known or presumed to have occurred within the prior 7 days or, (3) Urine volumes <0.5 mL/kg/h for 6h.\n\nMACCE was defined as the composite endpoint of all-cause death, stroke, myocardial infarction and revascularization.\n\nStatistical analysis\n\nCategorical variables are presented as absolute numbers and percentages and continuous variables as mean (SD) or median (interquartile range) according to the data normality distribution. Comparisons for categorical variables were performed using Chi-squared test or Fisher’s exact tests as appropriate. For continuous variables, student’s t -test were used for normally distributed variables and the Mann-Whitney U test was used for non-normally distributed variables.\n\nPropensity score matching (PSM) was used to adjust for the difference between baseline characteristics and reduce the impact of potential confounders. A multivariate logistic regression was done to calculate the propensity score for each patient. The covariate in the logistic regression included following variables: age, sex, body mass index (BMI), smoke, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, previous stroke, angina, acute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction, New York Heart Association heart functional class, history of percutaneous coronary intervention, left ventricular ejection function (LVEF, as continuous variable), triple-vessel diseases or not and left main diseases or not. 1:1 greedy nearest neighbor matching with a caliper of 0.2 were performed to identify each propensity score matched pair. Adequate balance of covariate distribution between the matched groups was assessed by standard mean differences (SMDs) with SMD < 0.1 was considered well balanced and graphically assessed using frequency histogram and love plot for data before and after PSM ( Supplemental Figure 1 ).\n\nLogistic regression was utilized to calculate the odds ratio (OR) and the 95% confidence interval (CI) for the eGFR groups and incidence of AKI after surgery and adjusted for multiple variables in the post-PSM cohort. Model 1 represented the unadjusted analysis, while the Model 2 involved adjustments for age, sex, and BMI. Model 3 incorporated variables from Model 2 and further adjusted for additional factors in the propensity score analysis. Further analysis was conducted by subdividing the mild renal dysfunction group (eGFR: 60–69, 70–79, and 80–89 mL/min/1.73m 2 ) in the original cohort. Moreover, subgroup analyses including age (≤65 versus >65 years), sex (male versus female), hypertension, diabetes mellitus, LVEF (<50% versus ≥50%) and cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) or not were performed to explore the consistency of the prognosis value of the mild renal dysfunction in the whole cohort. Likelihood ratio tests were used to assess the relationship between groups and variables used for stratifications.\n\nTime-to-event data was calculated by Kaplan-Meier estimates and compared using log-rank test. Cox regression analyses were performed in the propensity score cohort to compare the all-cause death and MACCE in the mid-term follow-up and hazard ratios (HRs) with their 95% CIs were reported (all HRs are reported as mild renal dysfunction group vs. normal kidney function group, with valves >1 indicating a high risk for the mild renal dysfunction group). The similar analysis was conducted in the subdividing group from the original cohort.\n\nAll analyses were performed using IBM SPSS 26.0 and R software (version 4.3.2) and p < 0.05 was considered as statistically significant difference.\n\nResults\n\nBaseline characteristics and propensity score matching\n\nTotally 1867 patients underwent CABG since July 2020 to December 2022 in Nanjing First Hospital. After the exclusion, there were 1097 patients included in this research finally (Detail flow chart of the study is shown in Figure 1 ). According to the preoperative serum creatinine, 681 had normal renal function while 416 patients (33.3%) had mild renal dysfunction.\n\nThe baseline characteristics of both groups are shown in Table 1 . Compared with the normal kidney function group, patients in the mild renal dysfunction group were elder (67.12 vs. 62.65 years, p < 0.001), more female (33.9% vs. 24.6%, p < 0.001), exhibited more hypertension, angina, triple-vessel disease, lower preoperative left ventricular ejection function (all p < 0.05). The other characteristics were not significantly different. The characteristics of the propensity score matching cohorts are also presented in Table 1 . After PSM, there were a total of 379 pairs formed and all clinical covariates showed comparable balance.\n\nSurgical information and postoperative in-hospital outcomes\n\nWhen taking 379 pairs after PSM into analysis, there were no significant differences in operative time, use of cardiopulmonary bypass and its duration, and intraoperative blood transfusion between groups ( p > 0.05, Table 2 ). In terms of the postoperative in-hospital outcomes, AKI was more common in the mild renal dysfunction group (26.1% vs. 18.7%, p = 0.015). No statistically significant differences were found in length of ICU stay, low cardiac output syndrome, postoperative atrial fibrillation and mechanical ventilation >24h. The in-hospital death also did no differ between groups (1.3% vs. 1.3%, p = 1.00). The same results were found in the analysis of the original cohort ( Supplemental Table 1 ).\n\nPrimary outcome\n\nFrom Univariate logistic regression, we could find that, mild renal dysfunction was the independent risk factor for the development of AKI after CABG (OR: 1.534, 95%CI: 1.086–2.116, p = 0.015) ( Table 3 ). Multivariable logistic regression also demonstrated a statistically significant association between the risk of AKI and preoperative mild renal dysfunction in the simplified model adjusted for demographic characteristics (OR: 1.531, 95%CI: 1.082–2.166, p = 0.016) and the fully adjusted model further adjusting for clinical history in the simplified model (OR: 1.601, 95%CI: 1.122–2.284, p = 0.009).\n\nFurthermore, considering subdividing the patients in mild renal dysfunction group (eGFR: 60–69, 70–79 and 80–89 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ) in the original cohort, the lower eGFR showed a significant association between the risk of AKI after CABG in both the unadjusted model (eGFR: 80–89 mL/min/1.73 m 2 vs. ≥90 mL/min/1.73 m 2 : OR: 1.429, 95%CI: 0.928–2.200, p = 0.105; eGFR: 70–79 mL/min/1.73 m 2 vs. ≥90 mL/min/1.73 m 2 : OR: 2.723, 95%CI: 1.818–4.079, p < 0.001; eGFR: 60–69 mL/min/1.73 m 2 vs. ≥90 mL/min/1.73 m 2 : OR: 2.253, 95%CI: 1.375–3.690, p = 0.001) and the fully adjusted model (eGFR: 80–89 mL/min/1.73 m 2 vs. ≥90 mL/min/1.73 m 2 : OR: 1.284, 95%CI: 0.818–2.016, p = 0.255; eGFR: 70–79 mL/min/1.73 m 2 vs. ≥90 mL/min/1.73 m 2 : OR: 2.375, 95%CI: 1.550–3.641, p < 0.001; eGFR: 60–69 mL/min/1.73 m 2 vs. ≥90 mL/min/1.73 m 2 : OR: 1.744, 95%CI: 1.027–2.963, p = 0.040)( Table 3 ).\n\nMoreover, we conducted a risk stratification analysis of the mild renal dysfunction for the AKI in multiple subgroups, based on sex, age, hypertension, diabetes, LVEF and CPB use ( Figure 2 ). The result showed the similar influence in most subgroups. Notably, in the age subgroup, patients with age >65 years displayed a significant association between mild renal dysfunction and AKI than younger patients (OR: 1.99, 95%CI:1.30–3.07, p = 0.03, P for interaction =0.033). Additionally, no relationship between mild renal dysfunction and subgroup was found in the analysis.\n\nFollow-up outcomes\n\nIn the 3-years follow-up, the Kaplan-Meier estimate all-cause death in the mild renal dysfunction (6.3% [95% CI: 3.5%-8.9%]) was higher than patients with normal kidney function (4.8% [95% CI: 2.4%-7.1%]). However, no significant difference was observed with log-rank test (log-rank p = 0.33, HR 1.38, 95%CI: 0.721–2.652) ( Figure 3(A) and Table 4 ). There were also no differ in cumulative incidence of MACCEs between groups (10.2% vs. 7.6%, log-rank p = 0.19, HR 1.42, 95%CI: 0.836–2.414) ( Figure 3(B) and Table 4 ). Similar results were found in the original cohort ( Supplemental Figure 2 ).\n\nMeanwhile, further analyses were taking when subdividing the mild renal dysfunction group. The results showed that, comparing with normal kidney function group, patients with eGFR in 60–69 mL/min/1.73 m 2 had higher rate of all-cause death (9.1% vs. 4.4%, HR 2.43, 95%CI: 1.089–5.444, p = 0.03. Figure 3(C) and Table 4 ) and MACCEs (15.9% vs. 6.8%, HR 2.34, 95%CI: 1.219–4.502, p = 0.01. Figure 3(D) and Table 4 ), while patients with eGFR in 70–79 and 80–89 mL/min/1.73 m 2 showed no significant difference.\n\nDiscussion\n\nIn this retrospective cohort study, we observed that patients exhibiting mild renal dysfunction demonstrated increased susceptibility to acute kidney injury during the early postoperative phase following coronary artery bypass grafting. However, their rates of perioperative and mid-term mortality, as well as MACCE, were comparable to those of patients with normal kidney function. Additionally, within this specific patient subset, individuals with an eGFR of 60–69 mL/min/1.73m 2 were found to have an elevated risk of developing AKI and experienced higher mortality rates subsequent to CABG surgery.\n\nAKI is one of the most common and severe complications following CABG, with an incidence rate ranging from 5% to 42% [ 16 , 17 ]. Preoperative severe renal dysfunction has been demonstrated an independent risk factor for AKI following CABG [ 17 , 18 ]. Our findings indicate that patients with mild renal dysfunction are more vulnerable to perioperative AKI compared to those with normal renal function, consistent with prior research [ 19 ]. This underscores the significance of preoperative renal function status in determining postoperative renal outcomes after CABG. A variety of factors may be implicated in this phenomenon, and several analyses of potential contributing elements are presented below: (1) The effects of extracorporeal circulation on renal perfusion, which may result from non-pulsatile blood flow to the kidneys, relative hypoperfusion of renal tissue, ischemia-reperfusion injury, endotoxemia, and the increased administration of blood products postoperatively [ 20 ]; (2) Perioperative management practices, including instances of hypotension and the utilization of diuretics and vasoconstrictive agents, which may further aggravate renal injury [ 21 ]; (3) Inflammatory and immune responses triggered by surgical trauma, ischemia-reperfusion injury to renal tissues, and endotoxemia, which stimulate inflammatory reactions during surgery, leading to the release of inflammatory mediators, adhesion molecules, and pro-inflammatory cytokines that exacerbate cellular damage [ 22 ].\n\nHowever, it is noteworthy that despite a significantly increased incidence of AKI in patients with mild renal dysfunction, no significance difference in perioperative mortality was observed. Similarly, no significance differences were found in all-cause mortality and MACCE rates between two groups during the near-midterm follow-up. Early studies [ 9 , 23 ] have consistently suggested that mild renal dysfunction may also be a risk factor affecting CABG outcomes: In the group with mild renal dysfunction, the all-cause mortality rate increases significantly with the rise in serum creatinine levels. At the same time, patients with mild renal dysfunction have a significantly higher incidence of new need for renal replacement therapy and stroke compared to the group with normal renal function.\n\nNonetheless, the results presented in our study, along with findings from several recent investigations [ 12 , 13 , 24 ], have progressively refuted this assertion. Our observations indicated that patients exhibiting normal renal function and those with mild renal dysfunction experienced similar long-term treatment outcomes subsequent to CABG. In contrast, the group characterized by moderate to severe renal impairment presented with markedly elevated risks of adverse events. This may be related to the increasing number of measures aimed at protecting renal function in recent years: target-directed perfusion to maintain oxygen delivery (DO2) ≥280 mL/min/m 2 during extracorporeal circulation can effectively increase renal oxygen supply during periods of low perfusion, thereby reducing the degree of renal function impairment and the incidence of postoperative AKI [ 25 ]. Furthermore, appropriately increasing the flow rate and avoiding lower hematocrit levels during extracorporeal circulation, or administering a certain amount of glutamate during the reperfusion period can also protect renal function to some extent [ 26 , 27 ]. With the improvement of these surgical strategies and perioperative management protocols, patients can still achieve favorable outcomes with no increased mortality, despite they suffer mild renal dysfunction preoperatively.\n\nAfter further refining the stratification of eGFR, our analysis revealed that a reduced eGFR in the range of 60–69 mL/min/1.73m 2 was associated with a notable increase in both mortality and MACCE, suggesting that these individuals may be on the cusp of ‘renal functional decompensation’. This underscores the need for more proactive perioperative management in this population. Enhancing preoperative blood pressure and glucose regulation to improve renal perfusion [ 28 ]; utilizing goal-directed perfusion and autologous blood priming during postoperative care to mitigate renal damage [ 25 ]; early detection and treatment of postoperative AKI may contribute to better outcomes for those with mild renal dysfunction.\n\nDespite the inclusion of a large sample size and the utility of propensity score matching to reduce error in our study, the inherent bias of retrospective research cannot be completely avoided. The selected bias would occur in a single-center cohort, affecting the robustness of the conclusion, whereas some confounding bias from unknown confounders could not be avoided despite the use of PSM. This may require multicenter, prospective studies to increase the evidence level of the conclusions. Meanwhile, this study mainly explored medium-term outcomes, and in the results, we observed that those with mild renal dysfunction seemed to have a higher trend of all-cause mortality and MACCE incidence. This might suggest the need for longer-term follow-up to further investigate the potential impact of renal function status on the long-term prognosis of coronary disease patients.\n\nConclusion\n\nThis study demonstrates that, for patients undergoing CABG, preoperative renal dysfunction is associated with a higher incidence of AKI, but there is no significant difference in perioperative mortality and the mid-term outcomes. Integrating personalized care and targeted management strategies may reduce the risk of AKI and improve prognosis in these patients. Further research focusing on nephroprotective strategies can be undertaken to improve clinical care and outcomes for these patients.",
