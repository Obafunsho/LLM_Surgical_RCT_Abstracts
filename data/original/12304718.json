  "title": "The effect of tranexamic acid on blood coagulation in primary total hip arthroplasty using rotational thromboelastometry: a randomized controlled trial",
  "abstract": "Background: Tranexamic acid (TXA), is commonly administered prophylactically to reduce blood loss in patients undergoing total hip arthroplasty (THA). However, its effect has never been studied. We hypothesized that no difference exists in the degree of fibrinolysis and blood loss between patients receiving prophylactic TXA and placebo.\n\nMethods: This double-blinded randomized-controlled trial included 50 patients undergoing primary THA in 2021–2023. Clinicaltrials.gov ( NCT03897621 ). Rotational-thromboelastometry (ROTEM) were performed to test blood coagulability using non citrated whole blood (NATEM) and blood treated with TXA (T-APTEM). The intervention group received TXA intravenously. The placebo group received 0.9% sodium chloride solution. The primary outcome measure was to quantitate the degree of fibrinolysis measured by maximum lysis (ML) demonstrated by ROTEM variables. Fibrinolysis was defined as ML (maximum lysis) > 15% within 1 h of testing.\n\nFindings: Blood coagulability tested by ROTEM was within the normal range in all patients, and no difference was found between the TXA group and placebo group. NATEM and T-APTEM variables were similar in both groups and no patient developed fibrinolysis during the entire perioperative phases. At baseline, T-APTEM, compared with NATEM, showed shorter CT (746 ± 265 vs. 991 ± 237 p < 0.05) and greater ML (1.9 ± 2.2 vs. 0.8 ± 1, p < 0.05), suggesting some degree of acceleration of coagulation. Postoperatively, blood coagulability showed a tendency of acceleration with shorter CT (689 ± 188 vs. 828 ± 163, p < 0.05) and CFT (258 ± 101 vs. 293 ± 87 p < 0.05) and increased A10 (41 ± 9 vs. 38 ± 8, p < 0.05). Clinical outcomes, including blood loss, hematologic variables, and coagulation profile were similar between the two groups.\n\nInterpretation: Normal range of blood coagulability in all patients, no significant differences between NATEM and T-APTEM variables, and similar clinical outcome between the two groups suggest that there is no definitive medical indication for TXA administration in patients undergoing THA without a preexisting fibrinolytic condition. Monitoring blood coagulability using ROTEM may be useful in guiding selective administration of TXA in high-risk patients.\n\nFunding: Department of Anesthesiology funding, 10.13039/100008513 Thomas Jefferson University Hospital .

  "full_text": "Introduction\n\nOver 300,000 total hip arthroplasties (THA) are performed yearly in the United States, and it is complicated by moderate blood loss ranging from 300 to 2000 mL. To minimize bleeding, tranexamic acid (TXA) is frequently administered prophylactically to patients undergoing THA and other major orthopedic surgeries to inhibit fibrinolysis or shift the coagulation balance toward the thrombophilic condition. 1 This practice has expanded to other fields of medicine including obstetrics, trauma, spine, urology, and other major surgeries. 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 TXA is a synthetic analog of lysine and inhibits fibrinolysis by reversibly binding to lysine receptor sites on plasminogen.\n\nHowever, the role of fibrinolysis in THA and the effectiveness of TXA in inhibiting fibrinolysis have not been studied. Existing studies used the reduction of estimated blood loss (EBL), lesser reduction of hemoglobin level after surgery, and lesser transfusion of packed red blood cell (PRBC) as a surrogate for the effectiveness of prophylactic TAX administration. 10 , 11 , 12 , 13 , 14\n\nThese clinical variables, however, can be used as surrogate measures of fibrinolysis only when the degree of fibrinolysis correlates positively with bleeding. Further, EBL is unreliable, inaccurate and is a poor indicator of the relationship between a treatment mode and patient outcomes. 15 , 16 Although the primary outcome measure of TXA administration should be inhibition of fibrinolysis, none of the clinical studies investigated the presence of fibrinolysis before TXA administration or its inhibition after TXA. 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 Hence, it remains unclear whether any changes in surrogate measures were caused by surgical bleeding or medical bleeding induced by fibrinolysis. Further, some patients might have received TXA without fibrinolysis. Administration of TXA is not without complications such as thromboembolic complications, mortality, seizure activity and accidental intrathecal injection. 17 , 18 , 19\n\nThe primary aim of this study was to determine the effects of prophylactic TXA administration on the degree of fibrinolysis via rotational thromboelastometry (ROTEM) by comparing the degree of fibrinolysis before and after prophylactic TXA. ROTEM is a variant of thromboelastograph developed in 1948. It measures shear elasticity of whole blood and has been used for patients undergoing liver transplantation and other clinical settings requiring whole blood coagulation monitoring. It is known to be close to the ideal monitoring tool detecting fibrinolysis in whole blood. The secondary aim was to evaluate the effects of prophylactic TXA administration on clinical outcome, including blood loss, blood transfusion requirement, changes in perioperative laboratory values, wound infection, hematoma formation, and thrombotic events.\n\nWe hypothesized that no difference exists in the degree of fibrinolysis and blood loss between patients receiving prophylactic TXA and placebo.\n\nMethods\n\nTrial design\n\nThis study was approved by the University's institutional research review board (IRB: #18D.581) and written informed consent was obtained from all subjects participating in the trial. The trial was registered prior to patient enrollment at clinicaltrials.gov ( NCT03897621 ), and was conducted in accordance with Good Clinical Practice guidelines and the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. This is a double-blinded randomized placebo-controlled trial. Safety of the participants and evaluation of the benefit–risk balance was overseen by an independent data and safety monitoring board. Participants were recruited from the outpatient clinic, and written informed consent was obtained.\n\nParticipants\n\nInclusion criteria were patients aged 18–85 years who were in the American Society of Anesthesiologists Physical Status 1–3 and undergoing unilateral, primary THA. General or spinal anesthesia was provided based on preference of surgeons and patients.\n\nExclusion criteria included refusal by the patient, patients with abnormal coagulation laboratory values, and anticoagulation therapy (aspirin, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, warfarin sodium, apixaban, etc.). Additionally, patients with a history of thrombotic complications, such as myocardial infarction, coronary artery disease, coronary artery stent placement, atrial fibrillation/flutter, stroke, deep venous thrombosis, or pulmonary embolism, were excluded. Other exclusion criteria were patients with history of seizure, active cancer, female patients who are pregnant or nursing, patients with anemia (Hb < 8 g/dL), and blood transfusion within one week before surgery.\n\nIntervention\n\nPatients were randomly allocated either to the TXA group or placebo group. Patients in the TXA group received TXA intravenously (a bolus of 10 mg/kg or maximal dose of 1 g) after induction of anesthesia. The placebo group patients received 0.9% sodium chloride solution (a bolus of 0.1 mL/kg). Venous blood specimens (8 mL) were obtained three times via an indwelling peripheral IV catheter to measure laboratory and ROTEM variables: (1) After induction of anesthesia [Baseline], (2) 45 min after drug administration [Drug + 45], (3) One hour after the end of surgery [Surgery + 60]. Non-citrated whole blood rotational thromboelastometry (ROTEM) was performed at the Anesthesiology Coagulation Laboratory within 4 min of blood collection. Two channels of ROTEM (NATEM and T-APTEM) were performed. NATEM was performed using 300 μl non-citrated whole blood without adding any chemical agents to avoid coagulation activation via calcium or activators. For T-APTEM, TXA (44.8 μg in 20 μl of saline) was added to the whole blood specimen before testing to inhibit fibrinolysis. This calculation was based on a 70 kg ideal body weight patient with a 5 L blood volume and a TXA dose of 10 mg/kg. Two ROTEM channels (NATEM and T-APTEM) were compared to exaggerate the presence of fibrinolysis. If fibrinolysis was present, NATEM would show fibrinolysis while APTEM would not. Additionally, prevention of fibrinolysis in TXA treated blood (T-APTEM) in vitro , may justify the administration of TXA to the patient.\n\nMeasured ROTEM variables are shown in Fig. 2 .\n\nEnd points\n\nThe primary outcome measure was to quantitate the degree of fibrinolysis measured by maximum lysis (ML) demonstrated by ROTEM variables in the two groups of patients. Fibrinolysis was defined as ML (maximum lysis) > 15% within 1 h of testing.\n\nSecondary outcome measures were EBL, blood transfusion requirement, perioperative changes in hemoglobin, platelets, PT, INR, aPTT, fibrinogen, Di-dimer, and postoperative thrombotic events (pulmonary embolism and deep venous thrombosis) until discharge from the hospital. EBL was calculated using the method described by Choi et al. 20 (volume of blood and fluid in the suction bottle − amount of irrigation fluid) + amount of blood on the surgical field + amount of blood on surgical pads (fully soaked: 20 mL; half soaked: 10 mL).\n\nRandomization, allocation concealment, blinding\n\nComputer randomization was conducted in a 1:1 ratio with a permuted block design with block sizes of two and four. An opaque envelope was used for allocation concealment. Patient enrollment, allocation concealment, and assignment as per randomization were independently performed by research staff. Patients, surgeons, and anesthesia providers were blinded until completion of the study.\n\nStatistics\n\nSample size and power analysis was based on the fact that ML value of >15% is indicative of fibrinolysis. The investigators hypothesized that a 5% mean difference in ML between the two groups would indicate clinically significant presence of fibrinolysis. The power analysis was set up for t-test for independent samples using a mean difference of 5% (pooled SD 6) and alpha set at 0.05 and 80% power. The analysis yielded a sample size of 24 patients in each group which was increased to 50 to account for withdrawals. A per protocol analysis was performed. Per-protocol analysis was used instead of ITT to ensure accurate evaluation of TXA's effect on fibrinolysis. Since the study focused on the biological response under controlled conditions, including only patients who followed the protocol avoided confounding and preserved scientific validity.\n\nWe performed an interim analysis and concluded that there was no statistical justification to continue the study. In accordance with IRB guidelines, we aimed to use the minimal number of patients necessary, and early termination of the study was justified based on the interim findings and ethical considerations outlined by the IRB.\n\nData were analyzed using the Mann–Whitney U statistic, the student t-test, the Pearson Chi-square test, and one and two-way ANOVA with repeated measures. Statistical significance was p < 0.05. Descriptive statistic was reported in mean and standard deviation. All data were analyzed using SPSS software, Version 28.0.\n\nEthics\n\nThis study was approved by the University's institutional research review board (IRB: #18D.581).\n\nRole of funding source\n\nThomas Jefferson University Hospital, Department of Anesthesiology Program for Translational Research.\n\nResults\n\nParticipant\n\nBetween April 2019 and December 2021, 50 patients were enrolled in the study, and three patients were excluded due to difficulties obtaining blood samples ( Fig. 1 ). The TXA group had 22 patients, and the placebo group had 25 patients. The two groups of patients were similar in age, sex, ethnicity, ASA Physical Status classification, body mass index, and surgical time ( Table 1 ). General anesthesia was administered in seven patients (three in the TXA group and four in the placebo group), and spinal anesthesia was administered in 40 patients (19 in the TXA and 21 in placebo group).\n\nPrimary outcome\n\nMeasured ROTEM variables are shown in Table 2 . At baseline, all measured variables of NATEM (whole blood with no chemical agents) were within the normal range in both groups of patients without any indication of fibrinolysis. However, blood treated with TXA (T-APTEM), compared with NATEM, showed shorter CT and greater ML, suggesting some degree of acceleration of coagulation, most likely by inhibiting naturally occurring fibrin degradation. Intraoperatively (Drug + 45), all NATEM variables were within the normal range in both groups of patients, and no difference was found between the two groups of patients. Variables indicating fibrinolysis (LI30 and ML) were within the normal range without any sign of fibrinolysis in both groups of patients. Postoperatively (End + 60), blood coagulability showed accelerated coagulation with shorter CT and CFT and increased A10, and no patient showed any sign of fibrinolysis. Postoperatively, most T-APTEM variables showed a further acceleration of coagulation compared with the corresponding intraoperative values and NATEM values. No difference was found between the two groups of patients, and fibrinolysis was not shown during this period.\n\nBaseline laboratory values including CBC, platelet counts, PT, aPTT, D-dimer level, and fibrinogen level were within the normal range in all patients and were similar between the two groups of patients ( Table 3 ). Intraoperatively (Drug + 45 min), white blood cell count, red blood cell count, hemoglobin level, hematocrit, platelet count, and fibrinogen level decreased gradually, most likely from hemodilution by crystalloid infusion and bleeding from the surgical site. Intraoperatively, prothrombin time was mildly prolonged, and D-Dimer level increased gradually but did not reach a statistically significant level. No difference was found between the two groups of patients at Drug + 45 except for lower hemoglobin levels in the placebo group patients.\n\nPostoperatively, white blood cell count increased by 30% from the baseline value and by more than 80% from the intraoperative values in both groups of patients. RBC count, hemoglobin level, and hematocrit were similar to those of intraoperative values but lower than baseline values. The platelet count increased from the intraoperative value but was still less than the baseline value in both groups of patients. Prothrombin time, INR, activated partial thromboplastin time, and fibrinogen level returned to baseline values. D-dimer level increased dramatically at this time from 305 ± 258 to 1558 ± 1699 ug/mL in the TXA group and from 408 ± 278 to 5669 ± 2855 ug/mL in the placebo group patients.\n\nTotal hip arthroplasty (THA) involves significant surgical bleeding, with simultaneous activation of coagulation and fibrinolysis. Fibrinolysis is a physiological process that occurs concurrently with clot formation, and D-dimers are natural byproducts of fibrin degradation.\n\nTranexamic acid (TXA) inhibits fibrinolysis decreasing D-dimer levels. However, the degree of physiological fibrinolysis does not necessarily reflect hyperfibrinolytic activity as measured by whole blood viscoelastic testing such as ROTEM. A reduction in D-dimer levels suggests that physiological fibrinolysis has been suppressed. This may carry potential risks, particularly if clot formation occurs in undesired locations and the inhibition of fibrinolysis by TXA prevents appropriate clot resolution.\n\nSecondary outcome\n\nIntraoperatively, both groups of patients received approximately 1400 mL of crystalloid. Estimated intraoperative blood loss by nursing staff, the anesthesiology team, and the surgical team was approximately 250 mL, and was similar between the two groups of patients. No patient received blood transfusion during surgery.\n\nPatients in both groups showed a decrease in hemoglobin, hematocrit, and platelet count 24 h after surgery, reflecting a continuous oozing in the surgical site. Blood transfusion was required postoperatively in two patients (1 unit and 2 units), both in the TXA group. One patient in the placebo group developed arterial bleeding at the surgical site, and it was corrected by embolization. This patient developed a lower extremity DVT four days after surgery. Another patient in the placebo group developed right gangliocapsular stroke within 24 h of surgery and underwent thrombolytic therapy using tissue plasminogen activator. The patient was discharged from the hospital seven days after surgery with mild neurological deficits. The hospital stay was 1.36 ± 0.73 days in the TXA group and 1.52 ± 1.36 days in the placebo group.\n\nDiscussion\n\nTXA is frequently administered prophylactically to reduce blood loss by potentially preventing fibrinolysis during major surgical procedures. Most clinical studies, however, did not investigate the relationship between the presence or degree of fibrinolysis and blood loss. In this study, the presence of fibrinolysis was investigated by viscoelastic testing of two channels of whole blood using ROTEM (NATEM and T-ATEM). For T-APTEM, the dose of TXA used for in vitro prevention of fibrinolysis was five-fold greater than the clinical dose based on the fact that 4–5 times larger dose of epsilon-aminocaproic acid (130 mg%) was needed to inhibit plasminogen activity in vitro . 22 , 23\n\nSome changes in perioperative laboratory variables were observed. White blood cell count decreased somewhat intraoperatively but increased by 80%, which may be associated with inflammatory response to surgical trauma. Platelet count and fibrinogen level decreased in a similar fashion in both groups but were restored to the baseline value after surgery. D-dimer level increased 4- and 14-fold in the TXA and placebo groups, respectively, at the end of surgery and was significantly higher in the placebo group compared to the TXA group. The increase in D-dimer level is most likely associated with activation of coagulation and fibrinolysis that occurs simultaneously and reabsorption of fibrin from the surgical field. A greater increase in its level in the placebo group patients may suggest that the presence of some fibrinolytic activity was inhibited in the TXA group patients.\n\nBlood coagulability is reflected by ROTEM variables. Whole blood without treatment (NATEM) showed normal blood coagulability in both groups of patients at baseline and Drug + 45, suggesting no interval changes. No fibrinolysis was present in all patients. Postoperatively (End + 60), both groups of patients showed similar changes.\n\nROTEM variables of blood treated with TXA (T-APTEM), at baseline, were similar between the two groups of patients, but they showed a tendency of accelerated coagulation compared with NATEM blood samples. This may be associated with inhibition of naturally occurring clinically insignificant fibrinolysis. At Drug + 45, clot formation appeared to be somewhat delayed in both groups of patients. No fibrinolysis was observed in all patients.\n\nPostoperatively, the acceleration of initial clot formation in both groups of patients is associated with activation of coagulation after surgical trauma, and fibrinolysis was not seen in both groups of patients. An increased D-dimer level at End + 60 did not affect ROTEM variables, suggesting that this increase did not influence global blood coagulability.\n\nThis finding is in contrast to published clinical trials, although no existing trials used fibrinolysis as a primary endpoint. Only one study utilized ROTEM for quantitative and qualitative analysis of fibrinolysis in TXA and non-TXA group patients. In this study, however, maximum lysis time, a critical maker of fibrinolysis, was not reported.\n\nSimultaneous activation of coagulation and fibrinolysis is a normal response to disruption of blood vessels to achieve clot formation and to maintain patency of blood vessels. Excessive fibrinolysis or hyperfibrinolysis does not necessarily occur during massive bleeding and disseminated intravascular coagulation as long as the balance between activators and inhibitors of fibrinolysis is maintained. Hyperfibrinolysis develops in pathologic condition, particularly during the anhepatic phase of liver transplantation when plasmin/plasminogen cannot go through hepatic clearance, and a large quantity of TPA is released from the grafted liver into circulation immediately after reperfusion of the grafted liver. 24 , 25 In this condition, administration of an antifibrinolytic agent (either epsilon-aminocaproic acid or TXA) is recommended to treat fibrinolysis when fibrinolysis is witnessed by thromboelastographic monitoring. 26\n\nThis study demonstrated that no patients developed fibrinolysis as measured by ROTEM analysis during and after surgery with and without TXA, and the administration of TXA did not alter coagulation profile or ROTEM variables.\n\nThe two groups of patients were similar in terms of crystalloid infusion, EBL, changes in hemoglobin level and platelets, suggesting that blood loss was similar between the two groups of patients.\n\nThe benefit of TXA has largely been based on published data suggesting that TXA therapy effectively decreases EBL. 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 However, EBL is well known to grossly underestimate true blood loss regardless of its calculation methodology. Multiple studies also reported that EBL is unreliable and inaccurate, since its confounders such as crystalloid infusion volume, comorbidity of patients, difficulties in surgical procedure, and expertise of the surgical team were ignored. 15 , 16 EBL was calculated using the method described by Choi et al. 20 but even this may not be an accurate estimate of total blood loss.\n\nFibrinolysis exists on a spectrum. The commonly used threshold of ML >15% is widely accepted as a marker for identifying hyperfibrinolysis, and this cutoff is not specific to any particular patient population, such as those undergoing cardiothoracic or orthopedic surgery. To be more specific, ML values could be categorized as follows: <5% (no fibrinolysis), 5–10% (mild to moderate fibrinolysis), and >15% (severe fibrinolysis). In this study, all patients exhibited ML values <5%, indicating no fibrinolytic activity.\n\nIn the absence of hyperfibrinolysis, the administration of tranexamic acid (TXA) is not expected to significantly impact maximum lysis (ML) values on viscoelastic testing, as fibrinolytic activity remains within normal physiological limits regardless of TXA use. This observation is consistent with our findings, in which ML values remained stable following TXA administration. However, in settings where ML is elevated, indicating excessive fibrinolysis, TXA has been shown to inhibit plasminogen activation and reduce fibrinolytic activity, resulting in a measurable decrease in ML values. 27\n\nAlthough variations in blood loss have been observed across different pathological conditions in total hip arthroplasty, the primary source of bleeding remains surgical in nature. In contrast, the objective of the present study was to assess fibrinolysis, representing medical (non-surgical) bleeding. Importantly, our results did not reveal significant differences in coagulation profiles, regardless of the underlying pathology. Consequently, a subgroup analysis based on specific pathological subtypes was not warranted.\n\nGiven D-dimer's specificity for cross-linked fibrin degradation, its superior standardization, and broader clinical applicability, it serves as a more reliable marker of active fibrinolysis. Fibrin Degradation Products, due to their lower specificity and limited clinical utility, were not included in this study. Future studies may consider additional fibrinolytic markers, such as plasmin-antiplasmin complexes.\n\nWhile LY30 can indicate fibrinolytic activity, it is important to recognize that values greater than 0% may also result from clot retraction. In such cases, a reduction in the number of fibrin fibers attached to the ROTEM pin can decrease the measured amplitude without representing true fibrinolysis. This mechanical effect mimics lysis but does not reflect complete clot breakdown as seen in fibrinolysis. Therefore, when LY30 shows a value above 0%, other biomarkers, extended observation, and clinical judgment are needed to distinguish between fibrinolysis and clot retraction. True fibrinolysis is typically marked by a progressive decline in amplitude beyond LY30 and the presence of a fibrinolytic tail on the maximum lysis (ML) curve. In the absence of these findings, a reduced LY30 is more likely due to clot contraction rather than actual fibrinolytic activity. LY30 should be interpreted alongside direct markers of fibrinolytic activity, such as plasmin activity, plasmin–antiplasmin complexes, and D-dimer kinetics. Clot contraction is a normal, platelet-driven component of hemostasis involving actomyosin-mediated compaction of the fibrin network, which reduces clot volume, increases density, and occurs independently of plasmin activity.\n\nTXA has been widely used in clinical practice. Current practice tends to focus on estimated blood loss (EBL) and broad outcome studies, which may hinder the adoption of more mechanistic, data-driven approaches. This study was intentionally designed with a strong scientific foundation. While we refrain from criticizing specific prior studies, we raise a serious concern that no study has evaluated fibrinolysis as the primary outcome measure. Relying solely on EBL as an outcome lacks scientific validity and fails to capture the underlying mechanism of action for antifibrinolytics like TXA.\n\nThe prophylactic administration of TXA is not without potential complications. Its use was reported to have a 3.3-fold increased risk of venous thromboembolism and pulmonary embolism in trauma patients, 10 although its causal relationship is not clear with a relatively small sample size. In our study, two patients developed thrombotic complications in the placebo group patients, but none in the TXA group.\n\nSimilar to the current TXA practice, prophylactic aprotinin was used widely for decades to reduce blood loss during cardiac surgery and liver transplantation. However, no study ever demonstrated clear evidence of its effectiveness, and aprotinin was removed from the market after its risk of a 55% increase in myocardial infarction or heart failure and a 181% increase in stroke or encephalopathy was found. 12\n\nA single NATEM costs $7.95 which is significantly less than conventional coagulation tests (PT/INR: $5.39, PTT: $8.24, Fibrinogen: $11.65, D-Dimer: $11.11) that do not reflect blood coagulability and fibrinolysis. The cost of a 10 mL vial of TXA is around $5 ($0.54–$7.47) and total of $1,500,000 across the United States for THA surgeries.\n\nThis study, however, has two limitations. First, the study population may not represent the general population since most patients undergoing THA may be on NSAID or antiplatelet drugs. Second, the sample size was adequate for the primary outcome measure but inadequate to detect rare adverse events with a low prevalence. In this study, the complications observed were descriptively reported, however the sample size is insufficient to conduct a statistical analysis.\n\nWe conducted a sensitivity analysis to gauge the potential effect of 2 missing subjects using dummy variables with imputations for NATEM and APTEM ML measurements for the 45- and 60-min time points. Using ML values of 20% for the additional subjects, we observed a tipping point after an additional 8 subjects, but only in NATEM ML with p = 0.041 at 45 min. 28 No other ML measurements were statistically significant, even after increasing the TXA group to N = 33, a 50% increase in the number of TXA subjects. These results suggest a highly unlikely probability of the occurrence of a type 2 error.\n\nNone of the patients in this study exhibited hyperfibrinolysis. Viscoelastic coagulation testing remains a valuable tool in the perioperative setting for assessing overall coagulation status, including fibrinolysis. While TXA is widely used in clinical practice, current research emphasize estimated blood loss and remote outcome measures such as blood transfusion and mortality. This study was specifically designed to focus on the pathophysiology mechanism of fibrinolysis. While EBL, blood transfusion and mortality can demonstrate correlation, it does not establish an association without laboratory fibrinolysis analysis. Excluding this essential step may restrict the interpretability and scientific rigor of previous findings.\n\nIn this double-blind trial, blood coagulability tested by ROTEM was within the normal range in all patients without any difference between the TXA and placebo group patients. Further, no fibrinolysis was observed in all patients, and the clinical outcomes were similar between the two groups of patients. Viscoelastic coagulation testing such as ROTEM could be used to guide the administration of TXA in selected high-risk patients.\n\nContributors\n\n• UY (Principal investigator): Designing and conducting the study, obtaining funding, data collection, data analysis, and writing the manuscript.
