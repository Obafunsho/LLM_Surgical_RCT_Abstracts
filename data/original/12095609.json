  "title": "Practice Advisory on the Implementation of Preoperative Anemia Management: The Society of Cardiovascular Anesthesiologists and the Society for the Advancement of Patient Blood Management",
  "abstract": "Preoperative anemia is common and associated with worse outcomes in cardiac surgery including acute kidney injury, red blood cell transfusion, cardiovascular complications, stroke, infection, and death. Patient blood management programs, which include dedicated clinical programs to diagnose and treat anemia in advance of surgery (i.e., preoperative anemia programs), have been highlighted as a means to optimize the blood health of each patient, thereby decreasing risk for allogeneic transfusion and improving clinical outcomes. However, there remain implementation challenges for preoperative anemia programs, including difficulties with education of patients and staff, short lead times to address anemia, infrastructure and staffing limitations, lack of clear leadership or ownership of preoperative anemia, the need to develop treatment algorithms and ensure appropriate infusion therapy support, lack of capital support, and insurance/reimbursement concerns, amongst others. The purpose of this advisory from the Society of Cardiovascular Anesthesiologists (SCA) Clinical Practice Improvement Committee and the Subcommittee on Patient Blood Management with endorsement from the Society for the Advancement of Patient Blood Management (SABM) is to provide guidance on the development and implementation of a preoperative anemia clinic or service line, including identification and navigation through potential logistical barriers. A detailed analysis of financial incentives is highlighted in our companion article in this edition focused on the return on investment of anemia management. Although originating with a focus on anemia before cardiac surgery, this advisory is broadly applicable to all perioperative patients.",
