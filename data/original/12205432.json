  "abstract": "Background: Chronic limb-threatening ischaemia (CLTI) places a considerable socioeconomic burden health and social care systems worldwide. The objective of this health economic analysis was to investigate the cost-effectiveness (CEA) and cost-utility (CUA) of a vein bypass (VB) first versus a best endovascular treatment (BET) first revascularization strategy in patients with CLTI who require an infra-popliteal revascularization procedure to restore limb perfusion.\n\nMethods: CEA and CUA analyses were conducted from the perspective of the UK National Health Service. Patient-level resource use and health outcomes data collected from the BASIL-2 trial over 2–7 years of follow-up were utilized to estimate incremental cost-effectiveness ratios expressed as cost per amputation-free life year (AFLY) and cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY). EQ-5D-5L was used to generate participant QALYs at 2 and 3 years.\n\nResults: At two years, the mean(s.d.) discounted hospital cost was £15 742.59(16 182.60) and £13 273.66(15 446.92) in the VB-first and BET-first revascularization strategy groups respectively. The lower costs (–£2524.23, 95% c.i., –£5844.93 to £1131.52) in the BET-first group were mainly due to the reduced number of days in hospital and lower procedural costs. BET-first was also more effective leading to additional AFLYs (0.429, 95% c.i., 0.03 to 0.88) at 7 years and discounted QALYs (0.016, 95% c.i., −0.08 to 0.12) at 2 years.\n\nConclusion: A best endovascular first revascularization strategy dominated a vein bypass first strategy in the cost-effectiveness and cost-utility analyses. The findings were robust across different scenarios and prespecified subgroups.",

  "full_text": "Introduction\n\nChronic limb-threatening ischaemia (CLTI), the most severe manifestation of lower limb atherosclerotic peripheral arterial disease, imposes a significant socioeconomic burden on patients, their families, and health and social care systems in low-, middle-, and high-income countries across the world 1–3 . The costs of caring for CLTI patients are primarily driven by the requirement for often prolonged and repeated hospitalizations, often multiple revascularization procedures, and major lower limb amputation (MLLA) 4–6 . The prevalence of CLTI is increasing worldwide due to ongoing high levels of tobacco smoking, the rapidly increasing prevalence of type 2 maturity-onset diabetes mellitus (DM), and ageing populations. As such, it is widely expected that the costs of caring for CLTI patients will continue to rapidly increase globally 7 .\n\nWithout revascularization, CLTI is associated with a high rate of MLLA and death. The mainstay of the management of CLTI is therefore revascularization to restore limb perfusion. Revascularization procedures for CLTI can be broadly divided into vein bypass (VB) and a range of endovascular interventions that usually comprise angioplasty, with either plain or drug-coated balloons, and the use of stents, which can be bare metal or drug-eluting.\n\nThere are very few health economic studies looking at the relative cost-effectiveness and cost-utility of VB and best endovascular treatment (BET) first revascularization strategies in CLTI patients. The UK National Institute for Health and Care Research (NIHR) Human Tissue Authority (HTA)-funded BASIL-1 RCT, which enrolled participants between 1999 and 2003, suggested that bypass surgery was associated with considerable additional costs but only a small, insignificant, health gain when compared with plain balloon angioplasty (PBA). Bypass surgery was not, therefore, considered a cost-effective strategy in patients requiring infra-inguinal revascularization for CLTI. The majority of participants receiving endovascular therapy in this group received PBA alone with bare metal stenting as a bail out, as more modern adjunctive therapies were not available at this time, the impact of which is unknown 8 . A more recent micro-costing study also found that over a 12-month period VB was more expensive than BET due to longer hospital admissions, higher readmission rates, and increased procedural human resource costs 9 .\n\nThe headline findings of the Bypass versus Angioplasty in Severe Ischaemia of the Leg (BASIL)-2 trial have recently been published 10 . In short, BASIL-2 was a pragmatic open-label, phase 3 RCT comparing vein bypass with best endovascular treatment in patients with CLTI who required an infra-popliteal, with or without an additional more proximal infra-inguinal, revascularization procedure to restore limb perfusion. BASIL-2 was funded by the NIHR HTA and randomized 345 participants to either strategy in equal proportions from July 2014 to November 2020, primarily in the UK but with additional sites in Denmark and Sweden. The primary outcome was amputation-free survival, and all patients had at least 2 years of follow up. A VB-first revascularization strategy was associated with a 35.0% increased relative risk of major amputation or death when compared to a BET-first strategy (adjusted hazard ratio 1.35 (95% c.i. 1.02 to 1.80); P = 0.037) 10 . This was mainly due to the greater number of deaths in the VB-first group as limb salvage rates (prevention of MLLA) were similar in both groups. This health economic analysis uses patient-level data collected in the BASIL-2 RCT to investigate the cost-effectiveness and cost-utility of VB-first versus a BET-first revascularization strategy in this CLTI patient cohort.\n\nMethods\n\nTrial design and participants\n\nThe BASIL-2 RCT design, methods, and clinical results have been published previously 10 . Briefly, BASIL-2 was an open-label, pragmatic, multicentre, phase 3 superiority RCT carried out in 41 vascular surgery units in the UK ( n = 39), Sweden ( n = 1), and Denmark ( n = 1). Between 22 July 2014 and 30 November 2020, 345 participants were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to either a VB-first or a BET-first revascularization strategy. All participants were followed up 1 month after the first revascularization procedure; 6 and 12 months after randomization; and then annually until the last recruited participant had been followed up for a minimum of 24 months. The trial was approved by the National Research Ethics Service (14/WM/0057) and registered with the ISRCTN registry, ISRCTN27728689.\n\nEconomic evaluation overview\n\nThe within-trial BASIL-2 economic evaluation comprised cost-effectiveness (CEA) and cost utility (CUA) analyses conducted from a UK National Health Service (NHS) perspective. Outcomes were expressed as cost per amputation-free life year (AFLY) and per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) respectively. Resource use, amputation-free survival (AFS), and health related quality of life (HRQoL) were collected using case report forms (CRFs) for those participants who were willing and able over the 2- to 7-year follow-up period. National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) recommendations 11 were followed and data analysis was carried out using Stata (version 17.0) 12 . Findings are reported following the Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards guidelines 13 . All costs are shown in 2022 British pounds (GB£), with costs and benefits being discounted at 3.5% in accordance with HM Treasury recommendations and NICE current guidance, to calculate the present value of annual costs incurred one year from randomization 11 , 14 .\n\nResource use and costs\n\nData on resource use were collected using CRFs completed by participants and/or research nurses. These included: hospital-based services (including procedure-related resource use for the primary interventions; non-bypass revascularization defined as ‘thrombolysis, thrombectomy and endarterectomy, fasciotomy or other revision of anastomosis’; and MLLA), index admissions and readmissions (as bed days), day case admissions, out-patient appointments and diagnostic imaging; primary and community healthcare contacts (general practitioner, practice nurse, and other primary healthcare contacts); out-of-pocket expenses incurred by participants; and time off work. Additionally, the total number of high-value endovascular devices used by individual participants who received endovascular intervention was reported and multiplied by the device unit cost. Data regarding each segment treated in the arterial tree were gathered, including device use for each specific segment, not just those used in the target infra-popliteal vessel.\n\nResources unit costs were obtained from standard sources 15 , 16 . The procedural human resource costs associated with the VB-first and BET-first revascularization strategies, and with MLLA, were derived from a previous micro-costing study 9 . A detailed description of how resources were valued and the assumptions that were used to generate the cost of healthcare services (verified by clinical experts) is provided in Supplementary Material S1 .\n\nSelf-reported data on days off work were multiplied by the average gender-specific wage rate from the Annual Survey of Hours and Earnings 17 based on the human capital approach 18 , and were employed to generate productivity costs.\n\nAll unit costs are presented in Table S1 . The NHS cost inflation index was used to inflate all costs reported before 2022 16 . As the perspective of the study was the UK NHS, UK national unit cost values were applied to resource-use data from the Swedish and Danish sites. A micro-costing approach was used to estimate the total costs for different cost categories by multiplying the resource item by the unit cost and summing over all items.\n\nHealth outcomes\n\nIn this supplementary analysis, the primary outcome measure for the CEA was AFLYs, defined as the time in years to major (above the ankle) amputation of the trial leg or death from any cause (whichever occurred first). For the CUA, as recommended by NICE 11 , HRQoL was measured using the EQ-5D-5L questionnaire, a generic instrument measuring and valuing HRQoL, to generate QALYs over a period of 2 and 3 years. The EQ-5D-5L scores at different time points and QALY differences between treatment arms were adjusted for baseline EQ-5D-5L score as well as age group, gender, diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease and severity of clinical disease in line with minimization variables in the original BASIL-2 protocol. Information on the collection of EQ-5D-5L data and conversion to utility scores is provided in the Supplementary Material S2 . The ICEpop CAPability measure for Older people (ICECAP-O) 19 was used to describe changes in capability over the trial period and the details are also provided in Supplementary Material S2 .\n\nStatistical analysis\n\nThe base case analysis was conducted using the intention-to-treat population. This was chosen, as opposed to only those participants who were adherent to protect the power of randomization and reduce potential bias. Multiple imputation technique by chained equation 20 and predictive mean matching was used to impute missing data regarding costs 21 and EQ-5D-5L scores 22 , assuming that values were missing at random, by generating 50 imputed data sets. Estimates obtained from the imputation model were combined using Rubin’s rule. 23 Resource use, cost, and outcome data were summarized and reported as mean values and standard deviations. Hospital services data were also reported as median and interquartile range.\n\nFor costs and QALYs, group means and between-group adjusted differences with 95% confidence intervals were generated using bias-corrected and accelerated bootstrap resampling methods with 1000 replicates 24 , 25 . These differences were adjusted for age group (≤60, 61–70, 71–80, >80 years), gender, DM, and chronic kidney disease, severity of clinical disease (rest pain only, tissue loss only, both), and previous (permissible) intervention to the trial leg. EQ-5D-5L baseline score was also considered in the adjustment for health outcome measures 26 .\n\nEconomic analysis\n\nThe base-case CEA and CUA analyses compared the two revascularization strategies using the imputed data set. The hospital services costs, including the initial revascularization and additional procedures, and related hospital stays, to the end of follow-up were considered in the base-case analysis, as these were expected to be the main drivers of cost 3 , 8 , 27 . Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were calculated as cost per AFLY gained for the CEA and cost per QALY gained for the CUA. These ICERs represented the ratio of the incremental costs of a BET-first revascularization strategy relative to the associated incremental outcome compared to a VB-first strategy. Uncertainty was assessed using bootstrapping techniques to derive 5000 paired estimates of mean incremental costs and outcomes 28 . The bootstrapped estimates were then graphically presented on cost-effectiveness planes 28 , 29 . The estimates were also used to construct a cost-effectiveness acceptability curve showing the probability that BET-first revascularization strategy is cost-effective at different willingness to pay (WTP) values 30 . Based on NICE recommendations an ICER of £20 000–£30 000 or less per QALY gained was considered cost-effective 11 . We also explored a range of alternative assumptions in the sensitivity analysis (details in Supplementary Material S3 ).\n\nResults\n\nPatient population\n\nSome 345 CLTI participants (median age 72.5 years, 81.2% men) were randomized to either a VB-first ( n = 172) or BET-first ( n = 173) revascularization strategy. Three hundred and ten (89.9%) participants received their allocated revascularization, and 18 (5.2%) received an alternative revascularization. Three hundred and nine participants received a revascularization within 4 weeks of randomization. Seventeen (4.9%) participants did not receive a revascularization. During the trial period, 108/172 (62.8%) participants in the VB-first group and 92/173 (53.2%) participants in the BET-first group had an MLLA or died (no AFS). At 2 years after randomization, 66 participants in the VB-first and 66 participants in the BET-first group completed hospital resource use and EQ-5D-5L data at all time points.\n\nResource use\n\nFollowing randomization, during the index admission, participants in the BET-first group spent relatively fewer days in hospital (general wards, high-dependency unit, and intensive therapy unit) than those in the VB-first group ( Table 1 ). However, when the total length of stay (LoS), including the initial index hospitalization and readmissions, was estimated, the average total LoS was similar in both groups. This suggests that patients in the BET-first group required more in-patient care after the initial hospitalization.\n\nDetails on the use of endovascular devices are provided in Table S2 . More patients in the BET-first group (168 patients) utilized endovascular devices than those in the VB-first group (52 patients). For those in the BET-first group, the average number of different types of endovascular devices consumed was fairly similar with slightly more drug coated balloon (DCB) use. For the few patients in the VB-first group who crossed over to BET-first, bare metal stenting (BMS) was mainly used followed by DCB, and no patients received drug eluting stents (DES).\n\nPrimary and other secondary healthcare services\n\nThe level of primary and other secondary healthcare service utilization was fairly similar in both groups ( Table S3 ). However, patients in the BET-first group visited out-patient clinics, district nurses, and other healthcare professionals (chiropodist, podiatrist, and diabetic and vascular nurses) more often than those in the VB-first group.\n\nTotal aggregated costs\n\nMean total per-patient costs are shown in Table 2 . Randomization to a BET-first revascularization strategy was associated with lower total NHS (hospital and other health service) costs (£2069.33, 95% c.i., –£5524.43 to £1417.67) in the 2 years after randomization. Total costs were mainly driven by hospitalizations (almost 70% in both groups) and procedural human resources costs (16.7% and 11.5% in both the VB-first and BET-first groups respectively). When the societal perspective was also considered, differences between the groups slightly increased with a BET-first strategy being associated with a £2414.40 (95% c.i., –£5867.91 to £1270.63) reduction in total costs.\n\nOutcome\n\nEQ-5D-5L and ICECAP-O\n\nAt baseline, participants in the VB-first group had a worse mean EQ-5D-5L score than those in the BET-first group, albeit this difference was small and of questionable clinical significance (index difference 0.06, 95% c.i., 0.001 to 0.134; Table S4 ). At 2 years, participants in the BET-first group had a slightly better EQ-5D-5L score than those in the VB-first group (additional adjusted 0.064 score, 95% c.i., −0.03 to 0.14).\n\nTo evaluate the impact of replacing EQ-5D-5L scores for death, the mean scores without replacement are reported separately in Table S5 . The results of the ICECAP-O values for the two groups at different time points, adjusted and unadjusted for death, are presented in Tables S6 , S7 respectively. There were some small differences in capabilities between the two groups throughout the follow-up period; however, both groups demonstrated significant decline from baseline at 36 months in the capability index.\n\nFinal health outcomes\n\nFor the primary outcome, a BET-first revascularization strategy was relatively more effective, in terms of discounted years of AFS, than a VB-first strategy (2.937 years versus 2.575 years respectively) and was associated with 0.429 (95% c.i., 0.03 to 0.88) additional AFLY. Regarding HRQoL, patients in the BET-first group had an average of 0.884 QALYs, reflecting an additional 0.016 QALYs (95% c.i., −0.08 to 0.12) compared to those in the VB-first group (mean 0.832 QALY). The mean per-participant outcomes for the imputed and complete-case analyses at 2, 3 and 7 years (discounted and undiscounted) are presented in Table S8 .\n\nEconomic evaluation\n\nA summary of the findings from the base-case analyses (discounted and undiscounted) is shown in Table S9 . In the CEA, in health economics terms, a BET-first strategy was dominant over a VB-first strategy with a reduced discounted hospital related cost of £1690.34 (95% c.i., –£5689.09 to £1975.93), and an additional 0.429 (95% c.i., 0.03 to 0.88) AFLY compared to a VB-first strategy. The CUA analysis revealed that, at 2 years, a BET-first strategy was also dominant over a VB-first strategy, as it was associated with £2524.23 (95% c.i., –£5844.93 to £1131.52) less discounted cost and slightly more QALYs (mean 0.016, 95% c.i., −0.08 to 0.12) than VB-first. Three years post-randomization, the BET arm showed £2233.25 (95% c.i., –£5830.15 to £1396.49) lower costs and an additional 0.085 (95% c.i., −0.09 to 0.22) QALYs compared to VB-first.\n\nSensitivity analysis\n\nThe cost-effectiveness planes ( Fig. 1 ) show that the majority of the joint incremental costs and effectiveness estimates demonstrate that a BET-first revascularization strategy is less costly and more effective than a VB-first strategy in terms of cost per AFLY and cost per QALY at 2 and 3 years. The probability of a BET-first strategy being cost-effective compared to a VB-first strategy was 98% if an arbitrary WTP value per AFLY of £15 000 was used ( Fig. 2 ). On the basis of the NICE current WTP threshold of £20 000 per QALY gained, the probability that a BET-first strategy is a cost-effective option was 91% and 94% within the first 2 and 3 years of follow-up respectively.\n\nScenario analysis\n\nA BET-first revascularization strategy also remained dominant (less costly with more QALYs) when alternative scenarios were explored including the complete case analysis. Results of the sensitivity analysis are presented in Table S10 , and more detailed results in the Fig. S1 and Table S11 . In most of the prespecified subgroups studied, a BET-first strategy was less costly than a VB-first strategy although QALY differences ranged from positive to negative ( Fig. 3 ).\n\nDiscussion\n\nWhen compared to a VB-first revascularization strategy, a BET-first strategy was associated with reduced costs and improved outcomes at the end of the trial period. The cost difference was primarily due to a reduction in hospital LoS and lower procedural costs. A BET-first strategy is therefore considered a cost-effective revascularization strategy in this CLTI patient group.\n\nThe findings were generally consistent over key sensitivity analyses, when other healthcare costs were considered, or when adopting a broader societal perspective, when including adherent patients, and when another method to calculate the cost of hospital stay was considered. A BET-first strategy was also cost-effective across different prespecified subgroups.\n\nIn the BASIL-1 trial, a bypass-first revascularization strategy was also associated with significantly higher hospital costs compared to PBA, also mainly as a result of increased hospital stay and procedural costs 8 . The current analysis showed similar results related to increased hospital costs over the trial period. However, in BASIL-1, patients in the bypass-first group had non-significantly improved HRQoL compared to those in the PBA-first group 8 . The CUA results in BASIL-1 demonstrated that a bypass-first strategy was not a cost-effective intervention compared to PBA given the substantially higher costs and relatively small and insignificant QALY gain 8 .\n\nIn a previous micro-costing study, VB was also found to be more expensive than BET over a 12-month period due to increased hospital LoS and procedural costs; the latter mainly due to more time and staff required to perform VB 9 .\n\nThe LoS for patients undergoing bypass surgery was prolonged at a median of 12.5 days. This is likely due to multiple reasons; first, patients in BASIL-2 were elderly and co-morbid, often with complex mobility and social issues which may have delayed discharge; second, the reported LoS here represents the entire index admission, not just the number of days from intervention; and last, to be eligible for BASIL-2 clinicians had to have equipoise between the two strategies to randomize, reaching a position of equipoise and treatment uncertainty may also have contributed to the relatively long LoS.\n\nIn terms of resource use, participants randomized to BET had a small increase in access to outpatient appointments in primary and secondary care. The reasons for this are unclear; however, the use of further imaging modalities was similar, therefore it is unlikely that deterioration of CLTI or recurrence was the cause. Complete data capture for outpatient resource use was not complete so these results must be interpreted with caution.\n\nVery few economic evaluation studies have estimated the cost-effectiveness of different CLTI revascularization strategies. Such studies are extremely challenging due to the complexity of the reporting of the interventions and the patient journeys, which often involve repeated readmissions and complex procedures 31 . This is the first RCT-based economic analysis since BASIL-1 8 . The BASIL-2 RCT allowed patient-level data on resource use and clinical effectiveness to be collected over a 7-year time horizon. Cost utility could only be estimated for 3 years due to a lack of data beyond this time point. Recommended and robust statistical approaches of data imputation and analyses were employed in analysing these data. However, we accept that the results of imputed data must be interpreted with caution and a level of uncertainty, particularly for longer-term outcome data which were more challenging to collate.\n\nCompared to the BASIL-2 trial, patients in the previously mentioned costing study underwent a higher proportion of vein bypasses using the common femoral artery or profunda femoris artery as a proximal anastomotic site. In BASIL-2, only 25.5% of the vein bypasses were performed from these sites, which may suggest that these were shorter in length than in the previous study. This may suggest that vein bypasses in the previous costing study took longer and therefore were more expensive than those in BASIL-2, which might have led to an overestimation of cost.\n\nThe limitations of the micro-costing exercise are discussed at length in the published manuscript, but in short: the exercise took place at a single institution in the UK which was one of the lead centres for BASIL-2, only one popliteal-pedal bypass was included, data collection was over a 12-month period, and individual devices and instruments were not collated due to the complexities of healthcare purchasing in the UK. The results of this study, therefore, must be interpreted with this in mind. The assumptions taken from this work are the best currently available. In this analysis, we chose to focus specifically on the direct impact of CLTI on the participant. However, we accept that patients with CLTI are often multi-morbid and have other conditions which may increase healthcare costs. The burden of this was outside the scope of this work.\n\nData regarding the costs of interventions for infra-popliteal intervention are sparse. The magnitude of this difference, if any, is unknown. The level of missing data, due to the nature of the patient population being studied, and contributed to by the COVID-19 pandemic, is a limitation. Information regarding the initial index admission was incomplete for a number of participants. At the 7-year follow-up time point up to 60% of the data were imputed. However, a comparison of imputed and complete-case analyses led to similar conclusions. Although, inevitably, a number of assumptions (described above) had to be made while conducting the analyses, these are likely to impact both groups equally.\n\nThe cost of endovascular devices including BMS, DCB, and DES was considered in the total hospital costs; however, information on other consumables such as introducers, guides, plain balloons, and percutaneous closure systems were not collected, along with associated costs. Similarly, further information regarding adjunctive devices used in the bypass surgery group was also not collected at a granular level. This was largely due to a lack of resources, difficulty in gaining individual costs for items, and the burden of data collection on local sites.\n\nA decision model was initially planned to estimate the long-term cost-effectiveness of both strategies. However, due to the long length of follow-up, this was deemed unnecessary.\n\nThe BASIL-2 health economic analysis was based primarily from centres and participants in the UK. A small proportion of participants were recruited in Denmark and Sweden. Although there are similarities between these countries and the UK NHS there are also likely to be differences that may have influenced the findings of this study. In terms of generalizability, BASIL-2 is likely to be an accurate representation of UK CLTI patients with infra-popliteal disease, where clinicians have equipoise between the two treatment strategies. It is difficult to know if patients outside of this remit or those in other healthcare systems and in other countries would have similar results for either the primary outcome or this health economic analysis. There are, however, likely to be similarities.\n\nThis BASIL-2 within-trial health economic analysis provides unique RCT-based evidence regarding the relative costs and effects of a VB-first versus a BET-first revascularization strategy in this CLTI patient group over a follow-up period of 2–7 years. However, further research is required to explore and mitigate the uncertainty around some of the findings. Better approaches to obtaining detailed hospital stay data, particularly the initial (index) hospitalization is required in future studies. Additionally, the severity of CLTI and the improvement in patients’ condition with revascularization may not have been fully captured by the EQ-5D-5L measure. A mapping approach where treatment effects measured on disease-specific scales are translated into treatment effects on generic HRQoL scales could be used as an alternative approach to inform resource allocation decisions across a range of interventions for different conditions and populations 32 .\n\nOn the basis of the health economic findings using data from the BASIL-2 RCT, a BET-first revascularization strategy is likely to be recommended by decision-makers for CLTI patients who require an infra-popliteal, with or without an additional more proximal infra-inguinal, revascularization procedure to restore limb perfusion. In such CLTI patients, where clinical equipoise existed between the two strategies being compared, a BET-first revascularization strategy was less costly and more effective than, and therefore dominated, a VB-first strategy. These results were generally stable over key sensitivity analyses and consistent across patient subgroups.\n\nCollaborators\n\nIan Chetter, Athanasios Diamantopoulos, Arul Ganeshan, Simon Hobbs, Kim Houlind, Hugh Jarrett, Jonas Malmstedt, Jai V Patel, Tawqeer Rashid, Athanasios Saratzis, Julian A Scott, Hany Zayed, Jonathan J Deeks, Peter Gillgren, Duncan Ettles, Martin Claridge, Ray Ashleigh, Rebecca Wallace, Christopher Twine, Toby Richards, Lim Chung, Thomas Rix, Robert Davies, Will Adair, Wesley Stuart, Patrick Chong, Chris Imray, William Neary, Alun Davies, Robert Hinchliffe, Peter Holt, Gerard Stansby, Raman Uberoi, Jeremy Perkins, Lasantha Wijesinghe, Nityanand Arya, Stephen Goode, Jonathan Beard, Trevor Cleveland, Rajiv Vohra, Radu Rogoveanu, Rachel Sam, Sohail Choksy, Manjit Gohel, Thomas Joseph, Woolagasen Pillay, Isaac Nyamekye, Damian Kelleher, Georgios Antoniou, Mario Caruana, Murray Flett, Harvey Chant, Rachel Barnes, Kevin Mercer, Marco Baroni, Nandita Pal, Tahir Hussain, Mike Yapanis, Sandip Sarkar.",
