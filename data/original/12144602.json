  "title": "Uptake of orally administered tranexamic acid in women during active labor: A pilot intervention study on prophylactic treatment of postpartum hemorrhage",
  "abstract": "Introduction: Postpartum hemorrhage is the leading cause of maternal mortality worldwide. Several studies have confirmed that tranexamic acid is effective in treating postpartum hemorrhage once started, but its prophylactic effect is under debate. As of now, most studies involve intravenous administration, and the uptake of tranexamic acid in women during active labor is unknown. This is a pilot study in preparation for a larger randomized controlled trial on the prophylactic effect of oral tranexamic acid on postpartum hemorrhage. The study aims to assess the uptake of oral tranexamic acid during active labor.\n\nMaterial and Methods: Our study is a pilot intervention study. The study population consisted of 51 women ≥36 gestational weeks with planned vaginal delivery at Södersjukhuset, Stockholm, from December 2022 through February 2023. The participants were randomized 1:1:1:1 to receive 2 g of tranexamic acid as an oral solution, tablets, effervescent tablets, or 1 g of intravenous tranexamic acid, near full cervical dilatation. Blood samples were taken before and 30, 60, 120, 240, 360, and 480 min after tranexamic acid administration. Plasma concentration of tranexamic acid was measured using liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry. Mean values were compared between groups using analysis of variance. Our main outcome measures were time to therapeutic level, duration in therapeutic interval, and maximum plasma concentration of tranexamic acid.\n\nResults: Therapeutic level (5.0 mg/L) was reached at the 2‐h time point for oral (7.11 ± 3.31 mg/L) and the 30‐min time point for intravenous forms (30.6 ± 15.0 mg/L). Duration in therapeutic intervals for oral and intravenous forms was 6 and 3.5 h ( p < 0.007). Peak plasma concentrations for oral and intravenous forms were 10.2 ± 3.9 mg/L and 30.6 ± 15.0 mg/L, respectively ( p < 0.001). Time‐to‐therapeutic level ( p = 0.08), duration in therapeutic interval ( p = 0.92), or peak concentration ( p = 0.73) did not differ between oral forms. Overall, 37 women (88%) found the intake of oral tranexamic acid during active labor acceptable.\n\nConclusions: All oral forms of tranexamic acid show similar and adequate uptake when administered during labor. Uptake is lower and slower compared with intravenous administration, but the duration in the therapeutic interval is longer.",

  "full_text": "INTRODUCTION\n\nEach day nearly 800 women lose their lives to pregnancy‐related complications. Postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) is the leading cause of maternal death. 1 Tranexamic acid (TA) is an anti‐fibrinolytic agent that blocks plasminogen from binding to fibrin and in doing so, inhibits the breakdown of blood clots, theoretically decreasing hemorrhage regardless of its cause. 2 TA is well established in the treatment of heavy bleeding in trauma. 3 During the last decade, studies have shown reduced maternal mortality with administration of intravenous (IV) TA within 3 h after onset of PPH, 4 , 5 , 6 and using IV TA as a first line of treatment for PPH is recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO). 7 , 8\n\nThe prophylactic effect of oral TA on PPH after vaginal deliveries is, however, insufficiently known, and uptake during active labor has, to our knowledge, not been studied. 9 The uterus and placenta are highly vascularized organs during pregnancy, and once bleeding starts, it may be difficult to control. 10 Limiting bleeding before it reaches the threshold of PPH or severe PPH is therefore critical. A serum concentration of ≥5 mg/L is regarded as a therapeutic level, and a concentration ≥10 mg/L provides near‐maximal inhibition of fibrinolysis. 11 , 12 To prevent PPH, a therapeutic serum concentration of TA should coincide with the period immediately after delivery when the risk of PPH is greatest.\n\nMost research on obstetric use of TA has focused on IV administration. 4 , 5 , 13 , 14 , 15 In the low‐income settings most severely affected by PPH, IV treatment may not be an option due to price and accessibility. Therefore, the WHO has called for more studies on alternative routes for administration of TA. 7 Oral TA, which is often available as over‐the‐counter medication, is of low cost and easy to administer, making it applicable to all types of delivery settings, including low‐resource settings and homebirths.\n\nIn preparation for a larger randomized controlled trial on the prophylactic effect of oral TA on PPH after vaginal delivery, we performed a pilot study aimed at evaluating uptake, feasibility, and acceptability of the administration of oral and IV forms of TA during active labor.\n\nMATERIAL AND METHODS\n\nBetween December 2022 and February 2023, we performed a randomized controlled, open‐label, single‐center pilot study comparing the uptake of TA between three oral forms of TA and IV TA.\n\nPatient and public contribution\n\nPrior to study start, 40 female colleagues of the authors, who had experienced active labor and vaginal birth, were asked if they would prefer to take a tablet, an effervescent tablet, or an oral solution as medication during labor. No form stood out as more or less acceptable than the others, which supported the inclusion of all oral forms of TA in the study. No other patient or public contribution was added to the study.\n\nStudy population\n\nWomen above 18 years of age planned for vaginal delivery at the Department of Obstetrics at Södersjukhuset, Stockholm, Sweden were invited to participate. We aimed to select a group of women without pregnancy disorders that might affect the pharmacokinetics of TA and who were not at increased risk of receiving additional TA postpartum, which would have affected our measurements. Therefore, we excluded women with renal disease, cardiovascular disease (apart from gestational hypertension), preeclampsia, intrauterine growth restriction, diabetes mellitus type I, threatening preterm labor before gestational week 36 + 0, known bleeding disorder, anemia (Hb <100 g/L), and stillbirth. We excluded women with known hypersensitivity toward TA and inability to understand the contents of the written information about the study. We also excluded women with ongoing treatment or prevention for venous thromboembolism or a history of seizures, as both these conditions can be very rare side effects of TA.\n\nWomen who delivered by cesarean section after intake of TA were not excluded if the study product was administered during active labor, as stipulated by the study protocol.\n\nWomen were recruited during an antenatal visit after 35 gestational weeks or at the delivery ward before active labor after giving private written informed consent.\n\nOutcomes\n\nOur primary outcomes were time‐to‐therapeutic plasma concentration, duration in therapeutic interval, and maximum plasma concentration of TA. Time‐to‐therapeutic plasma concentration was the time from administration until the measurement time point at which a plasma concentration ≥5 mg/L was achieved. Duration in therapeutic interval was defined as the time between the measurement timepoint at which therapeutic concentration was first achieved and the measurement timepoint at which it was last achieved.\n\nSecondary outcomes were feasibility, defined as the rate of women randomized to the study who received TA as planned; acceptability for women, defined as the rate of women who reported intake of TA as easy or relatively easy; and acceptability for providers, defined as the rate of providers who reported that administering TA was easy or relatively easy. Subsidiary outcomes were reported side effects and any thromboembolic event up to 6 weeks postpartum. TA has not been shown to increase the incidence of thromboembolism after birth, 5 , 14 , 16 , 17 but since the highest risk of thrombosis occurs directly postpartum and the pharmacodynamics of TA are consistent with an increased risk, we chose to include this as a secondary outcome to assess the risk–benefit of administering TA prophylactically to a low‐risk population.\n\nStudy procedures\n\nParticipants were randomized to one of four groups who, at full cervical dilation, received either 2 g of TA as an oral solution (20 mL à 100 mg/mL), tablets (four tablets of 500 mg each), effervescent tablets (two tablets à 1 g dissolved in water), or 1 g of intravenous (IV) TA (10 mL of TA 100 mg/mL in 100 mL 9 mg/mL saline solution administered over at least 10 min).\n\nWe used 1 g of IV TA as a comparison in the study because the high bioavailability of TA after IV administration is well‐established and 1 g is the current recommended dose for treatment of PPH. 5 , 8 A previous randomized controlled trial on non‐pregnant volunteers suggests that the bioavailability of oral TA may be as low as 46%, why we assessed a dose of 2 g to be an adequate oral dose of TA. 18 , 19 Since uptake after oral administration was expected to be slower, we administered TA at full cervical dilatation, a time point when we estimated around 2 h remained until delivery and occurrence of PPH.\n\nThe randomization sequence was computer‐generated 1:1:1:1 in blocks of varying sizes by a researcher not involved in the study. Due to an expected high rate of discontinuation, the randomization sequence allowed for the enrollment of 64 women to enable the analysis of 40 participants.\n\nRandomization took place once the woman was admitted to the labor ward and in active labor. A separate venous peripheral line for study‐related blood sampling was secured.\n\nVenous blood samples were drawn in 4.0 mL K2 Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) vacutainers before intake, and 30, 60, 120, 240, 360, and 480 min after intake of TA for measurement of plasma concentration. Blood samples were centrifuged immediately or refrigerated for a maximum of 12 h before centrifugation at 1800 G at 4°C for 10 min to separate the plasma. One mL of plasma was pipetted into 2 mL tubes and frozen at −20°C. After recruitment was complete, all plasma samples were transported frozen in bulk to the research laboratory at the Swedish Veterinary Agency (SVA), Uppsala, Sweden. The quantitative analysis of TA was performed using ultra‐high‐performance liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC–MS/MS) (Supporting Information Appendix S1 ).\n\nTime points for TA administration and blood sampling were noted, as were any adverse events or side effects related to the medication or difficulties in administering or taking the drug. Background and pregnancy‐related data were extracted from patient records. We screened medical records for cases of thromboembolism up to 6 weeks postpartum. All study data were recorded pseudonymized in an electronic Case Report File using the data collection system REDCap.\n\nStatistical analyses\n\nWe assumed that the therapeutic effect would exist at or above 5 mg/L and that a maximum plasma concentration would be attained 2 h after administration. We assessed that even with a relatively high variance (±5 mg/L) we would be able to see an adequate concentration curve with 10 people in each arm, in accordance with previous studies. 18 , 20 We thus aimed for an analyzed sample of 40 women and continued recruitment until this was achieved.\n\nBackground data were compared between groups and presented as numbers and absolute rates. Distribution was checked for normality using the Shapiro–Wilk test. Normally, distributed data were compared using two‐sided independent samples T ‐test for two groups and one‐way analysis of variance (ANOVA) test for multiple groups and presented as means ± standard deviation. Non‐normally distributed data were compared with independent samples medians test and presented with medians with 95% CI. Chi‐square tests were used for comparing proportions. P ‐values <0.05 were considered significant.\n\nWe compared plasma concentration at each measurement time point to evaluate time to therapeutic plasma concentration, duration in the therapeutic interval, and maximum plasma concentration between all oral groups using ANOVA, as well as between all oral forms combined and the IV group using a two‐sided independent samples T ‐test. As required by ANOVA, missing data for plasma concentration measurements at specific measurement time points were imputed with the mean value for plasma concentration in the respective group at that time point.\n\nIn a sensitivity analysis, we analyzed time to therapeutic level and duration in therapeutic interval using another model of imputation for missing data. If the venous sampling time point differed from the stipulated measurement time point by more than 30 min, we adjusted data points to the times the measurement was recorded. Plasma concentrations at the stipulated time points were imputed from the line plotted between actual measurements. This was only done for values that occurred between two known values on a rising or falling slope. Peak values were not imputed. If the plasma concentration of TA was above 5 mg/L in a participant's last venous sample and plasma levels were decreasing, subsequent ½‐hourly plasma concentrations were projected based on the decrease between our last two verifiable measurements. This gave us a complete but conservative estimate of duration in therapeutic interval for most participants, as the rate of decline of plasma concentration levels usually decreases over time.\n\nThe analysis of our main outcomes included all participants who had at least three plasma concentration samples taken. Participants who received extra TA during or immediately after delivery or who did not have any uptake due to vomiting immediately after administration were excluded.\n\nFeasibility, acceptability for women, and acceptability for providers were analyzed for all participants eligible for TA according to the study protocol.\n\nWe performed a sub‐analysis where participants who received the oral forms of TA were divided into groups according to how soon after intake of TA they gave birth. Mean plasma concentrations at each time point were compared between women who delivered within 1 h, 1–3 h, or more than 3 h after administration of TA.\n\nStatistical analyses were performed using IBM SPSS Statistics, Version 29.0.1.0.\n\nRESULTS\n\nTrial population\n\nA total of 250 women were asked to participate, of which 55 were enrolled after written informed consent. Four participants gave birth before randomization could occur. Fifty‐one women were randomized to oral solution ( n = 12), effervescent tablets ( n = 13), tablets ( n = 13), or IV solution ( n = 13) of which nine were discontinued due to various reasons. Forty‐two women received TA according to protocol, and all had at least three blood samples for plasma concentration TA taken. Six participants were excluded from the final analysis. Data from the remaining 36 participants receiving TA as oral solution ( n = 10), tablets ( n = 9), effervescent tablets ( n = 8), and IV ( n = 9) were included in our main analysis of plasma concentration. Inclusion to the study in detail is shown in Figure 1 .\n\nForty‐five women took part in our analysis of feasibility and acceptability. One woman did not receive TA due to precipitous delivery, one could not swallow tablets, and one did not receive TA for unknown reasons.\n\nBackground and delivery data\n\nThe mean age of all participants was 33.5 years, mean gestational age at delivery was 39 weeks and 6 days, and median BMI at the start of pregnancy was 24.2. Of all participants, 43.1% were primiparous, 5.9% had had a previous cesarean section, 7.8% had a history of PPH, and 74.5% had induced labor. Mean duration of active labor was 7.4 h, and mean blood loss after delivery was 495 mL. Over 500 mL of IV fluids were administered to 17.6% of participants, and no participant received a blood transfusion. No neonate had arterial pH in the umbilical cord <7.05 at birth or 5‐min Apgar <7. Women in the TA tablet group and IV group had higher BMI compared with the other groups (Table 1 ).\n\nPrimary outcomes\n\nWhen analyzed together, time‐to‐therapeutic level was seen at the 120‐min measuring point for oral forms of TA and the 30‐min measuring point for IV TA. The average duration in the therapeutic interval was 6 h for oral and 3.5 h for IV TA. Peak plasma concentration was 10.2 ± 3.9 mg/L, seen at the 240‐min measurement time point for oral, and 30.6 ± 15.0 mg/L, seen at the 30‐min measurement time point for IV TA (Table 2 ).\n\nAll oral forms of TA administered during active labor showed uptake. There was no significant difference in mean concentration at any measurement time point between the different forms of oral administration, except at 120 min when there was a marginal difference between oral solution and other forms ( p = 0.04). (Table 2 , Figure 2 ).\n\nPlasma concentrations of TA after IV and oral administration were significantly different at all measurement time points. Intravenous administration resulted in higher concentrations at measurement time points up to 120 min after administration, whereas oral administration resulted in higher concentrations at 240, 360, and 480 min after administration (Table 2 , Figure 3 ).\n\nIn our sensitivity analysis, we found similar results to our main analysis. The mean time‐to‐therapeutic level was 2.0 ± 0.9 h for oral forms of TA and 0.6 ± 0.2 hours for IV administration ( p < 0.001). The duration in the therapeutic interval for oral forms of TA was 6.6 ± 1.8 hours and 3.4 ± 1.0 for IV administration ( p < 0.001) (Table 2 ). Of all plasma concentration data ( n = 252), 13 measurements were missing, and at no measurement time point were more than three plasma concentration measurements missing.\n\nSubgroup analyses\n\nOf the participants who received oral TA, 20/27 (74%) gave birth within 3 h after the intake of medication. Plasma concentrations were not different for any measurement time point between the groups that gave birth within an hour of receiving TA, between one and 3 h of receiving TA, or more than 3 h after receiving TA (Figure 4 ).\n\nSecondary outcomes\n\nThe feasibility of TA administration in any form in the study group was 42/45 (93%). The acceptability for women of intake of TA in any form was 37/42 (88%). Of the 42 participants who received TA in any form from the midwife, five (12%) found it “somewhat difficult” or “difficult” to receive/ intake the medication (oral solution group n = 2 effervescent group n = 2, IV group n = 1). For two participants, this was due to the proximity of birth and severe labor pain with a simultaneous need for laughing gas; for one, it was due to fear of needles, and for one, it was due to nausea. The acceptability of administration of TA in any form among midwives was 36/42 (86%). In six cases (14%), the midwife reported administration of TA as “somewhat difficult” (IV group n = 3, oral solution group n = 1, effervescent group n = 1, tablet group n = 1). Five midwives related this difficulty to the woman being just about to give birth and/or in severe labor pain, and one to the fact of it being very busy at the labor ward at the time. All other participants and midwives considered it easy to receive and administer TA in all forms.\n\nFive participants (12%) reported possible side effects after the intake of TA (all received oral forms), two experienced nausea, and three reported vomiting, all of whom had also vomited during labor before the intake of TA. No woman suffered from a thromboembolic event up to 6 weeks postpartum.\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nAccording to our findings, all oral forms of TA show active and similar uptake during labor. Compared with 1 g of iv TA, the uptake of 2 g of oral TA is significantly slower and lower; however, the duration in the therapeutic interval is almost twice as long for oral forms. Our study also shows a high feasibility and acceptability of taking oral TA during labor.\n\nOur study is, to the best of our knowledge, the first to evaluate the uptake of oral TA in women during active labor. 20 , 21 It contributes to an increased understanding of the pharmacokinetics of oral TA in pregnant women, which will help decide when to administer oral TA for optimal effect or design future studies on the prophylactic effect of TA. The study is performed in a clinical setting, with interventions performed by the midwife in charge of the patient to assess the feasibility and acceptance of interventions, enabling future study designs with high effectiveness grades.\n\nWe included only women who had one dose of TA and were able to retain it, as we believed this contributed most to the current gap in knowledge, that is, the degree of uptake of a single dose of oral TA during active labor with retained intake. To evaluate the effectiveness of TA on PPH after vaginal delivery in future studies, all women should be included.\n\nWomen were often recruited to the study once they were admitted to the labor ward. This led to an overrepresentation of inductions of labor, as these women were in a frame of mind where they could take part in a written informed consent. Induction is performed in Sweden for an increasing number of reasons, and we have no reason to believe that this selected group differed in any significant way with regard to their physiology from our target population. Fewer plasma concentration curves than expected could be analyzed, and we did not quite reach our predetermined study size of 40 analyzed participants.\n\nDuration in the therapeutic interval of oral forms of TA was longer than expected, 6 h when measuring the mean plasma concentration of TA at set time points. This was confirmed by our sensitivity analyses with imputed data. Nevertheless, 7/27 women in the oral group reached therapeutic levels between the 120‐ and 240‐min measurement time points, indicating therapeutic levels remaining more than 8 h after the intake of TA. In hindsight, we should have continued measurements for another 2–4 h to determine a more accurate duration in the therapeutic interval. Similarly, several women likely reached peak serum concentration between measurement time points, meaning our average peak concentration was likely lower than the actual value. Including more measurement time points would have addressed these limitations but would have incurred additional discomfort for our study participants.\n\nOur results show similar but somewhat lower uptake than in the study by Grassin‐Delyle et al. from 2022, where 15 healthy non‐pregnant volunteers were given the same oral dose; peak serum concentration was 12.8 (95% CI 9.5–16.0) and was reached 3 h after administration, according to a fitted pharmacokinetic model based on population pharmacokinetics. 19\n\nTo the best of our knowledge, no other studies have assessed uptake during active labor, but a few have studied uptake in pregnant women before labor and directly postpartum. Muhunthan et al. showed that the mean time to a maximum plasma concentration of 10 mg/L in women receiving 2 g of oral immediate‐release TA 1 h postpartum was 2.9 h and therapeutic plasma concentration (5 mg/L) was reached after 1 h. 20\n\nIn the Woman‐PharmacoTXA trial by Shakur‐Still et al., where 120 pregnant women prior to planned cesarean delivery were randomized to receive either 1 g of TA IV, 1 g of TA as an intramuscular injection, 4 g of orally administered TA, or no TA at all, it was shown that maximum blood concentrations after oral administration were 18.1 ± 7.4 mg/L and were reached 3.8 ± 2.6 h after intake of TA. 21 These data are similar to ours and support adequate uptake of oral TA in pregnant women, also indicating that higher doses are acceptable and do not jeopardize safety.\n\nA post‐hoc pharmacokinetic study of the blood samples taken in the Exadeli study showed an increase in Plasmin–Antiplasmin complexes and D‐dimer in patients with PPH and that this effect was reduced in women treated with TA, confirming an effect on hemostasis. 22\n\nSeveral studies on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of IV TA in pregnant women before labor have been published in recent years, to evaluate an optimal dose of IV TA for treatment of PPH. Ahmadzia et al. proposed 600 mg TA IV to be an optimal dose, 13 Li et al. suggested 650 mg TA IV 23 while the TRACES trial, where 175 women with ongoing PPH were randomized to TA 0.5 g IV, TA 1 g IV, or placebo, concluded that fibrinolytic activity was significantly inhibited by 1 g but not 0.5 g of TA IV. 24 Assuming a bioavailability of ~ 50%, this further supports that effective oral doses of TXA should be at least 2 g. 18 , 19 In concordance with previous studies, we have assumed a plasma concentration of 5 mg/mL to be within therapeutic range and partially inhibit fibrinolysis, although aware of the fact that these conclusions are based mainly on in vitro studies and rarely on pregnant women. In one of the reviewed studies, Leichen et al. showed that significantly higher TA doses were needed to inhibit fibrinolysis in blood from pregnant women than from controls. TA concentrations of 14.73 μg/mL (95% CI 12.35–17.55 μg/mL) or 11.19 μg/mL (95% CI 8.31–15.07 μg/mL) for pregnant women and 11.19 μg/mL (95% CI 8.31–15.07 μg/mL) and 6.82 mg/mL (95% CI 5.30–8.77 μg/mL) for controls were needed depending on clotting method. 25 The need for higher doses in pregnant women could be due to their more procoagulant state, which may change in case of bleeding. One may speculate that the plasma concentration of TA needed is different when used as prophylaxis instead of treatment of PPH. This must be considered when planning future studies, and we recommend comparison of different doses of TA in in vivo studies.\n\nThe prophylactic effect of IV TA on PPH is debated as initial studies have shown positive effects 26 but subsequent larger randomized trials have not been able to verify this in either vaginal or cesarean delivery. 14 , 15 , 27 Oral TA compared with IV is of low cost, easy to store, quickly administered, and can be self‐administered. It is clear that IV administration achieves a more rapid effect and should be used for treatment of PPH if it is available. However, given its longer duration in the therapeutic interval, oral TA may play an important role in the prophylaxis of PPH in vaginal delivery when the timing of birth and subsequent risk of PPH cannot be exactly predicted.\n\nFuture research in this area to further establish the pharmacokinetics of oral TA in pregnant women would be of great value and using the same plasma measurement method would be of importance for comparison.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nAll oral forms of TA show a similar and adequate uptake when administered during labor. Uptake is lower and slower compared to IV administration, but the duration in the therapeutic interval is nearly twice as long. Our results further indicate that administering oral TA during active labor is both feasible and acceptable to women and providers. Whether oral TA can prevent PPH requires further research.\n\nAUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS\n\nGita Strindfors: led the study procedures, study administration, data collection, and curation, wrote the first version of the manuscript.
