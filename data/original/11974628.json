  "full_text": "METHODS\n\nTrial Design\n\nThe CSP-TBI study was a phase 2, single-center, open-label, randomized trial comparing feasibility, safety, and outcomes in patients with TBI requiring platelet transfusion. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either CSP or RT platelet transfusion after radiographic confirmation of TBI and determination of the need for platelet transfusion by treating clinicians. A total of 315 patients who arrived at a single level 1 trauma center (UPMC Presbyterian) were screened and assessed for eligibility. The intervention arm received a single apheresis unit of urgent release CSPs which was transfused as soon as feasible, while concomitant postinjury care was occurring. Up to 2 units of CSPs could be transfused based on clinical laboratory testing and/or clinical need. This decision was made by the clinical team and not directed by the study protocol. The standard care arm received a single unit of RT platelets transfused as soon as feasible, while concomitant postinjury care was occurring. Further, RT platelet transfusion could occur based on laboratory and/or clinical needs. We enrolled and randomized 100 patients from March 17, 2022, through October 18, 2023. We did not alter any other aspects of care. The trial protocol can be found as a Supplemental Data File (Supplemental Digital Content 1, http://links.lww.com/SLA/F387 ).\n\nThe U.S. FDA (Investigational New Drug 025180), the Office of Human Research Oversight of the U.S. Department of Defense, and the Human Research Protection Office at the University of Pittsburgh approved the clinical trial. An external data and safety monitoring board oversaw the trial. The Institutional Review Board at the University of Pittsburgh approved an exception from informed consent (EFIC) to enroll participants for those patients without the capacity to consent and with no available legally authorized representative (LAR). This approval included community consultation and public disclosure/notification.\n\nCapacity of the patient to provide informed consent was assessed before randomization by Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score. Patients were assessed in the emergency department, and options for prospective consent were first evaluated. Potential subjects with a GCS <15 were considered unable to consent and were enrolled under EFIC procedures. Potential subjects with a GCS of 15 were further assessed with a Galveston Orientation and Amnesia Test (GOAT) 28 , 29 to determine whether approaching prospective consent was appropriate. In the case where the patient was determined to be unable to consent, attempts to identify a LAR were undertaken. When a patient was considered unable to consent, and no LAR was available, they were enrolled under EFIC procedures. Patients enrolled under the auspices of EFIC, and/or their LAR, were notified of enrollment as soon as feasible and were approached for consent for continued participation. 30 The study followed the “Consolidated Standard of Reporting Trials” reporting guideline.\n\nStudy Patient Population\n\nPatients were eligible for enrollment if they suffered TBI, defined by the presence of potential progressive intracranial injury through computerized tomography (CT) imaging who had a need for platelet transfusion determined by the clinical team and institutional practice. The need for platelet transfusion included either a history of antiplatelet agent medication use or clinically significant thrombocytopenia or both clinical indications. The need for platelet administration and the number of units transfused was a clinical team treatment decision. Antiplatelet agents screened for included aspirin and/or P2Y 12 agonists (clopidogrel, ticagrelor, or prasugrel) as well as dual antiplatelet medication use. Exclusion criteria included extremes of age, penetrating injury, hypotension (systolic blood pressure < 90 mm Hg), known prisoner or pregnancy, non-neurosurgical operative intervention in the first 60 minutes of arrival, therapeutic anticoagulation including warfarin or direct-acting oral anticoagulants, platelet transfusion contraindication including recent vascular stent or stroke and wearing a “NoCold Stored Platelet” opt-out bracelet.\n\nRandomization and Masking\n\nIndividual patients who meet all inclusion and no exclusion criteria were randomized and assigned according to a 1:1 ratio of CSP infusion to RT platelet transfusion using a permuted block design with variable block sizes of 4 and 6. The arm assignment was provided in real-time at the patient level using an electronic randomization system. Backup envelopes containing randomization assignments were available if there were any issues or failures of the electronic randomization system. Treating physicians were not masked to treatment assignment. Arm assignment was concealed to outcome assessors and those performing 6-month follow-ups. Platelet transfusion occurred as soon as feasible. To facilitate the administration of platelets in a timely manner, randomization of eligible patients was to occur within a maximum of 2 hours from the radiologic diagnosis of brain injury.\n\nIntervention and Comparison Arms\n\nAfter meeting all inclusion and no exclusion criteria, patients randomized to the CSP arm received a single apheresis CSP unit prepared following the FDA approved guidelines as soon as feasible. 27 CSP units were refrigerated within 4 hours of donation and were stored in a monitored refrigerator at 1 to 6 °C for up to 14 days from the date of donation. The CSP unit was stored in an emergency department refrigerator and was transfused as soon as feasible postrandomization. A second unit of CSP could be transfused based on clinical factors.\n\nAfter meeting all inclusion and no exclusion criteria, patients randomized to the RT platelet arm received a single apheresis unit of RT platelets following standard platelet transfusion practice. RT platelets were stored and released from the blood bank following standard blood banking procedures. A second unit of RT platelets could be transfused based on clinical need.\n\nOther than the randomly assigned platelet transfusion, no other aspects of clinical care were altered following enrollment.\n\nOutcomes\n\nThe primary outcome for the phase 2 trial was feasibility, including: the proportion of eligible patients able to be randomized, the proportion of patients enrolled, the proportion of patients with adherence to the protocol and the proportion of patients completing the 6-month outcome assessment.\n\nOur prespecified principal clinical outcome for assessing safety and efficacy for the trial was the 6-month Glasgow Outcome Scale–extended (GOS-E) score, performed by a trained neuropsychological technician. 31 – 33 Additional secondary outcomes included 24-hour and in-hospital mortality, need for craniectomy/craniotomy, need for intracranial pressure (ICP) monitoring, CT radiographic brain injury progression, GOAT score at hospital discharge, the incidence of allergic/transfusion reaction and transfusion-related acute lung injury, and the incidence of thromboembolic events.\n\nRadiographic brain injury was characterized by a single board-certified neuroradiologist blinded to the randomization assignment. Brain injury progression was characterized by a board-certified neuroradiologist blinded to the randomization assignment. TBI progression was defined by an increase in Rotterdam CT scan score 34 – 37 by at least 1 point and/or by radiologist assessment, on serial CT imaging over 24 hours.\n\nPrespecified subgroup analyses for the 6-month GOS-E outcome included (1) patients who did or did not require a craniectomy/craniotomy,(2) patients who did or did not require ICP monitoring, (3) patients who arrived from the scene of injury versus from a referring hospital, (4) patients with a pre-injury history of aspirin use as compared with clopidogrel/other antiplatelet agents, and (5) those who received CSPs with an age since the donation of ≤7 days as compared with 8 to 14 days.\n\nStatistical Analyses\n\nThe feasibility of enrollment was evaluated by determining the proportion of patients in each feasibility category. These proportions were estimated directly as the observed ratio of numbers of patients, with 95% CIs being calculated.\n\nThe principal intent-to-treat safety and efficacy analysis compared 6-month GOS-E across the CSP and RT platelet arms. A 2-sided χ 2 test was used to compare the distribution of the GOS-E across the treatment arms. An ordinal polytomous regression model was then used to assess the independent impact of CSP on GOS-E after controlling for baseline GCS. For binary secondary outcome comparisons, logistic regression was used to assess the independent impact of CSP on outcomes while adjusting for baseline GCS. Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to assess the independent impact of CSP on time to death after controlling for baseline GCS. For continuous outcome comparisons, an analysis of covariance model was used to assess the independent effect of CSP after controlling for baseline GCS.\n\nAnalyses to test for the homogeneity of the treatment effect were carried out for the 4 prespecified randomized subgroups. Regression models appropriate for the outcome variable were stratified by the predefined subgroups and estimates of the treatment effect and 95% CI were determined.\n\nFor the prespecified CSP age ≤7 days versus 8 to 14 days old analyses, outcomes were compared across each platelet age subgroup in those patients who received CSPs. Since the CSP age was not randomly assigned, a propensity score was generated as an indicator of the age of the CSP product (≤7 vs 8 to 14 days), and multivariable regression models were used to assess the independent relationship of age of the CSP product on 6-month GOS-E. Other secondary outcomes were similarly compared.\n\nThe study was formally powered for the primary feasibility outcome. Using this planned population size for enrollment, we determined the effect size we would be able to detect with 80% power for the principal clinical outcome. For the principle 6-month GOS-E clinical outcome, based on a 2×8 (treatment x GOS-E), there is 80% power to detect an effect size of 0.38, assuming a type I error rate of 0.05, a 2-sided alternative hypothesis, 7 degrees of freedom, and a sample size of 50 participants per treatment group.\n\nRESULTS\n\nA total of 315 patients were assessed for trial eligibility, of which 203 met all inclusion and no exclusion criteria, with 100 patients being randomized and constituting the intent-to-treat cohort. Prospective consent was obtained in 47 patients before randomization with the remaining being enrolled utilizing EFIC. There were 103 patients who met all inclusion criteria but were unable to be randomized due to either staff/product unavailability, enrollment time window restrictions, or other logistical reasons (Fig. 1 ). Of the 100 patients in the intent-to-treat cohort, 50 were randomized to the CSP arm, and 50 were randomized to the standard care RT platelet arm. There was one enrolled patient in the RT platelet arm who refused consent for continued participation in subsequent outcome comparisons soon after enrollment. All outcome events before refusal of consent for continued participation were included in the analyses. The 6-month GOS-E outcome was available for 43 patients (86%) in the CSP arm and 40 patients (80%) in the RT platelet arm, with the remainder being lost to follow-up. We estimated a 24-month enrollment period and completed the study after reaching our target enrollment after 19 months.\n\nEnrolled patients had an average age of 74 ± 10 years, were 54% males, had a median overall injury severity score of 14 [interquartile range (IQR): 9 to 22], and a median head/neck abbreviated injury score of 3 (IQR: 3 to 4). Patients were taking aspirin 75.0% of the time, a P2Y 12 inhibitor 6.0% of the time, or both in 17.0% of patients. There were 2.0% of patients enrolled requiring platelet transfusion without a history of antiplatelet agent use. Patients had an all-cause 24-hour and in-hospital mortality of 1.0% and 13.1%, respectively. Patients required ICP monitoring 5.0% of the time while neurosurgeons performed operative interventions (craniotomy/craniectomy) in 11.0% of enrolled patients.\n\nThe assigned treatment regimen was provided to the enrolled patient 95% of the time. For the CSP randomized arm, 48/50 patients (96.0%) received the CSP transfusion. The 2 patients who did not receive CSP transfusion, due to product storage limitations, did receive RT platelet transfusion. In the standard care RT platelet arm, 47/50 of patients (94.0%) received RT platelet transfusion with the remaining 3 patients not receiving platelet transfusion secondary to logistical difficulties.\n\nThe CSP and RT platelet arms were similar in demographics, injury characteristics, and TBI severity (Table 1 ). The baseline GCS scores were similar across the randomized arms. The Rotterdam score on the initial head CT used for TBI diagnosis was similar across the randomized groups. Whether patients were taking aspirin, a P2Y 12 antagonist, or both were similar across the treatment groups. The number of units of platelets transfused was similar across the arms.\n\nFor the primary feasibility outcome, the proportion of eligible patients who could be randomized was (203/315) 64.4%, (95% CI: 59.1 to 69.7), with (100/203) 49.3%, (95% CI: 42.4% to 56.1%) being randomized and enrolled. The proportion of patients with adherence to the study protocol was (95/100) 95%, (95% CI: 90.7% to 99.3%) and the proportion of patients where the principle clinical outcome of 6-month GOSE was known/available was (83/99) 83.8%, (95% CI: 76.6% to 91.1%).\n\nWhen the time to platelet transfusion was compared across the randomized arms, patients randomized to CSP received their platelet transfusion significantly earlier than those in the RT arm from the time of randomization [median time (IQR): 29 (18, 61) vs 130 (72, 218) minutes, P < 0.01).\n\nPatients randomized to CSPs compared with the RT platelet arm did not significantly differ across 6-month GOS-E scores after adjusting for baseline GCS scores [odds ratio (OR): 1.58, 95% CI: 0.71, 3.54, P = 0.27; Table 2 ]. When the GOS-E scores were dichotomized into favorable (5 to 8) and unfavorable (1 to 4) outcomes, no significant differences were found across randomized treatment groups (OR: 1.28, 95% CI: 0.52, 3.18, P = 0.59). The 6-month GOS-E outcome in the 4 prespecified randomized subgroups is depicted in Figure 2 . No heterogeneity of treatment effect across any of the randomized subgroups was found.\n\nNo group differences were found in GOAT scores at discharge (difference: 4.0%, 95% CI: -10.6% to 16.6%; P = 0.77), 24-hour mortality (difference: 2.0%, 95% CI: -1.9% to 5.9%; P = 0.32), or in-hospital mortality (difference: -2.3%, 95% CI: -15.6% to 11.0%; P = 0.74; Table 2 ). No significant differences were found in the incidence of TBI progression (difference: -6.7%, 95% CI: -22.8% to 9.4%; P = 0.41), the need for ICP monitoring (difference: -2.1%, 95% CI: -10.7% to 6.5%; P = 0.63), or the incidence of thromboembolic events (difference: 2.0%, 95% CI: -1.9% to 5.9%, P = 0.86). There were no transfusion reactions or cases of transfusion-related acute lung injury reported in either arm. There was a significantly lower rate of craniotomy/craniectomy in the CSP arm (difference: -14.4%, 95% CI: -26.5% to -2.3%, P = 0.03, Fig. 3 ) compared with the RT platelet group. This remained significant after adjusting for both baseline GCS and time to platelet transfusion (OR: 0.18, 95% CI: 0.03 to 0.95, P = 0.04).\n\nThe number of adverse events, serious adverse events, and serious adverse events with any relatedness were similar across CSP and RT platelet comparison arms (Table 3 ).\n\nThere was no association between the 6-month GOS-E and the storage age of the CSP product transfused after accounting for confounders through propensity score adjustment (OR: 1.27, 95% CI: 0.37 to 4.3, P = 0.69; Table 4 ). When other secondary outcomes were compared across the CSP storage age groups, no significant differences were found.\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nThe morbidity and mortality attributable to TBI represents a growing public health problem and spares no age group or demographic. 3 – 5 Early resuscitative interventions in those with hemorrhagic shock have been shown to improve outcomes in those with TBI. 38 – 40 Outcome improvements for those with isolated TBI, particularly those on anticoagulation and antiplatelet agent treatments, remain elusive. 6 , 9 The results of the current phase 2 randomized trial demonstrate the feasibility, safety, and potential efficacy of CSPs relative to RT platelets in those brain-injured patients requiring platelet transfusion. Despite similar baseline brain injury grading scores, patients who received CSPs had a statistically lower rate of neurosurgical operative procedures. This outcome difference remained significant after controlling for disparities in the timing of platelet transfusion across the groups. These findings highlight the need for definitive phase 3 trials which are required to determine safety and efficacy outcomes for CSP transfusion in patients with TBI.\n\nTransfusion of CSPs, in this specific TBI population, may provide a more hemostatic advantage relative to RT platelets. 20 , 21 , 24 – 26 , 41 , 42 Cold storage of platelet products also has the potential to promote transfusion earlier due to the urgent release capabilities of the product. 23 With the FDA only recently approving CSP transfusion, 27 randomized trial evidence verifying their feasibility and future trials characterizing their safety and potential efficacy is of paramount importance.\n\nThe feasibility and safety of CSP transfusion out to a storage age of 14 days has recently been demonstrated in patients with severe injury at risk of hemorrhagic shock. 23 The cold storage of platelets has the significant potential to expand the platelet supply by increasing the shelf-life beyond current limitations attributable to RT storage. In the current trial, no clinical outcome differences were found across CSPs with a storage age of 1 to 7 days relative to 8 to 14 days, providing phase 2 randomized evidence for the feasibility of CSPs in clinical practice postinjury. Future phase 3 trials are required to determine the safety and efficacy of CSPs in patients with TBI.\n\nStrengths and Limitations\n\nThe current trial has strengths including being well randomized at the level of the patient. The adverse event monitoring and recording were robust and demonstrated the safety of the transfusion product. Although the current results focus on patients with TBI requiring platelet transfusion, these results may be applicable to other types of bleeding diatheses.\n\nThe platelet transfusion product represents a precious resource and minimization of wastage was a priority during the execution of the trial. Over the enrollment period of the trial, 109 units of CSPs were stocked and available for eligible patients randomized to cold storage with 62 units being transfused in enrolled patients.\n\nLimitations of the trial include its phase 2 design and small sample size, limiting power for clinical outcomes, and the potential for type II error. The intervention could not be blinded resulting in potential bias. Platelet transfusion was directed by the clinical team. Although no significant differences across the arms, up to 2 units of platelets, could have been transfused, possibly resulting in confounding. Reliance on medication exposure history may confound the current results. The study was a single-center trial, and the results may not be applicable to other trauma centers with different attributes and capabilities. Enrolled patients had a low injury severity, and the results may not be reproducible in more severely injured patients with TBI. Differences in injury severity could result in confounding across patients enrolled through prospective consent and exceptions from informed consent. Missing data limits the ability to draw definitive conclusions from the GOS-E outcome. Both the storage temperature of the platelet product and the timing of platelet transfusion were different across the randomized groups, and the trial was unable to differentiate the cause for any outcome effects.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nCSP administration to TBI patients on antiplatelet medication was feasible but did not result in improvement in the 6-month GOS-E scores relative to RT platelet transfusion. CSP transfusion demonstrated a lower rate of neurosurgical operative intervention, without evidence of a higher rate of thromboembolism or adverse events. There were no clinical outcome differences based on the age of the platelet product out to 14 days following donation. Appropriately powered phase 3 clinical trials are needed for definitive comparison to determine the safety and efficacy of CSPs in patients with TBI. The transfusion of CSPs in TBI patients requiring platelet transfusion is feasible and has the potential to expand the available platelet supply.",
