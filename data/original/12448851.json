  "title": "Covered versus uncovered endoluminal stenting in the acute management of obstructing colorectal cancer in the palliative setting: randomized clinical trial (CReST2)",
  "abstract": "Background: Around 15% of people with colon cancer present with an obstruction. Stenting is appropriate for patients unfit for surgery and/or those with advanced cancer. Patients are living longer with advanced colon cancer; stent design (covered versus uncovered) may influence stent re-intervention and quality of life (QoL).\n\nMethods: CReST2 is a phase III multicentre RCT. Patients were randomized 1 : 1 to receive either a covered or uncovered stent. Patients and all medical personnel except the person placing the stent were blinded to allocation. Treatment allocation was via a central randomization service, minimized for: age (≤70 years, >70 years), WHO performance status, tumour site, and indication for palliation. Co-primary endpoints were stent patency up to 6 months after randomization and QoL at 3 months (30 days for patients who died before 3 months) from randomization measured using the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) QLQ-C30 global health score. Secondary endpoints were stenting success rate, rates of short-term (30 days), intermediate-term (1–3 months), and long-term (3–6 months) stent-related complications, stent-related complication rates of patients undergoing chemotherapy within 6 months after randomization, cumulative frequency of stoma formation, survival at 6 months, and overall survival.\n\nResults: A total of 377 patients were randomised across 28 sites, in whom stenting was unsuccessful in 47 (12.5%) patients (27 of 188: 14.4% covered and 20 of 186: 10.7% uncovered stents). Stent patency at 6 months in stented patients was 117 of 161 (72.7%, covered) and 136 of 166 (81.9%, uncovered) (adjusted HR 1.48, 97.5% confidence interval (c.i.): 0.86–2.54). In this stented population, 216 patients (66.1%) contributed to QoL assessment at 3 months with mean(s.d.) QLQ-C30 global health scores of 54.1(23.9) and 51.6(25.4) in the covered and uncovered groups respectively (adjusted mean difference 1.63, 97.5% c.i. –5.85–9.11). The total numbers of patients experiencing at least one complication in the first 6 months after randomization were 42 of 161 (26.1%) for covered stents and 29 of 166 (17.5%) for uncovered stents. Stent migration was the most common complication and was higher in the covered group. In the covered group and the uncovered group, 44 of 161 (27.3%) and 40 of 166 (24.1%) patients respectively received chemotherapy up to 6 months after randomization. There was a low risk of late perforation associated with both types of stent.\n\nConclusion: There appears to be greater prolonged stent patency and less stent failure with uncovered stents. QoL is unaffected by stent design.\n\nRegistration number: ISRCTN54834267.",

  "full_text": "Introduction\n\nDespite efforts to increase the rates of early diagnosis, each year around 15% of people with colorectal cancer present with obstruction 1 . In many patients with colorectal cancer, their age, their general health, and the advanced state of their cancer means that they may not withstand emergency surgery. Stenting provides an immediate relief of symptoms, whilst avoiding the need for a stoma.\n\nIn the palliative situation, several studies have demonstrated the short-term benefits of stenting compared with emergency surgery 2–5 , although the number of patients in randomized studies is small. These benefits include a reduced 30-day mortality, shorter hospitalization, reduced ICU admission rates, and a shorter time to initiation of chemotherapy. Improvements in chemotherapy and biological therapies have resulted in colorectal cancer patients living longer with a stent in situ . Stent-related complications have been reported in over a third of patients and include bowel perforation, stent occlusion, and migration 6–9 , raising concerns that severe complications limit the long-term success of stents 10 .\n\nTwo designs of stent are in common use. In the UK, the majority of stents placed are made of bare metal (uncovered stents), the remainder have a plastic covering designed to reduce the risk of the tumour growing into the lumen and causing re-obstruction (covered stents). Non-randomized studies and two small randomized trials 8 , 11 have reported that stent design may affect complication rates and re-intervention rates. A systematic review 12 reported that uncovered stents were associated with a lower late migration rate than covered stents, a higher tumour ingrowth rate, and prolonged stent patency. Studies have included patients treated as a bridge to surgery and patients with metastatic disease from other cancer primaries. No studies have been blinded. As such, the quality of evidence is limited.\n\nCReST2 was designed to determine which stent design, covered or uncovered, is the more efficacious (in terms of stent patency and complications) and better in improving the quality of life (QoL) in patients with bowel obstruction arising from colorectal cancer in the palliative setting.\n\nMethods\n\nStudy design and participants\n\nThis RCT (ISRCTN54834267) took place in 28 acute National Health Service (NHS) hospitals in the UK. Eligible participants were aged >16 years, presenting with left-sided colonic obstruction considered to be due to incurable colonic malignancy. Patients with signs of peritonitis and/or perforation, incipient caecal perforation, or obstruction in the mid or lower rectum, patients being treated with or considered for treatment with antiangiogenic drugs (for example bevacizumab), and pregnant patients were excluded. The patient pathway is shown in supplementary material S1 .\n\nParticipants were assigned in a 1 : 1 ratio to insertion of either a covered stent or an uncovered stent. Randomization was performed by telephone or by a secure online randomization system at the Birmingham Clinical Trials Unit (BCTU) (available at https://www.trials.bham.ac.uk/CReST2 ). After consent and before stent insertion, all participants completed the baseline QoL questionnaire. A minimization algorithm was used to ensure balance in the treatment allocation over the following variables: age (≤70 years, >70 years), WHO performance status (0, 1, 2, 3, 4), tumour site (ascending colon, hepatic flexure, transverse colon, splenic flexure, descending colon, sigmoid, rectosigmoid, proximal rectum), and indication for palliation (unresectable local disease, unresectable metastatic disease, unfit for surgery).\n\nThe trial was double-blinded. Only the trials unit and the clinical specialist responsible for stent insertion were aware of the randomized allocation. The patient, the clinician responsible for follow-up, and all other site personnel remained blinded to the type of stent placed. Unblinding was permissible if required due to an urgent clinical need or patient safety issue. All participants provided written informed consent to participate. For the duration of the study, interim analyses of data on both efficacy and safety were reviewed, in strict confidence, by an independent Data Monitoring and Ethics Committee.\n\nProcedures\n\nParticipating centres must have placed ≥30 stents for the treatment of obstructing colorectal cancer, with participating individual surgeons, radiologists, or endoscopists having placed ≥10. Centres that had placed <30 stents were eligible to participate in CReST2 after review of their stenting data by the CReST2 clinical leads. A standard stent insertion technique was agreed, which included a pre-procedure enema, a combined endoscopic/fluoroscopic technique, involving the endoscopic insertion of a self-expanding metal stent (SEMS) and no pre- or post-dilatation, and a post-procedure plain X-ray 13 .\n\nA team comprising designated lead surgeons, radiologists, and gastroenterologists was formed in each centre to establish a clear management pathway. Patients were classified before randomization as having disease suitable for palliative treatment. After resuscitation, patients allocated to stenting had a SEMS deployed across the tumour. Stenting was considered palliative and no further surgery was mandated.\n\nAll patients in CReST2 were allocated to receive one of two different types of stent—uncovered or covered. Stents with any covering were classed as covered stents. The stents used in CReST2 were all existing, commercially available, marketed products, which were licensed and CE marked. Participating trusts could select the stent of their choice from a range of suitable stents approved for use within the trial by the CReST2 Trial Management Group. This allowed practitioners inserting stents to use the stent type with which they were most familiar.\n\nOutcomes\n\nThe first 12 months of recruitment formed an internal feasibility study. The aim of the internal feasibility study was to assess the rate of recruitment at 12 months after the start of recruitment and to assess clinician equipoise, thus enabling the feasibility of the study to be determined. The full phase III part of CReST2 had two co-primary outcomes: QoL at 3 months (30 days for patients who died before 3 months) from randomization measured using the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) QLQ-C30 global health score and stent patency up to 6 months after randomization. Secondary outcomes were stenting success rate in each group (defined as clinical relief of bowel obstruction), rates of short-, intermediate-, and long-term stent-related complications in each group (30 days, 1–3 months, and 3–6 months after stent insertion respectively), stent-related complication rates of patients on chemotherapy in each group up to 6 months after randomization, cumulative frequency of stoma formation in each group, survival at 6 months in each group, and overall survival in each group; QoL at 3 months was also measured using the EORTC QLQ-CR29 disease-specific module for colorectal cancer. Stent-related complications included, but were not limited to, bowel perforation, stent migration, and re-obstruction. Stent follow-up forms collected data on stent-related complications, stoma presence, and re-interventions. Any serious adverse events (SAEs) that occurred were recorded over the course of the entire follow-up interval.\n\nTo investigate the representativeness of the randomized population, centres were asked to record a limited amount of anonymized data on patients with left-sided bowel obstruction presumed secondary to carcinoma who were potentially eligible for the trial, but who were not part of the trial.\n\nStatistical analysis\n\nThe sample size for CReST2 was based on two co-primary outcomes: QLQ-C30 global health score 14 at 3 months and stent patency at 6 months. For QoL, a 0.5 s.d. difference between groups would be clinically meaningful 15 . For stent patency, the expected patency rate in the control arm was 30% and an improvement to 50% in the patients receiving a covered stent would be clinically meaningful. To detect a difference of 0.5 s.d. in QoL and an improvement in stent patency from 30% to 50% between groups using the standard methods (comparing means and comparing proportions with continuity correction respectively) with 90% power and a type I error rate of 2.5% to account for the multiple comparisons, a total of 157 participants per group would need to be randomized, 314 in total. Assuming and adjusting for a 10% loss to follow-up/dropout rate, target recruitment was 350 participants. The co-primary analyses were undertaken on a modified intention-to-treat (ITT) basis, meaning that the co-primary analyses were restricted to those participants who had a successful first stent insertion procedure after randomization, irrespective of treatment compliance. The covariates used for adjustment for this outcome were the minimization variables—age, WHO performance status, tumour site, and indication for palliation. QoL at 3 months was measured using the QLQ-C30 global health score using the official scoring manual 16 . Using data obtained at the 3-month time point (or 30-day time point if 3-month data were not available), the adjusted mean difference and 97.5% confidence interval was estimated using a linear regression model and a P value was calculated. The covariates used for adjustment for this outcome were the baseline global health score, plus the minimization variables.\n\nStent failure occurred when the stent was no longer providing luminal patency. The time to stent failure up to 6 months after randomization was compared between groups using an adjusted Cox proportional hazards model and is displayed in a Kaplan–Meier plot. The adjusted HR and 97.5% confidence interval was estimated and a P value was calculated. Statistical significance of the treatment group parameter was determined from the P value generated by the model.\n\nTwo sensitivity analyses were performed to test the robustness of the co-primary QoL analysis: including all randomized participants (excluding the 3 complete withdrawals) regardless of the success of their initial stenting procedure; and restricting the analysis to those participants with successful stent insertions who were adherent to their randomized allocation. Similarly, one sensitivity analysis was performed to test the robustness of the co-primary stent patency analysis, restricting the analysis to those participants with successful initial stent insertions who were adherent to their randomized allocation. The adjusted mean differences/HRs, 97.5% confidence intervals, and P values were calculated. The covariates used for adjustment for these outcomes were the minimization variables.\n\nSubgroup analyses were limited to the two co-primary outcomes only and the four variables for which the randomization was minimized: age (≤70 years, >70 years), WHO performance status (0, 1, 2, 3, 4), tumour site (right colon, left colon/rectum), and indication for palliation (unresectable local disease, unresectable metastatic disease, unfit for surgery). The effects of these subgroups were examined by including a treatment group by subgroup interaction parameter in the original regression models for the co-primary analyses. The P values for the interaction and the adjusted mean differences/HRs and 97.5% confidence intervals were calculated. A forest plot was constructed for visual representation of the data for each co-primary outcome. The results of subgroup analyses were interpreted with caution and considered as hypothesis-generating only.\n\nSecondary time-to-event outcomes were analysed using Cox proportional hazard models, as per the co-primary outcome. Secondary binary outcomes were analysed using log-binomial models or, in cases of non-convergence, using Poisson models with robust standard errors. As per the co-primary analyses, 97.5% confidence intervals were calculated. For binary outcomes, both absolute and relative effect sizes are presented.\n\nFor all analyses, P values are two-sided and P = 0.025 was considered significant. Analyses were performed using SAS ® version 9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA) and Stata version 18.0.\n\nResults\n\nBetween 12 June 2017 and 27 April 2022, 1054 patients were assessed for eligibility; 640 (60.7%) were considered eligible. In total, 377 patients with obstructing colorectal cancer treated with palliative intent were randomized between covered and uncovered stents; 3 patients completely withdrew from the study, leaving 374 patients for analysis ( Fig. 1 ). 17 The database was locked for analysis on 27 June 2023, when all participants had reached the 6-month assessment and the corresponding outcome data had been entered onto the study database and validated as being ready for analysis.\n\nBaseline characteristics were balanced across treatment arms ( Table 1 ). The mean age at randomization was 73.7 (range 27–98) years, 63.6% were men, 69.8% had WHO performance status 0 or 1 (fully active or mobile all day), and almost half (48.1%) had a sigmoid tumour. The main indication for palliation was unresectable metastatic disease (49.5%), with the remainder being evenly split between unresectable local disease (25.4%) and considered unfit for surgery (25.1%). Of the patients, 93.3% were diagnosed using CT and 7.5% were diagnosed using MRI. Metastases were present in 71.9% of participants. Baseline characteristics for the modified ITT analysis data set were also balanced ( supplementary material S2 ).\n\nThe stenting success rate (defined as clinical relief of bowel obstruction) was 161 of 188 (85.6%) for covered stents and 166 of 186 (89.2%) for uncovered stents (adjusted incidence rate ratio 0.96 (97.5% c.i. 0.88 to 1.05); adjusted risk difference −0.03 (97.5% c.i. −0.10 to 0.05)) ( Table 2 ). Technical failure of initial stent insertion occurred in 22 of 188 (11.7%) of the covered stent group versus 16 of 186 (8.6%) of the uncovered stent group. The most common cause of stent technical failure was an inability to pass a guidewire into the colon proximal to the obstruction. Additionally, there were four patients in each group where stent insertion was not attempted and one post-randomization withdrawal in the covered stent group. Further details on the stent insertion procedure can be found in supplementary material S3 .\n\nAll those patients who did not have technically successful stent insertions were deemed non-adherent to their allocation (27 of 188 patients in the covered stent group versus 20 of 186 patients in the uncovered stent group). Of those who had technically successful stent insertions, six patients in the covered group and two patients in the uncovered group were known to be non-adherent to their allocation; information on stent design was not available for a further two patients in the covered group and three patients in the uncovered group and these patients were assumed to be non-adherent. This resulted in an overall adherence rate of 153 of 188 (81.4%) in the covered group and 161 of 186 (86.6%) in the uncovered group. Restricting the calculation to those with technically successful stent insertions (the modified ITT analysis population) gave adherence rates of 153 of 161 (95.0%) versus 161 of 166 (97.0%) respectively.\n\nThe crude health-related QoL measured using EORTC QLQ-C30 at 3 months after stent insertion was higher than that reported at baseline for both groups. This improvement was maintained for 24 months after stent insertion ( supplementary material S5 ). However, there was no difference in health-related QoL between the covered and uncovered stent groups for those patients successfully stented (modified ITT), adjusting for baseline global health score, age, WHO performance status, tumour site, and indication for palliation (adjusted mean difference 1.63 (97.5% c.i. −5.85 to 9.11), adjusted P = 0.624) ( Table 2 ). Subgroup analyses did not identify any characteristics that favoured a covered or uncovered stent ( supplementary material S4 ).\n\nThere was a trend towards fewer stent failures with uncovered stents, adjusting for age, tumour site, WHO performance status, and indication for palliation (HR 1.48 (97.5% c.i. 0.86 to 2.54), adjusted P = 0.104) ( Table 2 and Fig. 2a ). The difference was largely due to less stent migration ( Table 3 ). The subgroup analyses of stent patency showed that there may be some difference between the age subgroups (≤70 years versus > 70 years); in the group of patients aged >70 years stent failure was more likely to occur for covered stents (test for interaction P = 0.028). There were no differences seen in the other subgroup analyses for the stent patency outcome ( supplementary material S6 ).\n\nTwo sensitivity analyses were performed for the co-primary QoL outcome. The analysis that included all randomized participants regardless of technical success showed an adjusted mean difference of 1.76 (97.5% c.i. −5.46 to 8.98) and an adjusted P value of 0.583. The analysis that was restricted to those participants adherent to their randomized allocation showed a mean difference of 1.91 (97.5% c.i. −5.70 to 9.53) and an adjusted P value of 0.571. The sensitivity analysis for the co-primary stent patency outcome, restricting the analysis population to the adherent patients, showed an HR of 1.52 (97.5% c.i. 0.87 to 2.66) and an adjusted P value of 0.093. These results are in agreement with those reported for the co-primary analyses ( supplementary material S7 ).\n\nThe time to onset and nature of stent-related complications are shown in Table 3 . The majority of SAEs occurred during the first 30 days after insertion. The most important SAE, perforation, occurred in 11 of 161 (6.8%) patients in the covered group and 9 of 166 (5.4%) patients in the uncovered group. The total number of patients experiencing at least one SAE at any point between randomization and 6 months was 42 of 161 (26.1%) for covered stents and 29 of 166 (17.5%) for uncovered stents (chi-squared test P = 0.059). Stent migration was the most common SAE and was higher in the covered stent group, 26 of 161 (16.2%) versus 12 of 166 (7.2%) (chi-squared test P = 0.012). The rates and nature of stent-related complications for patients receiving chemotherapy are also shown in Table 3 . Only a quarter of patients received chemotherapy during the 6 months after randomization. Similar complication rates were noted in both groups. The feared complication of large bowel perforation during chemotherapy was rare; only one patient in each group developed perforation >30 days after stent insertion.\n\nEndoscopic re-intervention up to 6 months after randomization was attempted in 13 of 161 (8.1%) covered stent patients and 6 of 166 (3.6%) uncovered stent patients (adjusted risk ratio 2.08 (97.5% c.i. 0.70 to 6.19), adjusted P = 0.132; adjusted risk difference 0.04 (97.5% c.i. −0.01 to 0.09), adjusted P = 0.118). Stoma rates were low, with rates of 11 of 161 (6.8%) for covered stents and 11 of 166 (6.6%) for uncovered stents (adjusted risk ratio 0.91 (97.5% c.i. 0.36 to 2.29), adjusted P = 0.813; adjusted risk difference −0.01 (97.5% c.i. −0.06 to 0.05), adjusted P = 0.814).\n\nSurvival until withdrawal from the trial or at 6 months was 100 of 161 (62.1%) for covered stent patients and) 106 of 166 (63.9%) for uncovered stent patients (HR 0.98 (97.5% c.i. 0.65 to 1.47), adjusted P = 0.894). Overall survival was 40 of 161 (24.8%) for covered stent patients versus 42 of 166 (25.3%) for uncovered stent patients. A Kaplan–Meier plot for survival is shown in Fig. 2b .\n\nQoL at 3 months measured using the EORTC QLQ-CR29 disease-specific module for colorectal cancer did not show any differences between the two groups ( supplementary material S8 ).\n\nThe number and type of reported SAEs that were related to treatment were broadly balanced between those receiving uncovered and covered stents. An apparent increase in colonic ulcers was seen (19 covered versus 10 uncovered). Without differences in pain or perforation, the presence of colonic mucosal ulceration in likely of no significance.\n\nDiscussion\n\nStenting in the palliative setting can achieve high procedural and clinical success rates. Clinical success was not statistically significantly different between groups—85.6% in the covered stent group and 89.2% in uncovered stent group—giving an overall rate of 87.4%, which is comparable to the 86.1% clinical success rate reported in systematic reviews 18 .\n\nAfter stent insertion, QoL improved and was maintained for 24 months in those surviving for that length of time. No evidence that QoL was influenced by stent design was found, although the possibility of small differences cannot be ruled out. When considered with the high clinical success rate, this finding lends strong support for the use of stenting in the palliative setting.\n\nMol et al . 19 considered an EORTC QLQ-C30 score of <66.7% to indicate poor performance status. The median overall survival for those with a poor performance status was 10.4 months 19 . Patients in CReST2 consistently reported EORTC QLQ-C30 scores below this level, consistent with advanced disease at presentation.\n\nComparison of data from the present trial with data from previous trials is impaired by the small number of patients in randomized trials, different indications for stent treatment (bridge to surgery versus palliation), different patient populations (colorectal cancer versus extrinsic metastatic disease from other primary sites), and the potential bias inherent in non-randomized studies without blinding. A total of 144 patients treated with palliative intent have been reported in previous RCTs and 41 of these did not have colorectal cancer (28.5%) 8 , 11 . Therefore, CReST2 contributes to the understanding of this treatment pathway.\n\nOf those with an uncovered stent, 81.9% of stents remained patent until withdrawal/death or at 6 months and only 6.6% required a stoma. On a modified ITT basis, there was a trend to improved stent patency at 6 months in the uncovered stent group. Subgroup analysis additionally favoured uncovered stents for patients aged >70 years. Maintenance of stent patency has been previously reported to vary considerably from 53% to 90% until death or end of follow-up 20–22 . This wide variation may reflect patient heterogeneity, but more likely it relates to technical failures. CReST2 is associated with extensive training and cross-site learning, which is reflected in the positive outcomes reported.\n\nThe total number of patients who experienced at least one stent-related complication in the present trial was lower than the 34.0% reported in a meta-analysis of ten non-randomized and three randomized studies 23 . The principal stent-related complications are perforation, migration, and re-obstruction. In CReST2, the rate of perforation was not different between the groups (perforation occurred in 6.8% of patients with covered stents and 5.4% of patients with uncovered stents). An overall perforation rate of 7.4% was reported in a meta-analysis of 4086 patients 24 .\n\nStent migration was the most common complication. In the covered stent group, migration occurred more than twice as frequently as in the uncovered stent group. This is similar to previous reports, in the randomized study by Park et al ; 21.1% for covered stents and 1.8% for uncovered stents 8 and higher in three previous systematic reviews 7 , 12 , 25 .\n\nCovered stents were developed to reduce the risk of stent occlusion caused by tumour ingrowth. Increased tumour ingrowth has been reported with uncovered stents 7 , 8 , 12 , but this does not appear to worsen long-term patency. Stent occlusion, due to overgrowth of malignant tissue at the top and bottom of the stent, tumour ingrowth, and faecal impaction, occurred at a rate of 18% for all stent types 23 . In CReST2, stent blockage occurred at the lower end of the reported range and, importantly, no difference in rates of stent blockage was observed.\n\nEndoscopic re-intervention was attempted in 8.1% of covered stent patients and 3.6% of the uncovered stent group. Endoscopic re-intervention by stent-in-stent placement was clinically successful in 75% of cases with a median duration of patency of 170 days 26 and is recommended in European guidelines 27 . Concerns remain that the risk of colonic perforation is increased in ‘stented patients’ undergoing chemotherapy. In CReST2, a quarter of patients received chemotherapy during the 6 months after randomization. The feared complication of large bowel perforation during chemotherapy was rare; only one patient in each group developed perforation >30 days after stent insertion. A review of the literature in 2022 reported on 13 retrospective studies and one randomized trial that contributed only nine patients to the study. In the 682 patients included, chemotherapy was not associated with a higher risk of stent-related complications 28 .\n\nCollaborators\n\nJames Hill (Manchester University NHS Foundation Trust,
