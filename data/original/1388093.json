  "title": "Small Dose Ketamine Improves Postoperative Analgesia and Rehabilitation After Total Knee Arthroplasty.",
  "abstract": "We designed this study to evaluate the effect of small-dose intravenous ketamine in combination with continuous femoral nerve block on postoperative pain and rehabilitation after total knee arthroplasty. Continuous femoral nerve block with ropivacaine was started before surgery and continued in the surgical ward for 48 h. Patients were randomly assigned to receive an initial bolus of 0.5 mg/kg ketamine followed by a continuous infusion of 3 μg·kg -1 ·min -1 during surgery and 1.5 μg·kg -1 ·min -1 for 48 h (Ketamine group) or an equal volume of saline (Control group). Additional postoperative analgesia was provided by patient-controlled intravenous morphine. Pain scores and morphine consumption were recorded over 48 hours. The maximal degree of active knee flexion tolerated was recorded daily until hospital discharge. Follow up was performed 6 weeks and 3 months after surgery. The Ketamine group required significantly less morphine than the Control group (45 ± 20 mg versus 69 ± 30 mg; P < 0.02). Patients in the Ketamine group reached 90° of active knee flexion more rapidly than those in the Control group ( P < 0.02). Outcomes at 6 weeks and 3 months were similar in each group. These results confirm that ketamine is a useful analgesic adjuvant in perioperative multimodal analgesia with a positive impact on early knee mobilization.",
