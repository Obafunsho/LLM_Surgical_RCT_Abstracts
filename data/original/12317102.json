Although the pathophysiology remains poorly understood and still requires investigation, the role of genetic factors as susceptibility and causative factors is well described both in familial (fALS) and sporadic (sALS) ALS. This has led to the definition of hereditary ALS, which refers to ALS cases linked to pathogenic genetic variants, regardless of whether there is a known family history of ALS or frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) among first‐ or second‐degree relatives or not [ 2 ].\n\nIt is widely accepted that genetic factors account for more than two‐thirds of all fALS cases and approximately 10% of sALS cases [ 3 ]. Four genes are predominantly involved in both populations: abnormal C9orf72 expansions are observed in 40% of fALS and 6% of sALS cases, while SOD1 variants are present in 15% of fALS and 2% of sALS cases. TARDBP and FUS , the two remaining major genes, are pathogenic in approximately 3% of fALS and less than 1% of sALS cases [ 3 ].\n\nBased on these findings, the French rare disease network for ALS and other motor neuron diseases (FILSLAN) recommended, in 2021, systematic genetic screening for C9orf72 hexanucleotide repeat expansion (HRE) and SOD1 variants in all patients at the time of ALS diagnosis. This recommendation was based on two main factors: (1) the high prevalence of pathogenic C9orf72 HRE in intron 1, and (2) the potential to offer a targeted treatment with tofersen, an antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) that targets SOD1 mRNA, available through compassionate access while awaiting formal approval [ 4 ].\n\nTo evaluate the impact of this procedure in clinical practice and more accurately characterize the French ALS population, FILSLAN initiated a national, multicenter cohort study named GENIALS ( NCT04819555 ). The objective of this study was to provide a detailed analysis of SOD1 variants and C9orf72 HRE (G4C2 repeat expansions) in the French ALS population and to assess their effect on phenotype and disease progression.\n\nMaterial and Methods\n\nGENIALS was a multicenter, prospective cohort study including 1000 incident ALS patients in France. All participants fulfilled ALS diagnostic criteria according to the Airlie House criteria and were enrolled across the 22 ALS centers affiliated with FILSLAN between April 2021 and April 2022 [ 5 ] (Table S1 ).\n\nThe following parameters were collected at inclusion: date of birth, sex, family history of neurological diseases, date and site of onset, presence of upper motor neuron (UMN) and lower motor neuron (LMN) signs in the bulbar region, upper limbs (UL), lower limbs (LL), and thoracic region (for LMN only), as well as diagnostic delay. ALS diagnosis was classified according to the Airlie House criteria [ 5 ]. Additional assessments included the ALS Functional Rating Scale‐Revised (ALSFRS‐R), body mass index (BMI), and forced vital capacity (FVC), recorded at baseline, 6 months (M6), and 12 months (M12) of follow‐up. King's College and MiToS staging systems were applied at M6 and M12 only [ 6 , 7 ].\n\nfALS was defined as cases with a family history of ALS or FTLD; all other cases were considered sALS. We also recorded the time from the date of onset to wheelchair use, to initiation of percutaneous endoscopic or radiologic gastrostomy (PEG/PRG), to non‐invasive ventilation (NIV), and to tracheostomy.\n\nThe study was structured into three periods: Pre‐inclusion (P0): from symptom's onset to inclusion in the study (T0); First follow‐up period (P1): from T0 to month 6 (M6); Second follow‐up period (P2): from M6 to month 12 (M12).\n\nALS progression was evaluated using the slope of ALSFRS‐R decline, and patients were categorized as follows: slow progressors: slope < 0.3 points/month; intermediate progressors: slope between 0.3 and 0.8 points/month; and fast progressors: slope > 0.8 points/month.\n\nWeight loss was assessed at each time period (P0, P1, P2), while the decline in respiratory function was evaluated during P1 and P2 using FVC. FVC was not assessed during P0 due to the impossibility of estimating baseline respiratory function prior to disease onset.\n\nGenetic Analysis\n\nAfter obtaining writing consent, we collected blood samples on EDTA tubes for genetic analysis focused on SOD1 and C9orf72 genes. These analyses were made according to classical methods, using DNA sequencing for the SOD1 gene and genescan analysis for the C9orf72 gene. The pathogenic status of SOD1 variants was defined according to the AMCG guidelines [ 8 ]. The search for a pathological HRE (G4C2 > 30) in the C9orf72 gene was performed using a repeat‐primer PCR followed by fragment sizing on a 3130xl genetic analyzer (ThermoFisher) and data analysis by GeneScan software.\n\nStatistical Analysis\n\nDescriptive and inferential statistical analyses were conducted using JASP v0.18.3 software. Patient characteristics were expressed as frequencies (percentages) for categorical variables and as medians with interquartile ranges for continuous variables. Normality of distributions was assessed using the Shapiro–Wilk test, and missing data were documented.\n\nProportions comparisons were performed using Pearson's χ 2 test or Fisher's exact test, depending on applicability. For continuous variables, means were compared using the Student's t ‐test or the Mann–Whitney U test, as appropriate. When comparing more than two groups, one‐way ANOVA or the Kruskal–Wallis test was applied. Post hoc comparisons used χ 2 post hoc tests or ANOVA followed by Scheffé or Kruskal–Wallis post hoc tests, depending on data distribution. Repeated measures ANOVA was used to evaluate changes in variables over time using Friedman's test.\n\nEthical Considerations\n\nAll participants signed a consent form for genetic analyses and to be included in the study. They were fully informed of the objectives and constraints and their rights to withdraw at any time. The study was approved by the Committee for the Protection of Persons EST I of Dijon, France, and the French National Agency for the safety of Drugs and Health Products was informed (ANSM 2021‐A00442‐39).\n\nResults\n\nClinical and genetic data were available for 999 ALS patients included in this study; one patient withdrew consent and was therefore excluded.\n\nFamilial History in the GENIALS Population\n\nA total of 82 patients (8.2%) reported a family history of motor neuron diseases (Table 1 ). For seventy of them, familial history was limited to cases of ALS as follows: 38 patients had a single relative affected by ALS, 17 patients had two affected relatives, 7 patients had three, 5 patients reported four affected relatives, 1 patient reported five, 1 patient reported six, and 1 patient reported seven relatives diagnosed with ALS.\n\nOn the other hand, five patients reported only a familial history of FTLD: three reported a single FTLD case, one reported two cases, and one reported three cases. The remaining seven patients reported a familial history including both ALS and FTLD.\n\nIn the sALS group, investigation of broader familial neurological history identified other neurodegenerative diseases: Alzheimer's disease (AD) was reported in 79 patients, Parkinson's disease (PD) in 27, Lewy body disease (LBD) in 7, unspecified dementia in 12, and progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) in 1 case. Moreover, AD was reported among 60 first‐degree, 12 second‐degree, and 7 third‐degree relatives. PD was found in 16 first‐degree and 11 second‐degree relatives. LBD was reported in 6 first‐degree and 1 second‐degree relative. PSP was reported in one first‐degree relative.\n\nDuring the study period, 348 patients died. The mean disease duration was 22.5 ± 12.6 months in the overall population, 24.2 ± 13.3 months in the fALS group, and 22.3 ± 11.8 months in the sALS group (not significant).\n\nGenetic Results\n\nSixteen patients (1.6%) carried a pathogenic or probably pathogenic SOD1 variant, of which nine (56.2%) were diagnosed with sALS. Seventy‐six patients (7.6%) had an abnormal G4C2 repeat expansion in the C9orf72 gene, of which 39 patients (51%) were diagnosed with sALS (Tables 2 and 3 ). The other 907 patients (Non‐ SOD1 non‐ C9orf72 group) carried neither SOD1 variants nor C9orf72 HRE; however, other genetic variants were not analyzed for this study.\n\nSOD1 Population\n\nSOD1 variants were equally distributed between men and women and accounted for 8.5% of fALS cases (7/82) and 1.0% of sALS cases (9/917) (Table 2 ). None of the fALS patients reported any family history of FTLD.\n\nFifteen distinct variants were identified across the entire SOD1 gene and distributed as follows (Table 3 ): C7S and D12G in exon 1; P29R, M30V, and H44R in exon 2; G73S, G73R, and D77Del in exon 3; N87S, heterozygous D91A, and I114T in exon 4; V120L, G142A, and L145F in exon 5; and two C358‐10T>G variants in intron 4 (Figure 1 ). All variants, except for P29R and hetD91A, were classified as pathogenic (class 4 or 5) according to ACMG guidelines. The C358‐10T>G variant, located in an intronic region, was one of the most frequently reported variants in the French ALS population [ 9 ].\n\nThe median age of onset in the SOD1 group was 66.0 years (IQR: 57.7–71.0). Patients with sALS had a younger median age of onset at 60.0 years (IQR: 49.0–74.0), compared to 66.0 years (IQR: 65.5–69.5) for fALS, although this difference was not statistically significant ( T ‐test, p = 0.270). Men had a median age of onset of 62.0 years (IQR: 52.7–66.5), while in women it was 69.5 years (IQR: 64.5–75.0) ( T ‐test, p = 0.15).\n\nBulbar onset was observed only in women ( n = 2) while UL onset and LL onset were observed in both sexes (Table 2 ).\n\nAt the time of inclusion (T0), seven patients met the criteria for definite ALS, seven for probable ALS, and two for laboratory‐supported probable ALS.\n\nClinically, three patients (I114T, G142A, hD91A) presented with both UMN and LMN signs in all three regions, while one patient (N87S) had isolated LMN involvement in the lower limbs. One patient (H44R) did not show both UMN and LMN signs in LL, and two (G73S and P29R) complained of respiratory involvement at diagnosis. No patients reported cognitive symptoms.\n\nDuring P0, the ALSFRS‐R slope ranged from 0.12 to 3.17; two patients were slow progressors, eleven patients (68.75%) were intermediate progressors, and the remaining three were fast progressors (Table 2 ).\n\nBMI was highest in the SOD1 group, though not significantly different from other groups. Patients with the L145F variant showed the most pronounced weight loss (−30%). Other weight losses were observed in patients with M30V (16%), D12G (12.5%), and G73S (15%).\n\nDuring P1, the M30V variant was associated with the highest weight loss (16%), while other variants were associated with less than 6% weight loss. No patients underwent PEG placement during the study.\n\nNine patients eventually required the use of a wheelchair (C7S, D12G, M30V, G73S, D77Del, hetD91A, I114T, V120L, L145F), with a mean delay of 25.6 ± 21.6 months before wheelchair dependence. The longest delay was 35.9 months (D12G) and the shortest was 2.5 months (D77Del). Two patients (P29R and G73S) had respiratory involvement at diagnosis. Six patients (37.5%) required non‐invasive ventilation (NIV) during follow‐up, with a mean time to NIV of 28.5 ± 31.5 months.\n\nFour patients (M30V, H44R, D77Del, and G142A variants) died during the study. The average disease duration in these cases was 27.1 ± 14.1 months. Two patients (H44R and D77Del) had a short disease course (≤ 12 months), while the others had longer durations: 27.6 months for M30V and 56.8 months for G142A.\n\nC9orf72 Population\n\nSeventy‐six patients had an HRE (G4C2 > 30). Complete genotypes (number of repeats on the 2 alleles) were known for 74 of them: 2/> 30 observed in 43 cases, 5/> 30 in 13 cases, 4/> 30 in 6 cases, 8/> 30 in 4 cases, and 6/> 30 in 3 cases and 3/> 30, 7/> 30, 10/> 30, 12/> 30, 14/> 30, each found in one patient. Two patients were found with an HRE higher than 30 but the exact number on the other copy is unknown.\n\nThe median age of onset in the C9orf72 population was 61.0 years (IQR: 55.0–66.0), without differences between sALS and fALS subgroups (Mann–Whitney test, p = 0.992). By sex, the median age of onset was 62.0 years (IQR: 55.0–68.0) in women and 60.0 years (IQR: 55.0–65.0) in men (Mann–Whitney test, p = 0.205).\n\nThere was no statistically significant difference regarding the site of disease onset between sALS and fALS patients carrying C9orf72 expansions (Chi‐squared test, p = 0.52). However, thirteen patients (17.1%) in this group exhibited FTLD, a significantly higher proportion compared to non‐expanded C9orf72 patients ( p = 0.004) (Table 2 ).\n\nAt inclusion (T0), twenty‐five patients demonstrated both UMN and LMN signs in all three regions (bulbar, UL, and LL). Only one patient had isolated LMN signs across the three regions. During the follow‐up period, twenty patients underwent PEG/PRG placement, after a mean disease duration of 18.4 ± 14.1 months. In addition, thirty‐two patients (42.1%) required NIV, which was initiated after a mean delay of 15.7 ± 14.9 months.\n\nNon‐ SOD1 Non‐ C9orf72 Population\n\nFronto‐temporal lobe disturbances were observed in 45 patients (4.98%) within the cohort. Among them, 21 patients presented cognitive impairment attributed to AD.\n\nIn this subgroup, 737 patients carried at least one allele with two G4C2 repeats in the C9orf72 gene. The most common genotypes were 2–2 (observed in 265 patients, 35.9%), 2–5 (145 patients, 19.7%), and 2–8 (131 patients, 17.8%). Conversely, 176 patients (23.9%) did not carry any allele with two G4C2 repeats.\n\nPrevious studies have highlighted a significant impact of C9orf72 repeat configurations on disease duration in patients without abnormal expansions [ 10 ]. Consistent with these findings, we observed a significant difference in disease duration between deceased patients with and without at least one allele containing two G4C2 repeats. Specifically, the median disease duration was 19 (IQR: 14.0–26.0) months for those with at least one allele carrying two repeats ( n = 261), compared to 23.5 (IQR 17.0–31.0) months for those without ( n = 70, p = 0.007).\n\nComparative Analysis of Clinical Profiles\n\nThe C9orf72 group was characterized by the youngest age of onset, the shortest diagnostic delay, and the highest proportion of bulbar onset cases (Table 2 ). In contrast, the SOD1 group had a significantly higher frequency of lower limb onset compared to the other two groups ( p = 0.009).\n\nDisease progression from the baseline visit (T0) to the final follow‐up (T12) was assessed using repeated‐measures ANOVA (Figure 2 ). Patients with an abnormal C9orf72 expansion exhibited faster disease progression, as reflected by a steeper ALSFRS‐R slope—with mean slopes of 0.84 points/month during P0, 1.18 during P1, and 1.13 during P2. Their ALSFRS‐R scores remained consistently lower throughout follow‐up (Friedman test, p = 0.02).\n\nPatients without any detected variant showed a linear and stable slope of progression over time. The C9orf72 group showed a slight decrease in progression rate between P1 and P2. By contrast, the SOD1 group experienced a progressive deceleration of disease progression over time, with ALSFRS‐R slope values declining from 0.83 in P0 to 0.59 in P1, and 0.40 in P2 (Figure 2 ).\n\nFigure 3 illustrates the distribution of weight loss among patients who completed all three follow‐up visits. Across all genotypes, a common trend emerged: weight loss slowed during P1 and accelerated again in P2. This temporary reduction in weight loss during P1 was more marked in the SOD1 group and the non‐ SOD1 non‐ C9orf72 group, as indicated by an increase in the proportion of patients reporting no weight loss and a decrease in those with > 10% weight loss. In the C9orf72 group, however, the reduction in weight loss during P1 was less pronounced. While there was a decline in the proportion of patients with > 10% weight loss, the proportion of patients with no weight loss remained unchanged, suggesting a different weight loss dynamic in this subgroup.\n\nMedian forced vital capacity (FVC) at T0 was the lowest in the SOD1 group, at 61.5% (IQR: 50.5–78.0), compared to 93.5% (IQR: 69.5–104.25) in the C9orf72 group and 89.0% (IQR: 70.0–104.0) in the non‐ SOD1 non‐ C9orf72 population ( p = 0.022).\n\nDiscussion\n\nIn this study, we emphasize the importance of implementing generalized and systematic SOD1 and C9orf72 genetic screening in all ALS patients. Notably, nearly 50% of the variants (classes 4 and 5, according to ACMG criteria) identified in this cohort were found in patients without a familial history of ALS. This approach enabled ASO therapies administration to nine SOD1 sALS patients who would never have received such treatment if genetic testing had been restricted solely to fALS.\n\nThe observed frequency of SOD1 variants in our French cohort was 1.6%, consistent with earlier studies reporting prevalence rates between 1% and 6% [ 11 ]. No single variant predominated, with 15 distinct SOD1 variants identified. This underscores the genetic heterogeneity of SOD1 ‐related ALS in France, with variants distributed across all five exons and also involving intronic regions. These results confirm prior observations highlighting the relevance of non‐coding variants and emphasize the necessity of comprehensive gene analysis, including intronic sequences [ 9 ]. This recommendation has been adopted in the three national French laboratories accredited for ALS genetic testing.\n\nOur SOD1 cohort exhibited distinct phenotypic features: the median age of onset was older than typically reported in European cohorts, where onset is usually around 50 years [ 12 ]. As previously noted in a French cohort of 235 fALS patients, we did not observe a predominance of lower limb onset in familial cases compared to sporadic ones. Lower limb onset was present in only one‐third of fALS patients, rather than the expected 50% [ 13 ]. Bulbar onset was observed in two female patients, both aged over 80 years, which is approximately 20 years later than what is commonly described in the literature [ 12 ]. These cases involved the G142A variant (in a fALS patient) and hetD91A (in a sporadic case). Both presented upper and lower motor neuron signs in the bulbar region. This aligns with recent findings in an Italian SOD1 cohort, where bulbar onset occurred after 70 years, though those cases involved men [ 14 ]. These observations suggest that bulbar onset may indeed occur in SOD1 patients, particularly in their eighth decade of life.\n\nRegarding disease progression, we observed a notable slowing of ALSFRS‐R decline in the SOD1 group during P2, with a 50% reduction in the progression rate compared to earlier phases. The progression rate in this group was two to three times slower than in the C9orf72 group. Interestingly, body weight remained stable during P1 before declining in P2, whereas patients without variants or with C9orf72 HRE experienced continuous weight loss throughout follow‐up. The SOD1 group also demonstrated the slowest rate of weight loss over the course of the study. However, assessments lasted 12 months, preventing us from drawing further conclusions.\n\nFrom a respiratory standpoint, although forced vital capacity (FVC) was the lowest at diagnosis in the SOD1 group, the rate of decline was also milder compared to other groups. Two SOD1 variants (P29R, G73S) were associated with respiratory impairment at T0. Notably, we did not observe respiratory involvement linked to the L145F variant, contrary to our previous findings in a familial ALS pedigree [ 15 ]. Although data remain limited, the median disease duration for SOD1 patients was consistent with prior studies [ 12 ].\n\nThe frequency of abnormal C9orf72 G4C2 expansions in this cohort aligned with previous reports in French ALS populations [ 16 ]. As in earlier studies, we confirmed the predominance of bulbar onset in C9orf72 ‐positive patients [ 17 , 18 ]. These patients also exhibited a shorter diagnostic delay and more rapid disease progression, consistent with the more aggressive clinical course typically associated with C9orf72 ‐related ALS.\n\nIn our broader cohort, we noted a peak incidence in the eighth decade of life, supporting the observation that ALS is increasingly a late‐onset neurodegenerative disorder. Additionally, we uncovered a significant relationship between C9orf72 status and survival: patients without C9orf72 expansions and without a 2‐repeat allele had a longer disease duration—by approximately 4 months—compared to those with at least one 2‐repeat allele. Although this finding diverges from some previous studies, it may reflect population‐specific genetic differences. For instance, in Asian populations, C9orf72 HRE is rare, whereas SOD1 variants are far more prevalent. Additionally, among ALS patients with TARDBP variants (classes 4 and 5), we previously reported that upper limb onset is more frequent in Europe, whereas bulbar onset is more common in Asia, further suggesting that genotype–phenotype correlations may vary significantly across populations [ 19 ].\n\nCohort studies are needed in ALS, in particular to measure the potential impact of gene targeted therapeutic approaches. A recent cohort study focused on an ALS German population [ 20 ]. Our study strongly supports the implementation of systematic genetic screening for ALS patients at the time of diagnosis, regardless of family history. Since early 2025, we have extended this screening to a panel of the 30 most important genes linked to ALS and planned to conduct a comprehensive genetic study in the French ALS population. Such screening enables the early identification of pathogenic variants, ensuring that targeted treatments can be offered promptly. With the advent of gene therapy, the scope of screening will likely expand to include additional genes. In France, current clinical practice involves next‐generation sequencing (NGS) for 34 ALS‐related genes, performed in two phases: the first phase targets SOD1 (including exonic and flanking intronic regions) and C9orf72 . If no pathogenic variant is identified, the second phase screens the remaining genes. This stepwise approach reflects both the limited treatment options currently available for rare variants and their low frequency in the French ALS population.\n\nConflicts of Interest\n\nThe authors declare no conflicts of interest.
