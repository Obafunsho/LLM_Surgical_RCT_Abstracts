Previous studies indicated that the approximate half of ABI patients might experience dysphagia, due to damage to the neural substrates of swallowing. In cases of dysphagia, enteral nutrition via nasogastric tube (NGT) feeding is the most commonly used alternative method for energy intake in China and some countries. The complications of long-term indwelling NGT include mucosal injury, gastroesophageal reflux, aspiration and pneumonia [ 3 ]. In a few cases, prolonged NGT feeding has been associated with Nasogastric Tube Syndrome (NGTS) [ 4 ], characterized by sore throat, laryngeal edema or vocal paralysis with a risk of acute upper airway obstruction [ 5 ].\n\nGiven the decreased level of consciousness, reduced cough reflex, impaired sputum clearance and central hypoventilation, severe ABI patients commonly required tracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation support in the early stage [ 6 ]. Subsequently, tracheostomy may be required for patients facing challenges such as tracheal extubation failure, prolonged mechanical ventilation, or persistent difficulty in clearing sputum. Krishnamoorthy et al [ 6 ] reported that, among 94,082 hospitalizations for several ABI in the United States in the past 3 years, 32% received tracheostomies, and the proportion increased year by year during the study period. However, long-term indwelling of tracheostomy tube could also increase the risk of complications, such as tracheal stenosis, airway obstruction and infection [ 7 ]. Li M et al. showed that the frequency of tracheal stenosis after tracheostomy or tracheal intubation is 2.6% [ 8 ]. The pathophysiology of tracheal stenosis mainly involved the formation of excessive granulation tissue and tracheomalacia [ 9 ].\n\nIn addition, both NGT and tracheostomy could further impair swallowing function. First, the presence of NGT may cause pharyngeal mucosal injury, and disrupt sensory input during swallowing. Moreover, prolonged NGT indwelling might cause muscle atrophy in various structures involved in swallowing, impeding the recovery of swallowing function [ 10 ]. Similarly, dysphagia is a common occurrence (ranging from 11 to 93%) following tracheostomy [ 11 ]. Several posited factors contribute to this heightened risk, including disrupted hyolaryngeal excursion [ 12 ], reduced sensory input, atrophy of laryngeal structures, decreased subglottic air pressure [ 13 ], and inappropriate cuff pressure of tracheostomy tube [ 14 ]. However, limited research has examined the specific physiological effects of NGT and tracheostomy on the pharynx and larynx.\n\nConsequently, the primary rehabilitation objective for ABI patients should focus on the early removal of tracheostomy tube and nasogastric tube, aiming to reduce the duration of tube dependency. This approach can significantly reduce the potential complications associated with prolonged tube usage, enhance emotional and psychological well-being, alleviate the burden of rehabilitative care, and facilitate overall neurological recovery. To achieve these goals, a comprehensive investigation into the adverse effects linked to tracheostomy and NGT is essential.\n\nFiberoptic endoscopic examination of swallowing (FEES) provides a comprehensive method for assessing both the structure and function of the pharynx and larynx after ABI. This study aims to use FEES to explore alterations in pharyngeal and laryngeal physiological structure and function in ABI patients indwelling long-term nasogastric tube and tracheostomy, hopefully providing evidence to develop effective management strategies for ABI patients with NGT or tracheostomy.\n\nMaterials and methods\n\nParticipants\n\nThe retrospective study included patients admitted to rehabilitation department, Huashan Hospital, Fudan University from October 2019 to October 2023. Inclusion criteria were as follows, (1) patients diagnosed with ABI; (2) NGT indwelled for more than 1 month; (3) with stable condition of primary disease in the past week. Exclusion criteria were as follows: (1) history of reflux esophagitis, congenital developmental malformations, and chronic inflammation of the throat; (2) unstable vital signs requiring intensive cares; (3) history of head and neck cancer or radiotherapy.\n\nPatients were divided into two groups based on whether or not undergoing tracheostomy. The clinical characteristics including age, gender, types of brain injury, course of the disease, level of consciousness, activities of daily living (ADL) were investigated. The patients underwent fiberoptic endoscopic evaluation. The study protocol was revised and approved by the Huashan hospital Ethics Committee, and an exemption for informed consent was granted.\n\nFunction evaluation\n\nComa recovery scale—revised (CRS-R)\n\nCRS-R was recommended in the 2018 American Academy of Neurology (AAN) guidelines [ 15 ] and the 2020 European Academy of Neurology (EAN) guidelines [ 16 ]. CRS-R has been widely used to evaluate Disorders of Consciousness after ABI. The scale consists of 6 subscales designed to assess auditory function, receptive and expressive language, visuoperception, communication ability, motor functions, and arousal level. The total score ranges from 0 to 23. Higher scores indicate better consciousness.\n\nBarthel index\n\nBarthel Index is widely used to assess ADL, and the evaluation process is relatively simple and demonstrates a high level of reliability and sensitivity [ 17 ]. The Barthel Index categorizes the individual's ability to perform daily life activities into three levels. A score of more than 60 was considered to be mild functional impairment, capable of completing most part of daily activities independently. A score of 41–60 was considered to be moderately disabled, requiring considerable assistance to complete activities of daily living. A score below 40 meant severely dysfunctional, with most activities of daily living unable to be performed.\n\nFiberoptic endoscopic examination of swallowing (FEES)\n\nFEES was conducted following the protocol established by the manufacturer (Germany ATMOS). All endoscopic examinations were conducted with the patients positioned at a 60°recline, with the head and neck maintained in a neutral position (supported by a pillow to prevent hyperextension). The position was maintained with the assistance of two staff members to ensure consistency throughout the procedure. During the examination, the endoscopic tip was inserted to the pharyngeal through the nasal cavity, reaching a unified depth upon achieving a comprehensive view of the laryngeal vestibule. The structural and functional attributes of the pharynx and larynx were evaluated by the morphology of the arytenoid cartilage, epiglottis, vocal folds, tongue base, and pharyngeal cavity.\n\nData analysis\n\nSPSS 22.0 (IBM Corporation, Armonk, NY, USA) was used for data analysis. The quantitative data were expressed as mean ± standard deviation (SD). Descriptive statistics of normally distributed data were compared using independent T test. Comparison of proportion was evaluated by Chi-square test. A p value < 0.05 indicated that the difference was statistically significant.\n\nResults\n\nThe basic characteristics of the NGT group and NGT–TRACH (nasogastric tube with tracheostomy) group\n\nIn this study, 103 ABI patients indwelling nasogastric tube with or without tracheostomy were enrolled (38 with tracheostomy). The mean age of all patients was 56.10 ± 16.14 years, with a disease duration of 6.87 ± 7.92 months and a duration of NGT feeding of 6.81 ± 7.94 months. The mean duration of tracheostomy was 8.05 ± 7.98 months. The primary diagnosis associated with ABI was trauma in 25 patients, stroke in 70 patients, and 8 in other diseases, such as neoplasm and anoxia. There was no significant difference in age, gender, types of ABI, course of the disease and duration of NGT feeding between the NGT group and NGT–TRACH group ( p > 0.05). The CRS-R score and Barthel Index in NGT group were significantly higher than those in NGT–TRACH group ( p < 0.05), as shown in Table 1 .\n\nThe morphology of pharynx and larynx by FEES\n\nIn the research, we found that most of these patients presented abnormal morphology of pharynx and larynx (See Table 2 ), mainly as follows: arytenoid edema and malposition, abnormal shape and malposition of epiglottis, anomaly of vocal folds, glossoptosis severity and the anomaly of pharyngeal cavity.\n\nArytenoid edema and malposition\n\nArytenoid Edema with varying degrees was observed in 87.7% of nasal feeding patients and 94.7% of nasal feeding patients with tracheostomy. We graded the severity of arytenoid edema according to the proportion of the arytenoid cartilages covering the medial margin of the vocal folds: Grade 0: normal; Grade 1: mild edema (covering ≤ 1/3 of the medial margin of the vocal folds); Grade 2: moderate edema (covering ≥ 1/3 and ≤ 1/2 of the medial margin of the vocal folds); Grade 3: severe edema (covering ≥ 1/2 of the medial margin of the vocal folds or completely obscuring the medial margin of the vocal folds) (see Fig. 1 ). In addition, unilateral or bilateral arytenoid edema were observed in different patients (see Fig. 2 ). Arytenoid malposition was observed in 13.8% of nasal feeding patients and 18.4% of nasal feeding patients with tracheostomy. The malposition of the arytenoid cartilage was determined by whether or not the height of the arytenoid cartilages on both sides was unequal (left side higher/right side higher) (see Fig. 3 ).\n\nAbnormal shape and malposition of epiglottis\n\nMorphological abnormality of epiglottis shape included edema, omega shape (sharply curved), flat shape, and unilateral deviation (see Fig. 4 ). Epiglottis was classified as flat if its medial part lacked the characteristic anterior convexity. Epiglottis was classified as omega-shaped (sharply curved), if the angle between its lateral parts was less than 90˚ [ 18 ].The abnormal rate was present in 40.0% of nasal feeding patients and 65.8% of nasal feeding patients with tracheostomy, and there was a significant difference between the two groups (p < 0.05). Epiglottis malposition was found in 24.6% of nasal feeding patients and 21.1% of nasal feeding patients with tracheostomy. The epiglottis position included normal, unilateral deviation, and anterior tilt (see Fig. 5 ).\n\nAnomaly of vocal folds\n\nThe anomaly of vocal folds encompassed structure abnormality and movement abnormality. The former included ventricular band edema and the presence of thick and short vocal folds (see Fig. 6 ). The latter involved the asymmetry of bilateral vocal fold movement while asking the patient to phonate or cough. It was roughly categorized into the following grades: Grade 0 denoting a normal condition, Grade 1 denoting unilateral weakness, Grade 2 denoting unilateral paralysis, Grade 3 denoting bilateral weakness, and Grade 4 denoting bilateral paralysis (see Fig. 7 ). The rate of Vocal fold structure abnormality was observed in 78.5% of nasal feeding patients and 78.9% of nasal feeding patients with tracheostomy, not significant between the two groups. The rate of Vocal fold movement abnormality was present in 86.2% of nasal feeding patients and 89.5% of nasal feeding patients with tracheostomy, also no significance.\n\nGlossoptosis severity and the anomaly of pharyngeal cavity\n\nThe severity of glossoptosis was measured by the tongue base's location. It was roughly categorized into the following grades: Grade 0 indicating a normal condition, Grade 1 indicating the tongue base's proximity to the epiglottis, and Grade 2 indicating the tongue base's proximity to the posterior pharyngeal wall (see Fig. 8 ). Glossoptosis was found in 16.9% of nasal feeding patients and 36.8% of nasal feeding patients with tracheostomy, and there was a significant difference between the two groups ( p < 0.05). The abnormal appearance of the pharyngeal cavity mainly included abnormal protrusion and pharyngeal stenosis (see Fig. 9 ). The abnormal rate was found in 26.2% of nasal feeding patients and 47.4% of nasal feeding patients with tracheostomy, and there was a significant difference between the two groups ( p < 0.05).\n\nDiscussion\n\nThis study revealed that most of ABI patients in the two groups displayed structural alterations in the laryngeal and pharyngeal regions. FEES revealed no significant differences in most parameters, except for abnormalities in epiglottic shape, glossoptosis, and pharyngeal stenosis, despite variations in the severity of injuries between the two groups, as assessed by CRS-R and the Barthel Index. These results implicated a potential association between tracheostomy and these alterations in the pharyngeal cavity.\n\nThe present study showed that most of the two groups’ patients with nasogastric tube placement exhibited abnormality of pharyngeal and laryngeal structure, consistent with previous studies [ 19 – 22 ]. The precise mechanisms for these changes are unknown, probably related to the followings: the first is that the dynamic friction and compression of NGT against surrounding tissues, especially during coughing and moving of head and neck. The second is that continuous NGT weakens the natural barrier of the lower esophageal sphincter, increasing the risk of gastroesophageal reflux (GER). The combination of the two factors may potentially lead to mucosal ulceration, inflammation and edema in the region.\n\nIn addition, it was observed that more than 20% of patients in the two groups exhibited abnormal position of the epiglottis, and approximately 15% patients of the two groups having displacements of arytenoid cartilages, which are possibly due to the pressure exerted by the NGT on the ipsilateral aryepiglottic fold and the torticollis after brain injury in some patients. Moreover, the abnormal shape of the epiglottis was observed in 40% of patients, which may be associated with overall severe edema in the pharynx and glossoptosis et al., leading to abnormal traction of both aryepiglottic folds.\n\nThis study also found that the incidence of epiglottis shape abnormality, glossoptosis, abnormal pharyngeal protrusion and stenosis were significantly higher in patients undergoing both nasal feeding and tracheostomy than those receiving nasal feeding alone. The potential factors contributing to these observed outcomes include the absence of physiological airflow, the reduced frequency and amplitude of laryngeal elevation [ 23 ], and poor blood circulation and lymphatic reflux [ 24 ].\n\nBased on the above finding, it is important to make some modifications in the management strategy of prolonged NGT and tracheostomy. First, FEES evaluation is necessary before making a treatment plan for brain injury patients with prolonged NGT and tracheostomy. Second, for NGT patients with dysphagia, early initiation of intermittent oro-esophageal tube feeding (IOE) could effectively reduce residual pharyngeal secretions, alleviate arytenoid edema, improve epiglottis shape, and enhance vocal cord movement [ 25 ]. In the case of prolonged tracheostomized patients, the timely implementation of a speaking valve and tube plug training could be attempted to enhance physiological airflow, helpful to stop from the development of pharyngeal stenosis. In addition, if patients with prolonged tracheostomy could not endure the capping test, we should check if there is pharyngeal stenosis.\n\nThis study demonstrates several strengths. This study comprehensively and systematically demonstrated the morphological changes of pharyngeal and laryngeal structure in ABI patients with NGT and tracheostomy by FEES. Furthermore, this study demonstrates that tracheostomy may lead to alterations in epiglottis shape abnormality, glossoptosis and pharyngeal stenosis, which has significant implications for clinical management strategies of long-term tracheostomy patients.\n\nCertainly, there are some limitations for this study, first, the study is a cross-sectional study. Further research is required to quantitatively analyze the relationship between structural changes and functional swallowing outcomes using tools, such as the penetration–aspiration scale (PAS) and quantitative FEES assessments. Longitudinal studies may also clarify the progression of these changes over time. In addition, the influence of subjective factors among assessors has the potential to affect the outcomes. In our future studies, we intend to integrate quantitative analysis by incorporating measured values to mitigate inaccuracies and conduct assessments for reliability and validity. In addition, it is necessary to point out that vocal cord movement disorders in some patients might be associated with the primary disease (e.g., brainstem injury) and not entirely attributable to NGT or tracheostomy. Furthermore, a limitation of this research is the inadequate exploration of the underlying significance of particular indicators, necessitating additional investigation and discourse.\n\nConclusion\n\nNasogastric tube feeding and tracheostomy had detrimental impacts on the pharyngeal and laryngeal structure and function of brain injury patients. FEES provides an effective method for assessing the pharynx and larynx after brain injury. These findings of FEES might be helpful to make a proper treatment strategy in the management of acquired brain injury (ABI) patients with long-term nasogastric tubes and tracheostomies.\n\nSupplementary Information\n\nAdditional file 1",
