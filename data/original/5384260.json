  "abstract": "Background: Little is known about anorectal function and quality of life after chemoradiation followed by local excision, which is an alternative to total mesorectal excision for selected early rectal cancer patients.\n\nObjective: Prospectively assess anorectal function and health-related quality of life of T2N0 rectal cancer patients treated with an alternative approach\n\nDesign: Prospective phase II trial\n\nSettings: Multicentric study (ACOSOG trial Z6041)\n\nInterventions: Patients with stage cT2N0 rectal adenocarcinomas were treated with an oxaliplatin/capecitabine-based chemoradiation regimen followed by local excision.\n\nMain Outcome Measure: Anorectal function and quality of life were assessed at enrollment and 1 year postoperatively with the Fecal Incontinence Severity Index, Fecal Incontinence Quality of Life scale and Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Colorectal questionnaire. Results were compared, and multivariable analysis was performed to identify predictors of outcome.\n\nResults: Seventy-one (98%) patients were evaluated at enrollment and 66 (92%) at 1 year. Compared to baseline, no significant differences were found on Fecal Incontinence Severity Index scores at 1 year. Fecal Incontinence Quality of Life results were significantly worse in the lifestyle (p<0.001), coping/behavior (p<0.001) and embarrassment (p=0.002) domains. There were no differences in the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy overall score, but the physical well-being subscale was significantly worse and emotional well-being was improved after surgery. Treatment with the original chemoradiation regimen predicted worse depression/self-perception and embarrassment scores in the Fecal Incontinence Quality of Life, and male sex was predictive of worse scores in the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy overall score and trial outcome index.\n\nLimitations: Small sample size, relatively short follow-up and absence of information before cancer diagnosis.\n\nConclusion: Chemoradiation followed by local excision had minimal impact on anorectal function 1 year after surgery. Overall quality of life remained stable, with mixed effects on different subscales. This information should be used to counsel patients about expected outcomes.",
