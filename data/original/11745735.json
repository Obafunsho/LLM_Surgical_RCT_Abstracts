  "full_text": "Introduction\n\nIn recent years, the incidence of thyroid cancer (TC) has been increasing, with 43 720 new cases of TC in the United States and 202 600 new cases in China per year, ranking the seventh in the United States and the second in China among all malignant tumors in female 1 , 2 . Differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) is the most common type of TC 3 . The main treatment for DTC is surgery, and the 10-year survival rate of postoperative patients is as high as 90–95% 4 . For better good prognosis of patients with DTC, more attention should be paid to achieving better postoperative health-related quality of life (HRQOL). HRQOL is a multidimensional concept including impacts of the disease on physical, psychological, social, spiritual well-being 5 , which could be measured by patient-reported outcomes (PROs). PROs could measure any aspect of patients’ health status directly reported by the patients including HRQOL 6 , which is more sensitive, reliable, comprehensive than that evaluated by clinical staff.\n\nPatient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) directly collect patients’ information on health outcomes in the form of standardized questionnaires. Thus far, PROMs have been increasingly used as primary outcome measures for research and clinical decision-making. There are a number of PROMs available to measure HRQOL in patients with TC, as reviewed in previous literature 7 – 9 . However, some of these reviews have included studies in patients with benign thyroid disease 8 , 9 . Given the different treatments for benign thyroid disease and TC as well as different prognosis, PROMs for the two populations may be different. In addition, a review by Roth et al . 7 aimed to identify HRQOL instruments in a TC population, and present the psychometric properties of these questionnaires. However, Roth et al . only described generic, cancer-specific, and TC-specific PROMs, but did not review PROMs related to postoperative symptoms and radioiodine-induced symptoms of TC patients, which are also an important part of HRQOL.\n\nPrevious studies have shown that most postoperative TC patients have symptoms, such as voice change 10 , neck and shoulder discomfort 11 , etc., and psychological problems 12 , such as anxiety, depression, and stress, and most patients after radioiodine therapy experience xerostomia 13 , and all these issues can affect patients’ HRQOL. Therefore, to measure the effect of postoperative symptoms, psychological problems, and symptoms after radioiodine therapy on HRQOL, various PROMs have emerged 11 , 14 – 16 . However, these PROMs have not been reviewed in previous studies, and frequencies with which different PROMs were applied in previous studies have not been described. Generally, PROMs are categorized as generic and disease-specific or condition-specific. However, to better distinguish the range measured by different PROMs, so that clinical researchers can better select appropriate PROMs, we innovatively divided PROMs into five categories, which has not been done in the previous reviews. Because of these research gaps, we aimed to systematically review and categorize all PROMs that have been applied to measure HRQOL in patients with DTC.\n\nMethods\n\nThis systematic review was conducted in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA, Supplemental Digital Content 1, http://links.lww.com/JS9/D117 , Supplemental Digital Content 2, http://links.lww.com/JS9/D118 ) statement 17 and was guided by the Assessing the Methodological quality of Systematic Reviews (AMSTAR, Supplemental Digital Content 3, http://links.lww.com/JS9/D119 ) guidelines 18 for methodological quality. The protocol was registered in the PROSPERO database.\n\nSearch strategy\n\nArticles were searched in PubMed and EMBASE from January 1900 to September 2023. Two researchers (C.Y.C. and L.C.) had jointly determined the search terms, which mainly centered around two aspects, namely ‘thyroid cancer’ and ‘patient-reported outcome measures’ or ‘questionnaires’ or ‘scales’ or ‘quality of life’ or ‘health-related quality of life’.\n\nStudy selection\n\nTo be considered, the studies needed to meet the inclusion criteria. The inclusion criteria were as follows: 1) articles were limited to patients with TC; 2) authors developed and named a PROM to evaluate HRQOL for TC population; 3) original articles utilized questionnaires to assess TC-related HRQOL; 4) the questionnaires contained in the articles were completed by patients; 5) articles were published in English; 6) full-text version of articles was available online. The exclusion criteria were as follows: 1) articles including patients with anaplastic or medullary TC; 2) the PROM was used as a comparison tool in a validation study of another tool; 3) review articles, conference abstracts, case reports, and articles without abstracts; 3) PROMs assessing environment characteristics, such as social or financial support, behavior characteristics, such as eating or working behavior; 4) patient-reported experience measures (PREMs), such as disease acceptance, illness perception, or treatment satisfaction. Based on these eligibility criteria, the title and abstract and the full-text of the articles were screened independently by two groups of researchers (X.L.J., L.L., X.Y.Q., H.J.C., S.C.Y., and W.X.). From the identified studies reference lists, additional eligible articles were checked by the researchers (L.L. or Z.Y.Q.). If there was disagreement between two researchers, the opinion of a third researcher (D.W.) was sought to reach consensus.\n\nData extraction and synthesis\n\nInformation on PROMs from the included studies, such as name, development language, target population, (sub)scale name, number of items per (sub)scale, completion time, and validation (validity and reliability of PROMs in different populations at least), was extracted and analyzed by two groups of researchers (X.L.J., L.L., X.Y.Q., H.J.C., S.C.Y., and Z.Y.Q.). The frequency with which PROMs were utilized in the included studies was also summarized. Based on the fact that PROMs were categorized as generic and disease-specific or condition-specific, we further refined the categories of the PROMs utilized in DTC patients. First, the category of generic PROMs was retained. Second, the category of disease-specific PROMs was changed to DTC-related PROMs. Third, based on the factors affecting DTC patients’ HRQOL, the category of condition-specific PROMs was further refined to the following categories: operation-related PROMs, radioiodine-related PROMs, and psychology-related PROMs. According to the category criteria, the researchers (L.L., X.Y.Q., H.J.C., S.C.Y., Z.Y.Q., and W.X.) divided the different PROMs into five categories. If there was disagreement between two researchers, a third researcher (D.W.) was consulted to reach consensus. If relevant information on PROMs was not found in the included studies, the researchers searched for it in PubMed, Google, or other resources.\n\nCategory criteria: Target population. For example, PROMs for general population and cancer population were generally categorized into universal PROMs; PROMs for TC population and head-and-neck cancer (including TC) population were generally categorized into DTC-related PROMs; PROMs for patients with different symptoms were generally categorized into operation/radioiodine-related PROMs; PROMs for emotional disorders were generally categorized into psychology-related PROMs. (Sub)Scale name and what PROMs were measured in the literature. To further classify PROMs accurately, we considered (sub)scale name and what PROMs were measured in the literature. For example, PROMs for measuring emotional disorders in the general population were classified into psychology-related PROMs; PROMs for measuring postoperative symptoms in the TC population were classified into operation-related PROMs.\n\nResults\n\nBased on the described search strategy, a total of 10 494 articles were identified. Among them, 292 articles fulfilled all of the criteria. Additional 38 eligible studies were identified by reference check. An overview of the included articles can be found in Appendix 1 (Supplemental Digital Content 4, http://links.lww.com/JS9/D120 ). In total, these studies utilized 96 different PROMs (Fig. 1 ).\n\nCharacteristics of the PROMs\n\nThe PROMs were developed in 12 different languages, most often in English ( N =94), followed by Finnish ( N =2), Dutch ( N =2), and Hebrew ( N =2). EQ-5D WHOQOL-BREF, and ThyCa-HRQOL were developed in more than one language at the same time. Of the 96 PROMs, there were 14 different PROMs specifically developed for patients with TC. Tables 1 – 5 present a summary of the (sub)scale name and items of the included PROMs, as well as comments about them. For the 96 PROMs, the reported completion time varied from 1 to 20 min. With regard to validation of the PROMs, 88/96 PROMs were validated in different populations, while 8/96 PROMs (TQOLI, TVQ, VIS, VII-5, SIS, UADS, CSQ, and FoR) have not yet been validated.\n\nDifferent categories of PROMs\n\nAccording to the category criteria the PROMs were classified into five categories (Figs 2 – 4 ), namely universal PROMs (16/96) (Fig. 2 A), DTC-related PROMs (Fig. 2 B), radioiodine-related PROMs (Fig. 2 C), operation-related PROMs (Fig. 3 ), and psychology-related PROMs (Fig. 4 ).\n\nOf the 96 PROMs, there were 16 different universal PROMs (Fig. 2 A, Table 1 ). The most commonly used universal PROM was SF-36, followed by EORTC QLQ-C30, and SF-12. Among the 16 unique PROMs, only PedsQL was developed for assessing the quality of life in the pediatric population. Eleven PROMs were grouped into DTC-related PROMs (Fig. 2 B, Table 2 ). THYCA-QOL was the most commonly used, followed by COH-TV and ThyPRO. Of the 96 PROMs, there were four different radioiodine-related PROMs (Fig. 2 C, Table 3 ), of which XI (2/5) was the most commonly utilized.\n\nOf the 96 PROMs, 37 PROMs were classified as operation-related PROMs (Fig. 3 , Table 4 ). Depending on the symptoms caused by surgery, the operation-related PROMs were subdivided into nine types of PROMs, namely voice (6/37), pain (2/37), scar (5/37), swallow (8/37), fatigue (6/37), sleep (4/37), neck and shoulder discomfort (4/37), cough (1/37), and sex (1/37) (Fig. 3 ). Among them, VHI, VAS, PSAS, SIS, MFI-20,and PSQI were the most commonly used PROMs. TVQ, VIS, VII-5, SIS, UADS, and CSQ were specifically developed for thyroidectomized patients.\n\nNext, 28/96 PROMs were grouped into psychology-related PROMs (Fig. 4 , Table 5 ). Based on different emotional states, the psychology-related PROMs were subdivided into four types of PROMs, namely anxiety/depression/stress (21/28), fear of surgery/disease progression/recurrence/survival (4/28), self-esteem/discrimination (2/28), and attention (1/28). Among them, HADS and FoP-Q were the most commonly used PROMs. TCSPDS was specifically developed for TC patients. Notably, only MASC was developed for assessing anxiety levels in children.\n\nDiscussion\n\nThis systematic review provided an overview of the available PROMs applied in patients with DTC with a focus on comprehensively reviewing PROMs, innovatively categorizing PROMs, and describing the frequency with which PROMs were used in previous studies.\n\nIn many studies, authors have generally compared the HRQOL of the general population or patients with benign thyroid disease with that of the TC population by SF-36 19 – 36 . In addition, some researchers have argued that cancer-specific PROMs are not optimal to assess long-term HRQOL in TC patients many years after treatment; instead, SF-36 may be better for assessment of the patients’ long-term HRQOL 37 . However, EORTC-C30 has been also used in many studies to measure HRQOL in TC patients 30 , 38 – 44 due to the fact that EORTC-C30 can not only evaluate cancer-specific HRQOL, but can also capture some issues associated with TC, such as fatigue and insomnia. Moreover, the validity and reliability of EORTC-C30 have been validated in adult Filipinos with DTC 45 . Although EQ-5D has been the most commonly used preference-based generic utility instrument, due to the higher floor effect, SF-6D was more sensitive to treatment effects of DTC than EQ-5D 46 , 47 . It is worth noting that the PROMIS-29 metric is T-score, which makes it possible and more convenient for researchers to compare the HRQOL in the general population or other cancer patients with that of DTC patients 48 , 49 .\n\nAs for DTC-related PROMs, Uslar et al . 8 systematically reviewed nine malignant thyroid disease PROMs and described the content, reliability, and validity of only six PROMs (three questionnaires were only mentioned). Unlike the review by Uslar et al ., our present review did not include two unnamed DTC-related PROMs, and we categorized ThyPRO into DTC-related PROMs. The systematic review by Roth et al . 7 identified 15 PROMs applied in the TC population, summarized psychometric properties, and described the results of the included HRQOL studies. Compared with three categories used by Roth et al ., our study reviewed more PROMs used in the TC population and categorized them into five types. In the review by Wong et al . 9 , a COSMIN checklist was used to grade the methodological quality and overall evidence levels of 14 included thyroid-specific PROMs. Given that most of what Wong et al . graded were benign thyroid disease PROMs, further research was needed to measure the methodological quality of TC-specific PROMs using a COSMIN checklist and to provide a recommendation.\n\nWith regard to radioiodine-related PROMs, most PROMs used in previous studies evaluated the effect of radioiodine-induced xerostomia on TC patients’ HRQOL 13 , 14 , 50 , and only one questionnaire utilized in a study assessed the impact of radioiodine-induced anorexia on HRQOL 51 . Thus far, few studies have applied specific PROMs to assess TC patients’ HRQOL after radioiodine therapy, and there has been a lack of PROMs developed specifically for the TC population after radioiodine therapy, therefore, more studies are needed.\n\nMost of the studies that measured TC patients’ HRQOL after thyroidectomy measured the impact of voice changes on HRQOL using VHI-10/30 10 , 52 – 60 . Notably, although TVQ, VIS and VII-5 were developed for thyroidectomized patients to evaluate voice impairments, none of them were validated and none underwent phase IV testing. In most studies 61 – 69 , VAS was often used for postoperative pain assessment after open thyroidectomy versus endoscopic thyroidectomy (transoral, axillary, axillo-breast, areola, and retroauricular) versus robotic thyroidectomy. With regard to postoperative scarring, it is worth mentioning that both PSAS and PSAQ have been validated in thyroidectomized patients 70 , 71 , and the reason why PSAS was more often used may be due to its fewer items 72 – 83 . Swallowing discomfort often exists in TC patients after surgery, which has generally assessed by SIS developed for thyroidectomized patients; however, it has not been validated 16 , 52 , 84 – 93 . Both MFI-20 and BFI are commonly used to evaluate post-treatment fatigue in TC patients, but no fatigue PROM has been developed specifically for TC patients. There were eight studies measuring the sleep quality of TC patients after surgery, most of which used PSQI and only one utilized ISI 94 – 101 . Hitherto, there has been no review of sleep quality in TC, so further research should be conducted based on this review. To date, only four studies have investigated the impact of postoperative shoulder and neck discomfort on the HRQOL of TC patients by four different PROMs 11 , 87 , 102 , 103 , and no PROMs have been developed specifically for TC patients. Therefore, more research is needed. Wu et al . 104 firstly and innovatively reported the association between postoperative cough and thyroidectomy by LCQ. Currently, there are only two studies specifically evaluating the effect of postoperative cough on TC patients’ HRQOL 104 , 105 ; hence, further research is needed on this aspect. Only one study measured patient-partner relationship quality in TC patients 106 , and more research is needed to support that study. Following thyroid surgery, hypocalcemia has frequently been observed 107 , which can lead to numbness in the hands or feet. Nevertheless, no PROMs have been developed specifically for TC patients with hypocalcemia up to this point. More research is required to develop specific PROMs.\n\nMany of the included studies have focused on the psychological status after TC treatment, such as anxiety, depression, and stress, which were often measured by HADS, BDI, and STAI 32 , 108 – 115 . When we determined the PROMs, we did not include HAMA and HAMD because none of them are self-rated scales. In some of the included studies, authors measured the psychological status of fear of disease progression in TC patients by FoP-Q 109 , 116 – 121 .\n\nThis study reveals a large number of PROMs for measuring the HRQOL of DTC patients. We described the frequency with which PROMs were utilized for measuring the HRQOL of DTC patients in previous studies. In this way, not only can we directly understand which PROM is the most commonly used, but we could also indirectly know which aspects of HRQOL have been studied more extensively. The 96 PROMs were innovatively classified into five categories, namely universal PROMs, DTC-related PROMs, radioiodine-related PROMs, operation-related PROMs, and psychology-related PROMs. Combining the relevant information and frequency of PROMs utilization, it can provide convenience and reference for researchers to select PROMs across different categories.\n\nThis systematic review has several limitations. First, we only described the (sub)scale names of PROMs, which is not enough for researchers to accurately select PROMs, so it would be better for researchers to view the content of the PROMs to determine which aspects of HRQOL have been assessed. Second, selecting a reliable PROM also requires evaluating measurement properties with a COSMIN checklist and giving recommendations, similar to the study by Wong et al . 9 . However, due to the large number of PROMs involved in this review, measurement properties were not evaluated, and further research is needed. Third, the criteria for each category were subjective. Finally, despite the extensive search, we determined 12% of the included studies from reference lists. However, based on this extensive search strategy, our systematic review identified 96 PROMs, which is far more than those included in previous reviews 7 , 8 .\n\nConclusion\n\nA large number of PROMs to evaluate all aspects of HRQOL are available for patients with DTC. Combining the relevant information and frequency of PROMs utilization, it can provide convenience and reference for researchers to select PROMs across different categories. However, a more detailed critical appraisal of the PROMs used in various clinical scenarios is required. Additionally, PROMs usage frequency in previous studies can indirectly indicate the comprehensiveness or gaps in HRQOL aspects studied, guiding further review or research.\n\nEthical approval\n\nNot applicable.\n\nConsent\n\nNot applicable.\n\nSource of funding\n\nThis work was supported by the grant 2022-YF05-01847-SN from the Chengdu Science and Technology Bureau technology innovation research and development project.
