  "title": "One-Year Survival and Neurologic Outcomes after Pediatric Open-Chest Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation",
  "abstract": "Background:: Limited data exist regarding neurobehavioral outcomes of children treated with open-chest cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). Our objective was to describe neurobehavioral outcomes one year post-arrest among children who received open-chest CPR during in-hospital cardiac arrest; and explore factors associated with one-year survival and survival with good neurobehavioral outcome.\n\nMethods:: The study is a secondary analysis of the Therapeutic Hypothermia after Pediatric Cardiac Arrest In-Hospital Trial. Fifty-six children who received open-chest CPR for in-hospital cardiac arrest were included. Neurobehavioral status was assessed using the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales, Second Edition (VABS-II) at pre-arrest baseline and 12-months post-arrest. Norms for VABS-II are 100 (mean) ±15 (SD). Outcomes included 12-month survival, 12-month survival with VABS-II decreased by ≤15 points from baseline, and 12-month survival with VABS-II ≥70.\n\nResults: Of 56 children receiving open-chest CPR, 49 (88%) were post-cardiac surgery and 43 (77%) were <1 year old. Forty-four (79%) were cannulated for ECMO during CPR or within 6 hours of return of spontaneous circulation. Thirty-three (59%) survived to 12 months, 22 (41%) survived to 12 months with VABS-II decreased by ≤15 points from baseline, and of those with baseline VABS-II ≥70, 23 (51%) survived to 12 months with VABS-II ≥70. On multivariable analyses, use of ECMO, renal replacement therapy and higher maximum international normalized ratio were independently associated with lower 12-month survival with VABS-II ≥70.\n\nConclusions:: Approximately half of children survived with good neurobehavioral outcome one year after open-chest CPR for in-hospital cardiac arrest. Use of ECMO and post-arrest renal or hepatic dysfunction may be associated with worse neurobehavioral outcomes.",
