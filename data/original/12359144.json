  "abstract": "Collagen, the most abundant structural protein in the human body, plays a vital role in wound healing, tissue repair, and skin integrity. Collagen-based products—ranging from wound dressings, skin substitutes, dental and orthopedic scaffolds, to topical cosmetics and oral supplements—have proliferated rapidly across healthcare and consumer markets. Medical applications leverage collagen’s biocompatibility, biodegradability, and scaffold-forming properties to manage chronic wounds, burns, and bone defects, while emerging technologies such as recombinant collagen and phage-integrated dressings target future innovations. Topical collagen improves skin hydration but is unlikely to replace endogenous collagen; injectable fillers offer temporary cosmetic enhancement with some potential risks. Oral collagen supplements, although marketed for skin, joint, and hair health, primarily serve as incomplete proteins and require cautious interpretation, as rigorous clinical evidence supporting transformative outcomes remains limited. Specific formulations such as undenatured type II collagen show promise for inflammatory joint conditions by promoting immune tolerance. In wound care, collagen-based scaffolds enhance healing by supporting fibroblast proliferation, reducing inflammation, and modulating moisture balance, while novel crosslinked matrices and living skin equivalents push regenerative medicine boundaries. Not all collagen-based products are the same. As the global collagen market surges toward $18.7 billion by 2030, users must distinguish between marketing claims and evidence-based benefits of specific preparations. Proper product selection should be guided by clinical context, molecular source (animal, marine, recombinant), and intended use with awareness of underlying scientific evidence critical to therapeutic success. Continued innovation, rigorous validation, mechanism of action studies and rigorous clinical testing are essential to fully realize collagen’s therapeutic potential across medicine and wellness.",
