  "full_text": "1 Introduction\n\nDuring surgery, the measurement of end-tidal carbon dioxide concentration (EtCO 2 ) serves as a non-invasive method to estimate arterial carbon dioxide pressure (PaCO 2 ) ( 1 ), reflecting the amount of carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) dissolved in arterial blood. CO 2 can impact cellular mechanism such as cell movement, apoptosis, and cell growth ( 2 – 5 ). In vitro , elevated CO 2 levels may enhance the invasive capabilities of various cancer cells ( 6 – 9 ). In colon cancer cells, exposure to CO 2 exhibits in heightened proliferation, adhesion disorder and elevated levels of growth factor expression ( 7 , 10 ). Effects of CO 2 exposure on tumor biology have also been demonstrated in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma cells. Exposure to hypercapnia can result in increased cell colony formation, elevated cell division process, and higher radio- and chemotherapy resistance ( 11 , 12 ).\n\nDuring surgical procedures, EtCO 2 is influenced by mechanical ventilation and typically ranges from 30 to 45 mmHg ( 13 – 15 ). Currently, there are no recommendations for precise intraoperative target EtCO 2 levels derived from outcome studies ( 2 ). Intraoperative EtCO 2 levels are influenced by several factors, such as the presence of existing pulmonary conditions, the kind of surgery, and the anesthesiologist's preferences ( 2 ).\n\nIn our retrospective cohort study involving 528 patients undergoing colorectal cancer surgery, lower EtCO 2 values were associated with enhanced oncological outcome ( 16 ). Since in vitro experiments suggest that CO 2 may potentially affect the tumor biology of pancreatic cancer cells and because the impact of different intraoperative EtCO 2 values on oncological outcome in patients undergoing pancreatic cancer surgery is unknown, we performed this retrospective cohort study to examine the association between intraoperative EtCO 2 levels and recurrence-free survival.\n\n2 Methods\n\n2.1 Study design and cohort\n\nA retrospective cohort study was conducted involving patients who received general anesthesia for elective pancreatic cancer surgery at the Department of General, Visceral, and Transplant Surgery, Heidelberg University Hospital, Heidelberg, Germany.\n\nOur study protocol (S-723/2021) received approval by the local Ethics Committee of the Medical Faculty of Ruprecht-Karls-University, Heidelberg, Germany, on 29 March, 2022. The principles described in the Declaration of Helsinki and the STROBE guidelines for observational studies have been followed in preparing this report ( 17 ).\n\nWe evaluated the association between intraoperative EtCO 2 levels and recurrence-free survival following pancreatic cancer surgery. Patients who underwent pancreatic cancer surgery between 2009 and 2016 were analyzed. Only patients ≥18 years of age with a minimum of 180 days of follow-up data were eligible for inclusion. Patients with distant metastases at the time of surgery were not included in this study. Furthermore, the histopathological examination following elective pancreatic tumor surgery had to show either an R1 result (microscopic residual tumor) or an R0 result (no residual tumor) for inclusion. Exclusion criteria included identification of peritoneal carcinomatosis during surgery or cases where histological analysis could not verify the presence of cancer tissue, such as those following neoadjuvant chemotherapy or radiotherapy.\n\n2.2 Data collection\n\nData were accessed from patients' medical records and the prospectively-maintained electronic databases of the Department of Surgery at Heidelberg University Hospital. Data incorporated demographic information, American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status classification (ASA), body mass index (BMI), pre-existing conditions, neoadjuvant and adjuvant therapy, duration of surgery, intraoperative opioid usage and transfusions, performance of intraoperative radiation therapy (IORT), duration of hospital and intensive care unit stay, and outcome parameters. Resection margin status, tumor grade, and TNM (tumor, node, metastasis) classification were obtained from pathology findings. The mean EtCO 2 was determined using EtCO 2 values documented in the anesthesia records every quarter hour from intubation to extubation throughout the entire surgery. The EtCO 2 was measured in real-time using infrared spectroscopy in the “main stream” method. The documented EtCO 2 values correspond to the plateau values of the EtCO 2 curves displayed by the ventilator.\n\n2.3 Outcome analysis\n\nThe primary outcome measure was recurrence-free survival in the period from index surgery until the last known follow-up, with a median follow-up duration of 2.6 years (Q1:1.4; Q3:4.4). Recurrence-free survival was defined as the time from index surgery to the first documented event of local cancer recurrence, newly diagnosed metastases, or death. During the follow-up examinations, abdominal ultrasounds, computer tomographies, physical examinations and blood samples were carried out at regular intervals or when new suspicious symptoms occurred. If there were no documented instances of cancer recurrence, new metastases, or death, we recorded the date of the last follow-up or doctor-patient contact with negative findings. Surgical site infections (SSI), sepsis, reoperation due to surgical complications, and cardiovascular events (transitory ischemic attack, and cerebral- or myocardial infarction) during the hospital stay and overall survival were secondary outcomes.\n\n2.4 Statistical analysis\n\nThe entire patient cohort was sorted in ascending order based on mean intraoperative EtCO 2 values and then divided into two groups: the high-EtCO 2 group and the low-EtCO 2 group, each consisting of 326 patients. Descriptive analyses involved calculating the mean, standard deviation (SD), median, and first and third quartiles for continuous variables, and absolute and relative proportions for categorical variables. The chi-square test was employed to compare the distribution of categorical variables among the different groups, whereas differences in continuous variables were evaluated using the Mann-Whitney U test. Survival analysis for the predefined primary endpoint was performed using the Kaplan-Meier method ( 18 ), and group comparisons were made using the log-rank test ( 19 ). Bar charts were created for each year to compare the rates of a composite endpoint, including local cancer recurrence, newly diagnosed metastases, and death between the low and high EtCO 2 groups throughout the respective follow-up periods. To compare major differences in mean EtCO 2 values, the entire patient cohort was sorted by ascending mean intraoperative EtCO 2 values and then stratified into five groups for further survival analysis using the Kaplan-Meier method. Furthermore, a subgroup analysis was conducted to account for the duration of the respective EtCO 2 values. Therefore, patients were categorized into three subgroups according to their duration of surgery. The high and low EtCO 2 groups within these subgroups were subsequently re-evaluated for recurrence-free survival using Kaplan-Meier method. Thereafter, the primary outcome was analyzed by the Cox proportional hazard model ( 20 ), in which the effect of mean EtCO 2 on recurrence-free survival was estimated after adjusting for the following covariates: age, gender, BMI, diabetes mellitus, smoking, UICC (tumor classification according to the Union for International Cancer Control) stage, epidural anesthesia, intraoperative sufentanil consumption and transfusions, resection margin status, tumor grade, and neoadjuvant, intraoperative, and adjuvant therapies. Using the Wald-Test, p-values for regression coefficients were obtained. Hazard ratios (HRs) were calculated using Cox analysis and presented with their respective 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Significance was defined as a two-sided p-value < 0.05. Survival rates at 1–5 years were assessed using the Kaplan-Meier technique, and statistical significance was evaluated employing the log-rank test. Prism 9.0.0 (GraphPad Prism Software, Inc., San Diego, CA) and IBM SPSS Statistics 28.0 (SPSS, Chicago, IL) and were used for statistical analysis and graphical representation.\n\n3 Results\n\nAfter applying the inclusion and exclusion criteria, the final analysis comprised 652 patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma ( Figure 1 ).\n\n3.1 Patient characteristics\n\nTable 1 and Supplementary Table 1 contain the primary clinical and demographic baseline characteristics. At the time of surgery, the mean age was 63 ± 10 years. The average BMI was 25.2 kg m −2 and 48.3% of patients were female.\n\nThere were no disparities between high and low EtCO 2 levels in baseline characteristics or transfusion requirement. Furthermore, we noted no disparities concerning UICC stage, neoadjuvant therapy, resection margin and tumor grading status, or adjuvant therapy between groups. IORT was less prevalent in the high-EtCO 2 -group [8 (2.5%) vs. 21 (6.4%), high- vs. low-EtCO 2 , p = 0.014].\n\nGeneral anesthesia was performed as balanced anesthesia. In two participants (0.31%), fentanyl was administered as the intraoperative opioid, requiring the calculation of an equivalent dose to sufentanil ( 21 ). Epidural anesthesia was less prevalent in the high-EtCO 2 -group [230 (70.8%) vs. 258 (79.1%); high- vs. low-EtCO 2 , p = 0.014]. Intraoperative consumption of sufentanil was lower in the low-EtCO 2 -group (71.6 ± 34.7 vs. 76.7 ± 33.9; high vs. low-EtCO 2 , p = 0.014).\n\nSurgery was always performed as open surgery in this observed study cohort.\n\n3.2 Intraoperative EtCO 2\n\nAfter sorting the entire patient cohort in ascending order based on their mean intraoperative EtCO 2 values, they were divided into two groups: the high- and low-EtCO 2 groups, the determined cut-off value was 35.3 mmHg. The mean EtCO 2 in the high-EtCO 2 group was 36.8 mmHg ±1.9, compared to 33.8 mmHg ± 1.1 in the low-EtCO 2 group.\n\nAfter dividing the cohort into five groups, sorted according to the mean intraoperative EtCO 2 value, mean EtCO 2 values were 32.72 ± 0.97 mmHg, 34.26 ± 0.27 mmHg, 35.19 ± 0.26 mmHg, 36.09 ± 0.28 mmHg and 38.31 ± 2.45 mmHg, in ascending order.\n\n3.3 Survival analysis\n\nDuring the observation period, cancer recurrence was diagnosed in 493 patients (75.6%). Of these patients, 154 (31.2 %) had a local cancer recurrence, 298 (60.4 %) had distant metastases, and 32 patients (6.5 %) experienced both. Information regarding the nature of recurrence was not accessible for nine patients (1.8%). Throughout the observation period, 386 patients (59.2%) died. 373 patients (57.2%) succumbed to their cancer disease. Two patients (0.3%) passed away following a cardiovascular event. The reason for death was not available for 11 patients (1.7%). There was no difference in recurrence-free survival between the high and low-EtCO 2 groups [HR = 1.043 (95% CI: 0.875–1.243), log rank test: p = 0.909] ( Figure 2 ), nor did it differ among the groups when the patient cohort was divided into five groups [HR 1.011 (95% CI 0.950-1.075), log rank test: p = 0.917] ( Figure 3 ). Bar charts revealed no differences in the occurrence of the composite endpoint, including local cancer recurrence, newly diagnosed metastases, and death between the high and low EtCO 2 groups across the respective time periods ( Supplementary Figure 1 ). Likewise, the subgroup analysis for different durations of surgery did not reveal differences between the respective high and low EtCO 2 groups ( Supplementary Figure 2 ).\n\nFactors affecting the primary endpoint were studied via Cox analysis, which indicated no correlation between mean EtCO 2 levels and recurrence–free survival [Coefficient −0.004, HR = 0.996 (95% CI: 0.95–1.04); p = 0.871] ( Table 2 ). Variables that were associated with the primary endpoint included: BMI [Coefficient: −0.026, HR = 0.974 (95% CI: 0.950–0.999), p = 0.044], UICC stage IIb–III [Coefficient 0.402, HR = 0.669 (95% CI:0.523–0.855), p = 0.001], no grading due to adjuvant therapy [Coefficient: 0.421, HR = 0.656 (95% CI: 0.535–0.805), p < 0.001] and grading 3–4 [Coefficient 0.931; HR = 0.394 (95% CI: 0.201–0.774), p = 0.007].\n\n3.4 Secondary endpoints\n\n1-and 5-year survival rates did not differ between the high- and low-EtCO 2 groups (1-year survival: 87.9% vs. 86.4%, high- vs. low-EtCO 2 , p = 0.855; 5-year survival: 31.1% vs. 25.2 %, high- vs. low-EtCO 2 , p = 0.855) ( Table 3 ).\n\nThere were also no differences between the groups in terms of cardiovascular events, sepsis rate, surgical site infection rate or the rate of reoperations ( Table 4 ).\n\n4 Discussion\n\nIn this retrospective cohort study, we did not identify a correlation between intraoperative EtCO 2 and recurrence-free survival in patients undergoing pancreatic cancer surgery. This finding differs from our previous observation in other tumor entities ( 16 ), and it is in contrast our expectations that were based on in vitro studies ( 11 , 12 ). BMI, UICC stage IIb-III, no grade due to adjuvant therapy, and grade G3-4 were independently associated with recurrence-free survival. In our secondary endpoint analysis, overall survival, incidence of cardiovascular events, sepsis, SSI, and need for reoperation did not differ between the high- and low-EtCO 2 groups.\n\nThe correlation between EtCO 2 levels and oncological outcome in pancreatic cancer patients has not yet been investigated. CO 2 exerts diverse effects on tumor biology ( 2 , 8 – 10 ). Effects of CO 2 on mitochondrial metabolism ( 22 ), the cellular microenvironment ( 23 ), the expression of Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor ( 7 ), E-cadherin ( 7 ), and various matrix metalloproteinases ( 24 , 25 ), which are known to influence cancer cell invasion and metastasis ( 26 , 27 ), have been reported. Hypercapnic conditions in cervical cancer cells stimulate tumor cell proliferation. At the same time, hypercapnia led to a reduction in invasion, migration and adhesion ( 8 , 9 ). However, potential effects of hypocapnic conditions remain uncertain. Exposing colon cancer cells to CO 2 exhibits in heightened proliferation, adhesion disorder and elevated levels of growth factor expression ( 7 , 10 ). The effect of CO 2 on pancreatic cancer cells has rarely been studied. Nevler et al. exposed two pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma cell lines to normocapnic (5% CO 2 ) and hypercapnic (10% CO 2 ) conditions ( 11 ). Hypercapnia led to increased tumor proliferation, radio resistance, and chemoresistance ( 11 ). In the first retrospective cohort study of 528 colorectal cancer patients investigating the association between intraoperative EtCO 2 and oncological outcome, we demonstrated that lower EtCO 2 levels were independently associated with enhanced recurrence-free survival (HR = 1.138, 95% CI:1.02-1.28, p = 0.027) at a median follow-up of 3.8 with an interquartile range of 2.5 to 5.1 years ( 16 ). The hazard of cancer recurrence decreased by 12.1% with each 1 mmHg reduce in mean EtCO 2 ( 16 ). Surprisingly, in this study of patients who underwent pancreatic cancer surgery, EtCO 2 level was not associated with recurrence-free survival. In addition to the various CO 2 -related effects on tumor biology in different tumor types ( 2 , 8 – 10 , 28 ), the biological effects of hypercapnia on tumor development are also discussed as a function of time and CO 2 concentration ( 23 ). The EtCO 2 values only differed by approximately 10% (3 mmHG) between the high and low EtCO 2 groups. However, when patients were stratified into 5 groups, not even the extreme cases differed regarding recurrence-free survival.\n\nOur study also found no differences in 1- and 5-year survival rates between the high and low EtCO 2 groups. In contrast, in patients undergoing colorectal cancer surgery, both 1- and 5-year survival rates were higher in patients with lower EtCO 2 values ( 16 ). The type of cancer itself significantly influences the average survival time of a patient ( 29 – 31 ). Individuals with pancreatic cancer typically experience a shorter average survival time compared to those with colorectal cancer ( 29 – 31 ). Factors such as tumor grading, UICC stage, or resection margin status appear to have a stronger influence on recurrence-free survival than EtCO 2 in pancreatic cancer patients.\n\nCO 2 has been linked to multiple effects on the cardiovascular system. Hypocapnia can reduce the cerebral blood flow, impact the airway resistance, provoke cardiac arrythmias and trigger vasoconstrictions ( 15 , 32 , 33 ). Dony et al. demonstrated that hypocapnia, was linked to elevated 30-day postoperative mortality and extended hospitalization duration in patients undergoing non-cardiac surgery ( 32 ). In contrast, negative effects on the cardiovascular system due to hypercapnia have also been described. Increased blood CO 2 levels can elevate the heart's oxygen consumption, potentially resulting in tachycardia and hypertension ( 34 , 35 ). In this patient cohort, as well as in patients undergoing colorectal cancer surgery ( 16 ), intraoperative EtCO 2 did not affect the incidence of cardiovascular events or the length of hospital stay.\n\nMoreover, some authors suggest that hypercapnia has anti-inflammatory properties and improves tissue perfusion and oxygenation, potentially lowering the rate of SSI ( 34 , 36 – 38 ). In our study, no association was observed between EtCO 2 levels and SSI or the occurrence of sepsis. However, the incidence of sepsis and wound infections was low in this observed patient cohort.\n\nOur study has several limitations that warrant consideration. The presence of digital anesthesia records constrained the duration of observation period, thereby limiting the sample size. Due to the study design, the representativeness, validity, and reliability of the results are limited. Moreover, the study design lacks the ability to exercise complete control over unmeasured biases.\n\nThe selection process for EtCO 2 values lacked standardization, and the entire cohort was split into two equal groups based on the calculated mean EtCO 2 values. The mean for the low EtCO 2 group was in the mildly hypocapnic range, whereas the mean for the high EtCO 2 group was in the normocapnic range. Despite comparing the intraoperative EtCO 2 values by calculating individual mean values, we did not consider the individual dosages during surgery. The duration of EtCO 2 levels was considered only in a subgroup analysis with different operation durations and not continuously. Additionally, inspiratory CO 2 levels could not be considered. However, it is reasonable to assume that higher inspiratory CO 2 levels would also result in elevated EtCO 2 levels.\n\nBecause PaO 2 values are determined irregularly in contrast to the continuous non-invasive measurement of EtCO 2 , we refrained from exploring the correlation between PaO 2 and the measured EtCO 2 values.\n\nIn conclusion, we demonstrated, that intraoperative EtCO 2 during pancreatic cancer surgery is not associated with increased or decreased recurrence-free survival. EtCO 2 was not associated with the secondary endpoints, namely overall survival, cardiovascular events, SSI, incidence of sepsis, or reoperations. During elective pancreatic cancer surgery, anesthesiologists should set EtCO 2 targets for reasons other than oncological outcome until conclusive evidence from prospective, multicenter randomized controlled trials is available.",
