  "title": "Comparison of analgesic modalities after cesarean section: a network meta-analysis and systematic review",
  "abstract": "Background:: Cesarean section is one of the most common surgical procedures. Currently, there are many analgesic methods available after cesarean section, but the optimal analgesic method after cesarean section is not clear.\n\nMethods:: A network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials was used to search Embase, PubMed, Web of Science, and Cochrane databases. Outcomes included time to first postoperative request for analgesia, postoperative medication-supplemented analgesia, pain scores at four postoperative time points, postoperative complications (nausea and vomiting, itching, and level of sedation), and patient satisfaction.\n\nResult:: A total of 110 randomized controlled trials involving 8871 pregnant women were finally included. A total of 17 postoperative analgesic techniques for cesarean delivery were included. Compared with the control group, all modalities except wound infiltration prolonged the time to the first request for analgesia. Transversal abdominal block-type and lumbar quadratus block-type analgesia were effective in decreasing the need for opioids in postoperative patients. Wound infiltration and transversalis fascia plane decreased the need for nonopioid medications in postoperative patients. The traditional analgesic modalities of intrathecal morphine (IM) and epidural morphine have the best analgesic effect, and the analgesic effect of the type of transversal abdominal block and the type of lumbar square muscle block in local anesthesia is better than that of other local anesthesia modalities. The lateral transversus abdominis block and posterior and anterior lumbar square muscle block can effectively reduce postoperative complications with the best effect. In terms of patient satisfaction, IM with conventional Petit transverse abdominal block was the best.\n\nConclusions:: Regional nerve block is a safe and effective postoperative analgesic modality; QLB III, which is used to use opioids as postoperative supplemental analgesia, is the safest and most effective analgesic modality, and those who are used to use non-opioids as postoperative supplemental analgesia can choose transversalis fascia plane as a postoperative analgesic modality.",

A significant percentage of women have been reported to have moderate to severe pain [ 3 ] The pain after cesarean section is not only a problem. Pain after cesarean delivery not only affects the recovery process and daily life activities but also leads to anxiety and poor communication between the mother and the baby [ 4 ] . It also affects the mother’s psychological well-being, interferes with breastfeeding [ 5 ] , and increases the risk of persistent postoperative pain [ 6 ] .\n\nTherefore, the adoption of safe and effective postoperative analgesia can reduce patients’ unnecessary postoperative pain and injury response, which is conducive to the promotion of patients’ early recovery after surgery [ 7 ] . Different forms of postoperative analgesia commonly used in clinical practice include systemic drugs such as opioids and non-opioids such as steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and acetaminophen, neuraxial blocks, local anesthetic wound infiltration (WI), and regional nerve blocks [ 8 - 10 ] . There is no consensus on the best approach.\n\nSystemic pharmacological analgesia and neuraxial blockade are the traditional modalities of postoperative analgesia after cesarean section and are the most widely used in clinical practice, including long-acting intrathecal or epidural opioid analgesia, which is the gold standard for postoperative analgesia after cesarean section [ 11 ] . However, results have been mixed in clinical practice, with some studies showing superior analgesic effects of intrathecal morphine (IM) [ 12 - 14 ] , but some studies have not observed significant analgesic effects [ 15 - 17 ] , and pharmacologic analgesia may increase the risk of complications. With the continuous advancement of regional anesthesia techniques and injectable drugs, regional nerve block techniques have been shown to provide good analgesia, reduce the use of opioids, improve the quality of recovery, and shorten the length of hospital stay and have been used more frequently in clinical practice [ 18 - 20 ] . There are many types of regional nerve blocks, but there is no recognized optimal standard in clinical practice, and some studies have proven that all three anesthetic techniques, transverse abdominal plane block (TAP), WI, and lumbar quadratus block (QLB), are effective [ 21 - 23 ] .\n\nSeveral meta-analyses have been performed to compare analgesic modalities after cesarean section, but they have all compared two analgesic techniques or different accesses to the same analgesic technique [ 14 , 24 - 27 ] , and to date, there are no randomized controlled trials comparing systemic medications, neuraxial blockade, and regional nerve block analgesic techniques simultaneously. In addition, many interventions lack head-to-head randomized controlled trials, a situation that is difficult to handle with traditional two-arm meta-analysis evidence synthesis methods [ 28 ] . Network meta-analysis can handle data lacking direct comparison through indirect comparison [ 29 ] .\n\nThe aim of this paper is to comprehensively compare postoperative analgesia modalities after cesarean section through reticulated meta-analysis to find the best method for clinical medicine. Different interventions were evaluated according to five outcome indicators, including time to first postoperative request for analgesia, postoperative supplemental analgesia, postoperative analgesia score, postoperative complications, and patient satisfaction. Table 1 shows the interventions and their corresponding abbreviations mentioned in the article.\n\nMethods\n\nThis review was conducted in accordance with the PRISMA [ 30 ] (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) and AMSTAR [ 31 ] (Assessing Methodological Quality in Systematic Evaluations) guidelines. The risk ratio (RR), mean difference (MD), standardized mean difference (SMD) and the corresponding 95% CI were calculated separately. The search strategy and analysis plan for this systematic review and meta-analysis are registered with PROSPERO. The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) system was utilized to assess the certainty of the evidence using four levels (high, moderate, low, and very low) [ 32 ] . For the PRISMA checklist, see Supplemental Digital Content, Supplement 5, http://links.lww.com/JS9/E40 . For the Materials and methods, see Supplemental Digital Content, Supplement 2, http://links.lww.com/JS9/E36 .\n\nResults\n\nSearch results and characteristics of selected studies\n\nA total of 8292 articles were retrieved according to the search strategy, including 3883 articles in PubMed, 696 articles in Embase, 1921 articles in the Cochrane Library, 1792 articles in Web of Science, and 8 articles in manual search. One hundred and ten randomized controlled trials involving 8871 patients were finally included (Fig. 1 )[12-13,15-17,36-140]. Seventeen postoperative analgesic techniques for cesarean delivery were evaluated in these studies, with a total of 107 involving spinal anesthesia; 1 involving either spinal or epidural anesthesia; and 2 involving combined spinal and epidural anesthesia. One hundred and one were two-group studies, and 9 were three studies. The time span of the 110 included studies was 1998–2024. The basic characteristics of the included studies are listed in Table 2 .\n\nResult merging\n\nThe network diagram of all interventions included is shown in Figure 2 and Figure 3 shows the risk of bias evaluation of 110 randomized controlled trials.\n\nInconsistencies and certainty of evidence\n\nWe used the GRADE system to assess the certainty of the evidence (Table 3 ).\n\nPrimary outcome measures\n\nFor the primary outcome measures, the results of the two-by-two comparisons between different interventions are shown in Supplemental Digital Content, Supplementary Tables A2–A4, http://links.lww.com/JS9/E36 . Mesh, forest map, and under the probability curve comparison (SUCRA) sorting charts are shown in Supplemental Digital Content, Supplementary Figures A1 and A2, http://links.lww.com/JS9/E36 .\n\nSixty-one studies reported time to first request for analgesia postoperatively (h). Both IM and regional nerve block techniques reduced the time to first request for analgesia compared to controls, while WI was not significantly different from controls (MD = −0.72, 95% CI: −1.93 to 0.5). According to the cumulative area under the probability curve (SUCRA) comparison plot, the top five interventions were, in order, anterior quadratus lumborum block at the lateral supra-arcuate ligament (QLB-LSAL), posterior transversus abdominis block (P-TAP), erector spinae plane block (ESPB), QLB III, and transversus fasciae block (TFP). Of these, QLB-LSAL differed significantly from QLB III (MD = 4.20 95% CI: 0.01–8.38), and both were not significantly different from the other three interventions.\n\nSixty-five studies reported postoperative opioid supplemental analgesia, with QLB I, TFP, ilioinguinal-transversus abdominis plane (I-TAP), and rectus sheath block (RSB) not significantly different from controls (SMD = 0.12, 95% CI: −1.92 to 2.16; SMD = 1.32, 95% CI: −0.16 to 2.8; SMD = 0.59, 95% CI: −1.43 to 2.6; SMD = 0.45, 95% CI: −0.95 to 1.85, respectively). According to the cumulative area under the probability curve (SUCRA) comparison plot, the top five interventions were, in order, QLB-LSAL, Petit-TAP, EA, ilioinguinal and iliohypogastric nerve block (IIIH), and P-TAP. None of these five interventions differed significantly.\n\nTwenty-four studies reported postoperative nonopioid supplemental analgesia, with the WI, TFP, and controls differing significantly (SMD = 1.68, 95% CI: 0.05-3.32; SMD = 12.09, 95% CI: 6.89-17.29, respectively). TFP performed best according to the cumulative area under the probability curve (SUCRA) comparison plot.\n\nSecondary outcome measures\n\nFor the primary outcome measures, the results of the two-by-two comparisons between different interventions are shown in Supplemental Digital Content, Supplementary Tables A5–A17, http://links.lww.com/JS9/E36 . Mesh, forest map, and SCURA sorting charts are shown in Supplemental Digital Content, Supplementary Figures A3–A5, http://links.lww.com/JS9/E36 .\n\nFor postoperative movement analgesia scores, within 6 h after surgery, IM, QLB II, IIIH, ESPB, and EA were significantly different from the control group. According to the SUCRA comparison plot, the top six interventions were EA, QLB III, IM, ESPB, IIIH, and QLB II, in that order. Of these, EA was significantly different from the other five interventions (SMD = −1.32, 95% CI: −2.54 to −0.09; SMD = −1.36, 95% CI: −2.71 to −0.00; SMD = −1.62, 95% CI: −2.98 to −0.25; SMD = −1.95, 95% CI: −3.55 to −0.36; SMD = −2.07, 95% CI: −3.31 to −0.82, respectively); Within 12 h after surgery, P-TAP, QLB II, QLB III, QLB-LSAL, ESPB, and EA were significantly different from the control group, According to the SUCRA comparison plot, the top five interventions were EA, QLB III, QLB-LSAL, ESPB, and P-TAP, in that order. where EA was significantly different from the other four interventions (SMD = −3.04, 95% CI: −4.57 to −1.52; SMD = −2.82, 95% CI: −4.97 to −0.67. SMD = −3.38, 95% CI: −5.00 to −1.77; SMD = −3.48, 95% CI: −5.20 to −1.76, respectively); Within 24 h after surgery, WI, IM, QLB III, ESPB, and EA were significantly different from control, According to the SUCRA comparison plot, the top five interventions were, in order, ESPB, QLB III, QLB-LSAL, EA, and IM. These five treatment regimens were not significantly different from each other; Within 48 h after surgery, P-TAP, QLB I, ESPB, and EA were significantly different from the control group, According to the SUCRA comparison plot, the top four interventions were, in order, P-TAP, ESPB, EA, and IIIH. These four treatment options were not significantly different from each other. According to the SUCRA comparison plot, EA performed best in the movement analgesia score at 6 h and 12 h postoperatively, ESPB at 24 h postoperatively, and P-TAP at 48 h postoperatively.\n\nFor postoperative resting scores, within 6 h after surgery, IM, QLB II, QLB III, IIIH, and ESPB were significantly different from the control group (SMD = 1.54, 95% CI: 0.84–2.25; SMD = 0.85, 95% CI: 0.24–1.46; SMD = 1.27, 95% CI: 0.41–2.13; SMD = 1.08, 95% CI: 0.13–2.03; SMD = 1.48, 95% CI: 0.68–2.28, respectively). Within 12 h after surgery, QLB I and RSB were not significantly different from the control group (SMD = −0.11, 95% CI: −1.29 to 1.06; SMD = 0.57, 95% CI: −0.59 to 1.74, respectively). Within 24 h after surgery, IM, ESPB, and EA were significantly different from the control group (SMD = 0.60, 95% CI: 0.07–1.14; SMD = 0.97, 95% CI: 0.36–1.59; SMD = 1.95, 95% CI: 0.52–3.38, respectively); within 48 h after surgery, IIIH and ESPB were significantly different from the control group (SMD = −2.62, 95% CI: −4.21 to −1.03; SMD = 1.39, 95% CI: 0.19–2.58, respectively). According to the SUCRA comparison plot, IM performed best in the resting analgesia score at 6 h postoperatively; EA at 12 h and 24 h postoperatively; and ESPB at 48 h postoperatively.\n\nFor postoperative complications, lateral transversus abdominis block (L-TAP), Petit-TAP, QLB II, QLB III, ESPB, and TFP significantly reduced the rate of nausea and vomiting compared with the control group (RR = 1.56, 95% CI: 1.05–2.31; RR = 1.71, 95% CI: 1.02–2.85; RR = 2.41, 95% CI: 1.04–5.56; RR = 2.07, 95% CI: 1.07–3.99; RR = 2.62, 95% CI: 1.04–6.61; RR = 2.37, 95% CI: 1.06–5.33, respectively). L-TAP and Petit-TAP significantly reduced the rate of itching compared to control (RR = 0.65, 95% CI: 0.53–0.81; RR = 0.80, 95% CI: 0.64–1.00; RR = 0.48, 95% CI: 0.31–0.75, respectively). Petit-TAP, IIIH, and TFP were significantly different from controls (RR = 15.64, 95% CI: 2.06–119.00; RR = 15.21, 95% CI: 2.00–115.88; RR = 0.64, 95% CI: 0.44–0.93, respectively).\n\nFor postoperative satisfaction, IIIH, Petit-TAP, QLB II, and ESPB were significantly different from the control group (SMD = −4.74, 95% CI: −5.72 to −3.76; RR = 0.69, 95% CI: 0.53–0.91; RR = 0.73, 95% CI: 0.58–0.94; RR = 0.83, 95% CI: 0.69–0.98, respectively).\n\nDiscussion\n\nThis study involved 17 postoperative pain interventions and included 110 randomized controlled trials involving 8871 patients, analyzed in five areas: time to first request for analgesia, postoperative medication-supplemented analgesia, pain scores, postoperative complications, and postoperative patient satisfaction, which showed that WI was ineffective at first request for analgesia and reduced postoperative opioid versus nonopioid use, and that the 24-hour postoperative motor analgesia score was significant; IM and EA had the best combined performance on analgesia scores but were associated with complications; the self-controlled analgesia techniques (PCIA and PCEA) resulted in itching, vomiting, and other complications, and the regional nerve block technique was effective overall, but the RSB was ineffective for postoperative opioid supplementation and analgesia scores, with the QLB III had the best overall performance, including prolonging the time to first request for analgesia, reducing pain scores at 6, 12, and 24 hours, and reducing the risk of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV).\n\nWI provides postoperative analgesia by injecting anesthetics into the surgical wound site, which is simple and easy to perform [ 33 ] . Our results showed that WI was ineffective in the primary indicator of first request analgesia, and although it significantly reduced postoperative opioid and nonopioid supplementation, it was poor at reducing postoperative pain scores, and only significantly reduced 24-hour postoperative motor analgesia scores. 2021 Surgery-Specific Postoperative Pain Management (PROSPECT) recommends WI/infusion as a postoperative analgesic modality [ 9 ] . The PROSPECT 2021 recommended WI/infusion as a postoperative analgesic modality, and the PROSPECT 2023 states that WI analgesia has been enhanced [ 34 ] . The latest PROSPECT for 2023 states that the analgesic effect of WI is enhanced. However, several studies have shown that WI does not have a clear advantage over regional nerve block techniques [ 35 - 37 ] . However, some studies have shown that WI has no effect on uterine pain and mainly relieves superficial wound pain with no significant effect on visceral pain relief [ 38 ] . Patients developed wound hematoma after WI [ 39 ] , and the safety needs to be further investigated.\n\nPatient-controlled techniques (PCEA and PCIA) are systemic opioid analgesic techniques that utilize self-controlled analgesic pumps allowing patients to self-administer small doses of analgesic medication, which can provide better titration and improved responsiveness to analgesic needs [ 40 ] Elkassabany et al [ 41 ] showed that both PCEA and PCIA provide effective postoperative analgesia. It has been suggested that PCEA is superior to PCIA for postoperative analgesia, providing more effective pain relief than PCIA after abdominal surgery both at rest and when coughing [ 42 ] , but can also lead to side effects such as PONV, prolonged gastrointestinal obstruction, sedation, and dizziness [ 43 ] , which are consistent with our study.\n\nIntrathecal morphine and epidural morphine (EA) are the traditional analgesic modalities after cesarean delivery, and studies have shown that IM and EA injections allow hydrophilic morphine to easily reach the cerebrospinal fluid, which allows it to act rapidly on the central nervous system [ 44 ] . It has been shown that intrathecal (IM) and epidural (EA) administration of morphine allows hydrophilic morphine to easily reach the cerebrospinal fluid, allowing for a rapid effect on the central nervous system [ 45 , 46 ] . Our results show that IM is more effective after cesarean delivery than systemic opioid analgesia. Our results showed that in terms of postoperative analgesia scores, EA performed best in 6 and 12 h postoperative motor analgesia scores and 12 and 24 h postoperative resting analgesia scores; IM performed best in 6 h postoperative resting analgesia scores, and overall ranked higher in analgesia scores than other interventions, and all showed significant analgesic effects in the postoperative period, which is consistent with the results of the reticulation meta-analysis by Tao-ran Yang et al ’s [ 14 ] reticulation meta-analysis results. However, at the same time, in terms of complications, it can lead to an increase in PONV and itching rates. It has been shown that although morphine produces relatively superior analgesia, its adverse effects (e.g., nausea, vomiting, and respiratory depression) limit its application [ 47 ] . It has also been found that morphine can be detected in the breast milk of mothers using IM for analgesia, which may affect newborns [ 48 ] . In addition, pharmacologic analgesia may not always be indicated due to contraindications, such as in patients in whom neuraxial morphine is contraindicated, in patients with severe postoperative breakthrough pain, and in patients with renal impairment, and in such patients, the use of regional nerve block techniques is an excellent choice for the treatment of post-cesarean section pain [ 11 , 49 ] . Thus, in the clinical setting, the analgesic effects of opioids must be weighed against the potential for opioid-related side effects, such as nausea, vomiting, itching, and sedation, which may worsen recovery and increase the need for pharmacologic therapy [ 47 ] .\n\nThere is research evidence that regional nerve block techniques can provide good analgesia, reduce opioid use, improve quality of recovery, shorten hospital stays [ 18 , 19 , 50 ] , and is considered safe for breastfeeding women [ 51 ] . Commonly used regional nerve block techniques for postoperative analgesia after cesarean delivery include TAP, QLB, and IIIH [ 11 ] . In the cesarean delivery population, the TAP block is the most studied truncal nerve block. Surface anatomical labeling techniques have been replaced by ultrasound guidance. Ultrasound-guided TAP block improves needle placement accuracy [ 52 ] . With the advancement of ultrasound technology and local anesthesia, more and more surgeons have adopted ESB, RSB, and TFP for CS postoperative analgesia in recent years; after the maturation of ultrasound-guided technology, the access routes of QLB and TAP have been further subdivided. The latest procedure-specific postoperative pain management (PROSPECT) still recommends TAP block and QLB block as postoperative analgesia for cesarean delivery and adds ESPB as a local anesthetic technique for postoperative pain management [ 34 ] . The TAP block has been used as an analgesic for cesarean section. A recent meta-analysis evaluating TAP block versus QLB block demonstrated that QLB block is superior to TAP block in non-emergency cesarean postoperative pain management [ 26 ] . Results of a study evaluating TAPB, IIIH, QLB, TFP, ESPB, and WI suggest that TAP without IM is the most comprehensive local anesthesia technique for postoperative analgesia in CS [ 53 ] . The results of a study evaluating the assessment of TAP and IIIH showed that both have similar analgesic effects [ 24 ] . The results of a study evaluating TAP and IIIH showed that they have similar analgesic effects.\n\nOur analysis showed that all regional nerve block techniques were effective in prolonging the time to first request for analgesia and pain compared to the control group. QLB type(QLB I, QLB II, QLB III, QLB-LSAL), TAP type(L-TAP, P-TAP, Petit-TAP, I-TAP), ESPB, and TFP significantly prolonged the time to first request for analgesia in the postoperative period and outperformed the other interventions. QLB type and ESPB demonstrated superior efficacy in analgesia scores compared to other regional anesthesia techniques, and no significant differences were observed between QLB type and ESPB in postoperative pain scores, postoperative complications, or patient satisfaction. These findings align with previous studies by Priya et al [ 91 ] , Mostafa et al [ 90 ] , and Bakshi et al [ 81 ] . TAP type performed better than resting analgesia scores in terms of motor analgesia scores and was generally superior to other interventions in terms of satisfaction. Whereas scholars still have different opinions on the advantages and disadvantages of the two types of interventions, TAP type and ESPB, Boules [ 56 ] et al ; Malawat [ 57 ] et al ; Langoo [ 58 ] et al believe that ESPB is more effective than TAP class, while Kumar Reddy [ 59 ] et al concluded that there was no significant difference between the two interventions. ESPB was originally described by Foreo [ 60 ] et al for thoracic spinal analgesia at the T5 transverse process ESPB unilaterally provided extensive and effective analgesia. It was then popularized for use in cesarean section by scholars Hamed [ 61 ] et al , who popularized its use for postoperative analgesia after cesarean section, and there are fewer studies comparing it with other blocks, so further sufficiently robust studies are needed to confirm these findings. In addition, although IIIH reduced 6-h exercise and resting pain scores with higher satisfaction, it did not provide much benefit in prolonging the time to first request for analgesia; TFP was able to reduce PONV but did not show greater benefit in pain relief; RSB was significantly better than controls in prolonging the first request for analgesia and was not superior in any other metrics, and the results of a study comparing TAP versus RSB and the results of a study comparing TAP with RSB indicated that TAP was superior to RSB [ 62 ] .\n\nTAP was first proposed by Rafi et al in 2001 [ 63 ] , using a surface anatomical labeling technique that blocks nerve afferents between T6 and L1 in the abdominal wall, thereby reducing pain associated with abdominal incisions [ 63 , 64 ] . With the development of ultrasonography, in 2007, Hebbard et al [ 65 ] performed ultrasound-guided TAP for the first time with the aid of ultrasound equipment. Subsequently, the surface anatomical marking technique was gradually replaced by ultrasound-guided (anterior subcostal, lateral, and posterior) access [ 66 ] . The I-TAP nerve block was proposed by Staker et al . The QLB was introduced by Blanco in 2007 [ 19 ] , and later developed, QLB is now mainly categorized into lateral QLB (QLBI), posterior QLB (QLBII), and transmuscular/anterior QLB (QLBIII). Moreover, Guo et al [ 59 ] also proposed a novel QLB-LSAL block technique. Initially, the controlled study on TAP and QLB did not distinguish the access routes, and it was not until the study on the different access routes of TAP and QLB gradually matured that the advantages and disadvantages of the different access routes of TAP and QLB began to be investigated. Some scholars conducted a randomized controlled trial of bilateral TAP and QLBI, and the results showed that QLBI was superior to bilateral TAP. In the controlled study on the different access routes of TAP, there was evidence that compared with the lateral access, P-TAP was better in analgesic quality, and the quality of P-TAP was better in analgesia. P-TAP has a better quality of analgesia [ 68 ] . In a recent meta-analysis evaluating three different approaches to QLB blockade, QLB III was shown to be superior to the other approaches in the management of pain after non-emergency cesarean delivery [ 27 ] . The results of our study showed that TAP-type interventions were not as effective as QLB-type interventions in terms of pain scores, and for the different types of TAP blocks, P-TAPB was superior to the other TAP-type interventions in terms of time to first request for analgesia, opioid-supplemented analgesia, and pain scores; I-TAP was not superior to the control group in all outcomes. For the different types of QLB block, QLB-LSAL was significantly superior to QLB III in first request for analgesia, analgesia scores were not significantly different from QLB III, there are studies that suggest QLB-LSAL is superior to QLB III [ 67 ] , and there is a lack of studies directly comparing QLB-LSAL and controls, so the results of QLB-LSAL’s superiority over other interventions need to be further confirmed.\n\nFor postoperative opioid supplemental analgesia, our analysis showed that QLB type and TAP type were more effective in reducing postoperative opioids, with QLB-LSAL performing the best in postoperative opioid supplemental analgesia but was not significantly different from QLB III, so that collectively QLB III was the best choice as a supplemental medication for analgesia with opioids as postoperative supplemental medication. For postoperative nonopioid supplemental analgesia, TFP performed best in reducing postoperative nonopioid supplemental analgesia but did not stand out in other outcome measures.\n\nLimitations\n\nFirst, there may be bias in the group classification. When grouping TAP and QLB, although they were classified under the guidance of professional anesthesiologists, the grouping may be biased due to the succinctness of the description of the anesthetic process that may occur in the text. Second, some of the included studies were single-center studies with limited sample sizes, which may have reduced the reliability of the results and conclusions of these studies.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe current network meta-analysis indicates that regional nerve block is a safe and effective postoperative analgesia, QLB III, which is used to use opioids as postoperative supplemental analgesia, is the safest and most effective analgesia, and those who are used to use non-opioids as postoperative supplemental analgesia can choose TFP as postoperative analgesia, but TFP performs poorly in terms of its analgesic effect, so for the analgesic modality of using non-opioids as postoperative supplemental drug analgesia needs to be further explored.",
