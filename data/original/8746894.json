  "abstract": "Summary of Background Data:: NPWT is widely used in the management of complex wounds but high-level evidence of its resource use remains sparse.\n\nMethods:: The multicenter, multinational, randomized clinical SAWHI study enrolled a total of 539 consecutive, compliant adult patients with SAWHI after surgery without fascial dehiscence between August 2, 2011, and January 31, 2018. Patients were randomly assigned to NPWT and CWT stratified by study site and wound size using a centralized web-based tool. Evaluation of direct resource use comprised inpatient and outpatient time, personnel and material for wound treatment, and associated wound-related procedures. The resource use analysis was primarily based on the per protocol population (NPWT 157; CWT 174).\n\nResults:: Although treatment length within 42 days was significantly shorter in the NPWT arm {Mean [Standard deviation (SD)] NPWT 22.8 (13.4); CWT 30.6 (13.3); P < 0.001 U -test}, hospitalization time was shorter with CWT [Mean (SD) NPWT 13.9 (11.1); CWT 11.8 (10.8); P = 0.047 U -test]. Significantly more study participants were outpatient with CWT [N=167 (96.0%)] than with NPWT [N = 140 (89.2%) ( P = 0.017)]. Time for dressing changes per study participant [Mean (SD) (min) NPWT N = 133, 196 (221.1); CWT N = 152, 278 (208.2); P < .001 U -test] and for wound-related procedures [Mean (SD) (min) NPWT 167 (195); CWT 266 (313); P < 0.001 U -test] was significantly lower with NPWT.\n\nConclusions:: NPWT reduces resource use and maybe an efficient treatment alternative to CWT for SAWHI after surgery.",

The study protocol (Supplement) and the informed consent documents were approved by the lead ethical committee of the Witten/Herdecke University. The study was registered with the ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01528033 .\n\nParticipants\n\nAdult patients (age ≥18 years) with spontaneous wound dehiscence, reopened suture, or open wounds that could not be closed by primary intention after abdominal surgery were screened for study participation. A minimum wound size was required for correct application of the NPWT device, which was applicable for both treatment arms due to randomization. Inclusion, randomization, debridement or thorough wound cleansing, and treatment start were to be performed within 48 hours after diagnosis of the SAWHI. A nonclosable defect of the abdominal fascia was an exclusion criterion. Patients expected to be incompliant with the protocol and study-related requirements, or participating in another trial, which was thought to interfere with the study procedures, patient's compliance, wound healing, or targeted end points, were excluded. Patients were also excluded when receiving concomitant therapies or procedures deviating from the standard clinical wound care or had investigational character within 30 days before screening or with the need for concomitant therapies or procedures directly affecting wound healing. Pregnant women and patients with any pre-existing or ongoing organ system failure, which could not be stabilized or solved by appropriate medical treatment, with unremovable necrotic tissue present, with nonenteric and unexplored fistulas or malignancy of the wound were not allowed to participate. The use of any other NPWT device on the study wound within ≤8 days before screening was an exclusion criterion.\n\nThe initially defined wound size limitation was deleted because this was not in line with clinical practice and led to difficulties with patient inclusion.\n\nRandomization and Masking\n\nAfter providing written informed consent, patients were randomly allocated to NPWT or CWT in a 1:1 ratio using a computer-generated list created by the trial statistician located on a centralized web-based tool hosted by a professional information technology service. The randomization list consisted of permuted blocks of variable length, which were randomly arranged. Patients were stratified by study site and wound size (≤60 cm 3 and >60 cm 3 ). Each registered investigator received individual access to the tool without knowing the randomization sequence, which ensured allocation concealment. The investigators were responsible for adequately implementing the assigned therapy. Neither study participants, medical staff, nor resource use outcome assessors were blinded to the treatment assignment.\n\nProcedures\n\nAt baseline, patients received an extensive examination of the study wound, actual surgical history, and overall health status. After wound debridement or thorough wound cleansing, study treatment started either in-hospital or outpatient and was to be continued in outpatient care whenever possible.\n\nIn the intervention arm, commercially available CE-marked NPWT systems (V.A.C. Therapy, KCI, now part of 3M Company, San Antonio, TX) and consumables, were used at the discretion of the clinical investigator and according to manufacturer's instructions. Mainly reticulated open cell foam (ROCF, V.A.C. GRANUFOAM, KCI) dressings were used as indicated for dehisced wounds. Polyvinyl alcohol (V.A.C. WHITEFOAM, KCI) dressings were used for superficial and sensitive wounds. ROCF silver (V.A.C. GRANUFOAM SILVER, KCI) dressings were used for wounds with need for a barrier to bacterial penetration. NPWT as interim therapy was discontinued once the condition of a wound was suitable for closing, either by epithelialization or surgically.\n\nThe control therapy was CWT, which was any local wound treatment regularly used in the respective study site that did not have an experimental status or was NPWT. CWT was applied according to the hospitals’ local clinical standards and guidelines, based on the individual needs of the wound in the process of healing, and with special attention paid to exudate amount and local infection status.\n\nIn both treatment arms, wound-related procedures were performed when considered clinically necessary. Wounds were closed either surgically or by secondary intention. In the NPWT arm, secondary healing was achieved with CWT dressings after NPWT was discontinued.\n\nStudy visits were performed weekly until the end of maximum study treatment time at day 42. All study participants were followed until 132 days after randomization.\n\nQuality assurance of the data collection was ensured by 100% monitoring of the study data documented in the case report forms. Clinical research associates visited the study sites regularly with the frequency of visits adapted on the number of patients randomized per study site.\n\nOutcomes\n\nResource use parameters assessed included time, personnel (physician, nurse, nursing assistance, and relatives), and material. Evaluation of care and treatment periods included inpatient and outpatient treatment length, length of hospital stay, time to first discharge from hospital, and hospital readmissions. Time, personnel, and material required for dressings changes were documented within booklets for inpatient and outpatient care. Wound treatment material was placed in bags belonging solely to the patient treated. Each material entry was documented in the booklets with category, name, size, unit, and amount.\n\nWound-related procedures were documented with date of performance and time and human resources used. Surgical wound closure and wound closure by secondary intention were documented with number of study participants, location, anesthesia performed, time and human resources used, and associated procedures performed (wound cleansing and lavage, debridement, wound drainage application, and performance of secondary suture, skin graft or flap).\n\nIndirect resource use included the period of working disability, and mobility and leisure activities at baseline and at the end of the active study treatment period after 42 days or during the wound closure confirmation visit.\n\nIn addition to the clinical effectiveness analysis, the number of closed wounds within 132 days was determined. The criteria defined in the study protocol for complete, verified wound closure lasting at least 14 days were not applied. Any wound closure documented by the clinical investigator that did not conflict with another documented outcome was considered. Other than a priori planned, direct nonmedical resource use (transport; care and housekeeping services) was not assessed due to problems of the study participants to provide the information.\n\nStatistical Analysis\n\nAssuming a complete wound closure rate of 50% in the CWT arm and a minimum difference of 12.5% between the treatment arms after 42 days, 492 study participants were calculated to be necessary to achieve 80% power ( β = 0.2) with α = 0.05. 23 , 25 Due to 1 planned interim analysis after 250 participants completed 42 days, α was adjusted using the O’Brien-Fleming method ( α = 0.005 for the interim analysis and α = 0.048 for the final analysis), which led to a marginally increased sample size of 498 participants. 24 Interim results did not show the predefined positive effect at P less than 0.005 or a negative effect at a P less than 0.05 level for NPWT. The study was continued without sample size adjustment.\n\nResource use analysis was primarily based on the per protocol (PP) population representing study participants without treatment changes and with complete documentation, excluding patients violating inclusion and exclusion criteria, with unauthorized treatment changes, deviations from the recommended frequency of NPWT dressing changes, early treatment termination, or without valid documentation until wound closure confirmation or end of maximum treatment time. However, the results of the modified intention-to-treat (ITT) population including all randomized participants with a valid baseline and at least 1 post baseline wound assessment (Fig. 1 ) were analyzed secondarily, since this study population corresponds to real-life.\n\nResource use parameters are presented descriptively with mean and standard deviation, (minimum and maximum) per study participant or per treatment procedure as applicable. Statistical significance was determined using the Chi-squared or Mann-Whitney U test, respectively, with an alpha level of .05. SPSS statistical software, version 23 (IBM Inc, Armonk, NY), was used for all analyses.\n\nRESULTS\n\nBetween August 2, 2011, and January 31, 2018 539 patients were randomized in 34 study sites with the last patient follow-up visit on June 11, 2018. Recruitment was completed. 331 study participants were analyzed in the PP population. The patient flow according to Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT), including inpatient and outpatient care periods is provided in Figure 1 . Reasons for screening failures and exclusion from the ITT and the PP population were previously reported. 24\n\nDemographics and Baseline Characteristics\n\nDemographics and baseline characteristics of the PP population relevant for resource use analyses are provided in Table 1 and eTable 1 and 2 in the Supplement. Wound volume was slightly lower in the CWT arm. The mean number of comorbid diagnoses per study participant were the same in both treatment arms. More study participants with CWT had cardiovascular and endocrine/metabolic comorbidities at baseline. Details on the mandatory last and final wound pretreatment procedure performed before initiation of study treatment are provided in eTable 3 in the Supplement.\n\nInpatient and Outpatient Care and Treatment Periods\n\nIn the PP population, total treatment length within 42 days was significantly shorter in the NPWT arm (mean difference 7.8 days; P < 0.001), with the extended treatment in the CWT arm predominantly conducted during outpatient care (Table 2 ). Total outpatient treatment time was significantly shorter in the NPWT arm (mean difference 6.2 days; P = 0.017). Hospitalization time was 2.1 days shorter with CWT ( P = 0.047) (Table 3 ). In the CWT arm, 6.8% less study participants were treated exclusively inpatient and 4.2% more participants were discharged from hospital within 42 days, but in case of hospital discharge, time to discharge was only marginally longer in the NPWT arm (mean difference 0.9 days; P = 0.306). Overall, 6.8% more study participants with CWT than with NPWT were treated outpatient. Hospital readmissions were approximately the same in both treatment arms (difference 0.6%; P = 0.875). After day 42, 164 study participants [NPWT 60 (38.2%); CWT 104 (59.8%)] were still in care.\n\nMore information on treatment periods and care status is available in Table 2 , Table 3 , and Figure 1 . In study participants remaining with open wounds after 42 days, treatment was continued during follow up (eTable 4 in the Supplement).\n\nSurgical Wound Closure and Wound Closure by Secondary Intention\n\nWithin 42 days, surgical wound closure was performed in 103 of 331 (31.1%) study participants [NPWT 69 of 157 (44.0%); CWT 34 of 174 (19.5%)] (eTable 5 in the Supplement). In 66 of 331 (19.9%) participants [NPWT 31 of 157 (19.8%); CWT 35 of 174 (20.1%)] wounds were closed by secondary intention. Whereas surgical wound closure in the CWT arm was approximately evenly distributed between the inpatient and outpatient settings, the majority of surgical wound closure in the NPWT arm was performed in the hospital. Wound closure by secondary intention was predominantly achieved in the outpatient setting in both treatment arms. Additional information on the surgical wound closure procedure is provided with eTable 6 in the Supplement.\n\nPost Hoc Analysis of Wound Closures Within 132 Days\n\nIn the PP population, for a total of 288 of 331 (87.0%) study participants [NPWT 140 of 157 (89.2%); CWT 148 of 174 (85.1%)] a closed wound was documented within 132 days (Chi-squared test; P = 0.266) (eTable 7 in the Supplement). Time to this first wound closure documentation was significantly shorter in the NPWT arm [median 35 (95% confidence interval 29.2–40.8) days] than in the CWT arm [median 57 (95% confidence interval 46.6–67.4) days, P < 0.001].\n\nTime, Human Resources, and Material Required for Dressing Changes and Wound-related Procedures\n\nIn the NPWT arm, significantly fewer dressing changes were performed (mean difference 10.1) with a significantly lower time expenditure per study participant (mean difference 81.7 minutes) in total and in both care settings (Table 4 ). Physician contacts were significantly less frequent with NPWT (mean difference 2.7, P = .011) (eTable 8 in the Supplement). However, their time spent per study participant was nearly the same in the treatment arms (mean difference 3.4 minutes, P = 0.585). Nurse contacts and their total time expenditure were significantly lower with NPWT (mean difference 7.7, P < 0.001 and 69.1 minutes, P = 0.001, respectively). In both treatment arms, more dressing changes were performed outpatient than inpatient. CWT dressing changes following NPWT in case of wound closure by secondary healing, were mainly performed outpatient (eTable 9 in the Supplement).\n\nDressing material and wound dressings used during inpatient and outpatient care are listed in eTable 10 in the Supplement.\n\nSignificantly fewer wound-related procedures per study participant (mean difference 16.1, P < 0.001) with a correspondingly lower time expenditure (mean difference 99 minutes, P < 0.001) were performed in the NPWT arm (Table 5 ). The number of procedures involving nurses, assistant physicians, and specialist physicians was higher with CWT than with NPWT (eTable 11 in the Supplement). Time for nurses per study participant was significantly lower in the NPWT arm (mean difference 49 minutes, P = 0.038). Time expenditure for assistant and specialist physicians was not significantly different between the treatment arms.\n\nMore details on dressing changes and wound-related procedures with separate consideration of the post NPWT CWT period, and information on dressing material and wound dressings used during inpatient and outpatient care are provided in Table 4 , Table 5 , and in eTables 11–14 in the Supplement.\n\nIndirect Resource Use: Working Disability and Activities of Daily Living\n\nA total of 64 study participants with employment status available at the end of the active study treatment time were gainfully employed [NPWT 26/118 (22.0%); CWT 38/137 (27.7%)]. The duration of work disability was similar in both treatment arms (mean (standard deviation) [Min-Max] NPWT N = 24, 40.4 (5.6) [25–45]; CWT N = 31, 38.3 (10.5) [4–45]); P = 0.592; Mann-Whitney U -test).\n\nStudy participants were less mobile after 42 days than at baseline, and outdoor leisure activities and sports decreased (Table 6 ).\n\nEvaluating “Real-life” With the ITT Population\n\nIn the ITT population, due to treatment changes NPWT was also performed in some study participants in the CWT arm. Length of hospital stay was shorter in the CWT arm but, other than in the PP population, the difference between the treatment arms was not significant. All other care and treatment results show no relevant deviations from those in the PP population. Time and human resources used for dressing changes and wound-related procedures were similar to those the PP population. Further details on the results of the ITT population are provided in eTables 15–29 in the Supplement.\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nIn the SAWHI study, treatment length within 42 days was significantly shorter with NPWT than with CWT. This corresponds to the previously reported finding that NPWT was superior to conventional dressings in achieving complete closure. 24 Moreover, in the post hoc analysis on wound closure throughout the observation period, we showed that although the wound closure rate became more similar between the treatment arms within 132 days, the time to first wound closure documentation was significantly shorter in the NPWT arm.\n\nIntersectoral wound treatment was realized with the majority of study participants starting treatment in hospital and being discharged within 42 days. The assumed substantial number of resources used in outpatient facilities and home care, 9 was shown also to be applicable for patients with SAWHI after surgery. Length of hospital stay was 2 days shorter with CWT. Findings of studies with other indications which showed NPWT to shorten the hospitalization period, could not be confirmed for the specific patient group included in the SAWHI-study. 17 – 21 Significantly more study participants with CWT were treated as outpatients. Participants with NPWT were less often discharged and more often exclusively treated in hospital. If study participants were discharged from hospital, time to first discharge was similar with NPWT and CWT. Hospital readmissions were also equally represented in the treatment arms. More wounds were closed surgically than by secondary intention. Surgical wound closure was more common in the NPWT arm and was mainly performed during inpatient care, which could explain the longer hospital stay while the total treatment time was longer in the CWT arm. However, neither study participants, medical staff, nor resource utilization assessors were blinded to treatment assignment, which may have introduced bias in objective assessment, particularly in the clinical decision to discharge from the hospital with NPWT. Because the overall frequency of comorbidities was the same in both treatment arms and even more cardiovascular and metabolic/endocrine diagnoses occurred in the CWT arm, comorbidities at baseline can be excluded as a cause of prolonged hospitalization time with NPWT.\n\nIn both care settings, the number of dressing changes and the associated time consumption were significantly lower with NPWT. CWT dressing changes after NPWT to achieve wound closure by secondary intention, which by their nature are more frequent and require less effort than NPWT changes, made a relevant contribution to outpatient care.\n\nSignificantly more wound related procedures per study participant with a correspondingly higher time expenditure were necessary with CWT. Dressing changes and wound-related procedures required more personnel in the CWT arm with nurses being the major human resource used. The majority of resources were used in the outpatient sector, but a simple resource use-shift rather than decreasing the overall time consumption, because NPWT is thought to demand less frequent but more complex and time-consuming dressing changes than CWT, 10 could not be confirmed in this study.\n\nLimitations\n\nAs with the analysis of effectiveness and safety of the SAWHI study, the treatment and observation period of 42 days is also a limitation for the resource use analysis. We previously reported that more than 50% of the wounds were still open after 42 days. The small amount of data available before the start of the study severely limited the possibility of an adequate assessment of the required treatment and observation period to close the majority of the wounds. To address this, an additional post hoc analysis of wound closures within 132 days was performed that captured all wound closures regardless of whether they met the study protocol criteria for a complete, sustained, and verified wound closure or not. Nonetheless, the evaluation of resource utilization remains limited to 42 days and may require adjustment in further cost analyses.\n\nMaterial use was not sufficiently documented in the SAWHI trial. The planned analysis was not possible to be performed, but is limited to a simple listing of dressings used per treatment arm. Information on optimal material use for subsequent cost analyses may be derived from other resources.\n\nAnother limitation of this study is the lack of evaluation of intensive care unit days.\n\nNo formal cost analysis was performed which, if you think globally, is more of an opportunity than a limitation. The economic status of different countries is a major problem when analyzing disease state cost. 10 Unlike previous studies, which typically present country-specific unit costs for personnel, inpatient accommodations, and supplies based on the prevailing billing system, our study presents resource use results that can be used as the basis for any economic analysis worldwide.\n\nCountry-specific cost analyses from the perspective of the relevant actors in the respective health care system, incorporating other relevant data sources, are the next step in using the study data presented here.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nTo our knowledge, the SAWHI trial is the first RCT to report that NPWT reduces treatment time and results in less resource use for dressing changes and wound-related procedures for SAWHI after surgery. NPWT maybe an efficient treatment alternative to CWT, which needs to be demonstrated in a subsequent cost analysis.",
