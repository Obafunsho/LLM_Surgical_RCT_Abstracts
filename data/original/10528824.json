  "abstract": "Objectives: The utilization of optimal medical therapy (OMT) in patients with chronic limb threatening ischemia (CLTI) has not been well studied. BEST-CLI is an NIH-sponsored multi-center randomized controlled trial comparing revascularization strategies in CLTI patients. We evaluated the utilization of guideline-based OMT among patients with CLTI at the time of their enrollment into the trial.\n\nMethods: A multidisciplinary committee defined OMT criteria related to blood pressure and diabetic management, lipid-lowering and anti-platelet medication use, and smoking status for patients enrolled in BEST-CLI. Status reports indicating adherence to OMT were provided to participating sites at regular intervals. Baseline demographic characteristics, comorbid medical conditions, and utilization of OMT at trial entry were evaluated for all randomized patients. A linear regression model was used to identify the relationship of predictors to utilization of OMT.\n\nResults: At time of randomization (n=1830 total enrolled), 87% of patients in BEST-CLI had hypertension, 69% had diabetes, 73% had hyperlipidemia, and 35% were currently smoking. Adherence to 4 OMT components (controlled blood pressure, not currently smoking, use of one lipid-lowering medication, and use of an antiplatelet agent) was modest. Only 25% of patients met all 4 OMT criteria; 38% met 3, 24% met 2, 11% met only 1 and 2% met none. Age ≥80 years, coronary artery disease, diabetes, and Hispanic ethnicity were positively associated, while Black race was negatively associated, with utilization of OMT.\n\nConclusions: A significant proportion of patients in BEST-CLI did not meet OMT guideline-based recommendations at time of entry. This data suggests a persistent major gap in the medical management of patients with advanced peripheral atherosclerosis and CLTI. Changes in OMT adherence over the course of the trial and their impact on clinical outcomes and quality of life will be assessed in future analyses.",
