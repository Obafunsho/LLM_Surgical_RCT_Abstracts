  "title": "Clinical and cost outcomes of a polyethylene glycol (PEG)-coated patch versus drainage after axillary lymph node dissection in breast cancer: results from a multicentre randomized clinical trial",
  "abstract": "Background: The aim of this study was to compare the clinical outcomes between breast cancer patients who underwent axillary lymph node dissection with postoperative management using a polyethylene glycol-coated patch versus axillary drainage. The direct costs associated with both postoperative management strategies were also evaluated.\n\nMethods: This was a multicentre RCT in women with breast cancer who underwent axillary lymph node dissection (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT04487561 ). Patients were randomly assigned (1 : 1) to receive either drainage or a polyethylene glycol-coated patch as postoperative management. The primary endpoints were the need for an emergency department visit for any event related to the surgery and the rate of seroma development.\n\nResults: A total of 227 patients were included , 115 in the patch group (50.7 per cent) and 112 (29.4 per cent ) in the drainage group. The incidence of emergency department visits was significantly greater for patients with drainage versus a polyethylene glycol-coated patch (incidence rate difference 26.1 per cent, 95 per cent c.i. 14.5 to 37.7 per cent; P < 0.001). Conversely, the seroma rate was significantly higher in the polyethylene glycol-coated patch group (incidence rate difference 22.8 per cent, 95 per cent c.i. 6.7 to 38.9 per cent; P < 0.0055). Compared with drainage, using a polyethylene glycol-coated patch resulted in cost savings of €100.41 per patient. An incremental cost-effectiveness ratio analysis found that drainage was associated with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of €7594.4 for no need for hospital admission and €491.7 for no need for an emergency department visit.\n\nConclusion: Compared with patients who received drainage after axillary lymph node dissection, the use of a polyethylene glycol-coated patch resulted in a higher rate of seroma, but a lower number of postoperative outpatient or emergency department visits and thus a reduction in overall costs.",

  "full_text": "Introduction\n\nBreast cancer in women has surpassed lung cancer as the most common solid tumour in the world, with approximately 2.26 million new cases in 2020 1 , 2 . In Western Europe, its incidence and age-standardized mortality rates were 90.2 and 15.6 per 100 000 respectively 2 . Breast cancer represents a major public health challenge to national health systems. For instance, the mean total costs over a 5-year interval for breast cancer care in Spain were €160 642 per patient 3 .\n\nThe introduction of novel targeted therapies has changed the treatment landscape, but surgery remains the most common treatment for breast cancer 3–5 . A greater number of breast cancer patients are, however, diagnosed with early-stage disease 2 , and thus surgical treatment has become progressively less invasive 4 , 5 .\n\nAlthough axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) remains important for staging and locoregional control 6 , this procedure has been progressively replaced by the less invasive sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB). SNLB has led to a lower incidence of postoperative complications, with less effects on quality of life and delays of adjuvant treatment initiation 7 , 8 . SLNB is the main tool for assessing nodal involvement in breast cancer patients, particularly for patients where radiological examination fails and/or with a clinically negative nodal status 9 .\n\nTherefore, the current trend is to favour, whenever possible, a conservative surgical approach to the axilla 4 , 5 , 7 , 8 . The optimal management of the axilla remains a subject of debate 10 , as there are clinical situations when ALND is still indicated 8 . Importantly, ALND provides accurate prognostic information that is crucial for achieving better clinical outcomes and greater survival rates, particularly in those patients with axillary disease 11 .\n\nALND is, however, associated with increased morbidity and adverse events, such as lymphoedema, haematoma, decreased range of shoulder movement, and seroma 11 , 12 . Seroma is the most prevalent complication of breast cancer surgery, affecting between 15 and 81 per cent of patients after lymph node dissection 11 , 13–15 .\n\nDrain placement is common after ALND, and, while not a complication, a prolonged need for a drain can increase the incidence of other postoperative complications, such as infections, delayed wound healing, and a delay in initiation of adjuvant treatment 16 , 17 .\n\nTherefore, it is important to identify effective alternatives to drains that can reduce the incidence of complications and improve recovery before adjuvant treatment.\n\nOne alternative to drain placement is a polyethylene glycol (PEG)-coated patch (Hemopatch™, Sealing Hemostat, Baxter AG, Vienna, Austria) that has been associated with promising outcomes in a variety of surgical procedures 18 , 19 .\n\nBecause national health systems face unlimited demand, with limited resources, the identification of interventions that reduce the costs associated with the postoperative management of patients is important. Several studies have analysed the overall cost of breast cancer treatment 3 , the cost of imaging, such as MRI 20 , and the economics of ambulatory breast cancer surgery 21 .\n\nThe Spanish REDHEMOPACH network was established as a platform for the study of breast cancer treatment. Its main objectives were to collect clinical characteristics, intraoperative variables, and postoperative management strategies of patients undergoing ALND. An interim analysis of the REDHEMOPACH database revealed that the use of a PEG-coated patch was associated with improved postoperative management, as measured by a lower number of postoperative outpatient and emergency department (ED) visits. Its use did not reduce the incidence rate of seroma 22 .\n\nThe aim of this study was to compare the clinical outcomes between breast cancer patients who received axillary drainage with those who received a PEG-coated patch after ALND. Direct costs associated with each postoperative management strategy were also evaluated.\n\nMethods\n\nStudy design and participants\n\nThis was a multicentre, parallel RCT conducted in women with breast cancer who underwent ALND between 31 July 2019 and 15 July 2022.\n\nThe study protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee of the University Clinical Hospital of Valencia (register number: REDHEMOPACH V.6; 29 July 2020) and was registered in ClinicalTrials.gov (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT04487561 ). The study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and all the study participants provided written informed consent before starting the study. A detailed study protocol has been published elsewhere 16 .\n\nInclusion/exclusion criteria\n\nWomen who were aged greater than or equal to 18 years and diagnosed with breast cancer, who were scheduled for surgical treatment by breast conservative surgery and ALND, and who were willing to comply with the investigators and protocol indications were included in the study.\n\nPatients that were SLNB-negative, subsidiary mastectomy patients, and those who did not sign informed consent for axillary lymphadenectomy were excluded.\n\nStudy groups\n\nDetailed information about the study protocol and procedures has been published elsewhere 22 . Patients were randomly assigned (1 : 1) to one of two study groups. In the patch group, before surgical closure of the axillary incision, a PEG-coated patch was placed. In the drainage group, a 12G (Needle gauge [G]) redon suction-drain tube was placed in the surgical wound before closure of the axillary incision.\n\nDirect costs\n\nA cost analysis was carried out from the perspective of the regional health systems involved in the study. Healthcare system costs were obtained for each regional health system. The median value of the costs was used in the analysis, as there were differences in costs between regional health system sites.\n\nThe cost-effectiveness ratio (CER) was calculated as a cost per outcome formula. CER was calculated once by considering the numerical difference in outcomes.\n\nThe incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was calculated as the numerical difference in outcomes between early-switch and late-switch groups, using the following formula: ICER = (costs in patch group − costs in drainage group)/(effectiveness in patch group − effectiveness in drainage group).\n\nOutcomes\n\nThe primary endpoints in this study were the need for an ED visit for the postoperative management of any event related to the surgery and the incidence rate of seroma.\n\nSecondary endpoints included total seroma volume and the incidence of adverse events.\n\nA combined secondary objective was also selected that considered both the incidence of seroma and the need for an ED visit. According to these criteria, the following assumptions were made: complete success was defined as patients in which the presence of seroma was not evident and there was no need for an ED visit; partial success was defined as patients that had evidence of seroma, but did not require an ED visit; and failure was defined as patients with seroma where an ED visit was required. Patients who visited the ED for any reason related to surgery, even if no seroma was present, were also considered failures.\n\nDefinitions\n\nSeroma was defined as a palpable, uninfected, clear fluid collection (greater than or equal to 20 ml) under the wound, in the dead space of the axilla. BMI was stratified into normal weight (defined as BMI less than 25 kg/m 2 ), overweight (defined as BMI greater than or equal to 25 kg/m 2 to less than 30 kg/m 2 ), and obese (defined as BMI greater than or equal to 30 kg/m 2 ) 22 .\n\nStatistical analysis\n\nA standard statistical analysis was performed using MedCalc ® Statistical Software version 20.116 (MedCalc Software Ltd, Ostend, Belgium; https://www.medcalc.org ; 2022).\n\nFor sample size calculation, a difference in the incidence of seroma of 18 per cent was considered significant (using a two-tailed test). With an α of 0.05 and a power of 80 per cent, 111 patients per group were required. Based on previous experience (E Buch-Villa; E Muñoz- Sorsona; M Adrianzen; V López-Flor; J Ortega) the incidence rate of seroma in the patch group would be 29 per cent and according to a Cochrane Database systematic review 23 the incidence rate of seroma in conservative surgery with drainage would be 47 per cent.\n\nDescriptive statistics (number (percentage), mean(s.d.), mean (95 per cent c.i.), mean(s.e.), median (interquartile range (i.q.r.)), or median (95 per cent c.i.)) were used, as appropriate.\n\nData were tested for normal distribution using a Shapiro–Wilk test.\n\nThe two-tailed unpaired Student’s t test or the Mann–Whitney U test was used, as appropriate, to compare means between treatment groups for quantitative variables.\n\nA logistic regression model was used to estimate and test factors for their association with seroma incidence and the need for an ED visit. A backward strategy was adopted, with a statistically significant cut-off for variable screening of ≤0.05. Factors associated with progression in the univariable analysis at P ≤ 0.1 were included in the multivariable analysis.\n\nRegarding the role of obesity, two different analyses were carried out. In the first analysis, groups were divided into normal weight (BMI less than 25 kg/m 2 ), overweight (BMI greater than or equal to 25 kg/m 2 to less than 30 kg/m 2 ), and obese (BMI greater than or equal to 30 kg/m 2 ). In the second analysis, groups were stratified into non-obese (BMI less than 30 kg/m 2 ) and obese (BMI greater than or equal to 30 kg/m 2 ).\n\nCategorical variables were compared using the chi-squared test and Fisher’s exact test, as required. P < 0.05 was considered significant.\n\nResults\n\nA total of 227 patients were included in the study, 115 (50.7 per cent) patients in the patch group and 112 (49.4 per cent) patients in the drain group.\n\nPreoperative demographic and clinical characteristics\n\nTable 1 shows the main baseline demographic and clinical characteristics of the study population. Except for BMI, in which significant differences between groups were observed, no other significant differences were detected in any of the variables analysed.\n\nSurgical procedure\n\nNo differences were observed between groups with respect to characteristics of the surgical procedure ( Table 2 ). The median number of patches used during the procedure was 1.0 (i.q.r. 1.0–2.0) patches, with 84 patients undergoing surgery with only a single patch.\n\nClinical outcomes\n\nTable 3 summarizes the main clinical outcomes of the study. The incidence rate of ED visits was significantly greater in the drainage group (incidence rate 33.0 per cent, 95 per cent c.i. 26.1 to 51.0 per cent) than in the patch group (incidence rate 7.0 per cent, 95 per cent c.i. 3.5 to 15.8 per cent), with an incidence rate difference of 26.1 per cent (95 per cent c.i. 14.5 to 37.7 per cent; P < 0.0001). In the drainage group, the most frequent reason for attending the ED was problems related to the redon drain itself, followed by seroma. In the patch group, the most frequent reason was seroma.\n\nIn contrast, the rate of seroma was significantly higher in the patch group (incidence rate 49.6 per cent, 95 per cent c.i. 37.5 to 64.2 per cent) than in the drainage group (incidence rate 26.8 per cent, 95 per cent c.i. 18.1 to 38.2 per cent), with an incidence rate difference of 22.8 per cent (95 per cent c.i. 6.7 to 38.9 per cent; P < 0.006).\n\nThe time to first seroma puncture from surgery was significantly longer in the patch group than the drainage group (Hodges–Lehmann median difference 3.0 days, 95 per cent c.i. 0 to 5.0 days; P = 0.025).\n\nIn the drainage group, the mean(s.d.) number of days with drainage was 9.4(5.6) days. Patients in the drainage group required a significantly greater number of outpatient visits for seroma control than those in the patch group (Hodges–Lehmann median difference 2.0 visits, 95 per cent c.i. 1.0 to 2.0 visits; P < 0.001).\n\nThe overall predefined success rate was significantly greater in the patch group than in the drainage group, although this difference was mainly due to the rate of partial success.\n\nFactors associated with the need for an emergency department visit and seroma incidence\n\nFactors significantly associated with the need for an ED visit in the univariable analysis were the presence of diabetes mellitus, previous axillary surgery, and study group assignment ( Table 4 ). In the univariable analysis, factors significantly associated with seroma incidence included study group assignment, age greater than 56 years, and the presence of preoperative co-morbidities ( Table 4 ).\n\nIn the multivariable analysis, after adjusting for relevant factors, previous axillary surgery increased the probability of an ED visit by 4.8-fold, whereas assignment to the patch group significantly reduced the probability of an ED visit by 87 per cent. The patch group assignment increased the OR for seroma by 3.3-fold ( Table 4 ).\n\nCosts and cost-effectiveness\n\nCompared with drainage, the use of a PEG-coated patch resulted in cost savings of €100.41 per patient ( Table 5 ).\n\nThe CER of no need for an ED visit was €292.4 in the patch group and €605.6 in the drainage group. Similarly, the CER of no need for hospital admission and success of treatment were lower in the patch group (€284.8 and €308.9 respectively) than in the drainage group (€429.2 and €629.1 respectively) ( Table 5 ).\n\nDrainage was associated with an ICER of €7594.4 for no need for hospital admission, €491.7 for no need for an ED visit, and €542.5 for achieving treatment success ( Table 5 ).\n\nDiscussion\n\nAlthough breast cancer surgery is associated with low rates of surgical morbidity, it is not free of adverse events 24 , and a common consequence of ALND is seroma. The incidence of seroma has been shown to be 30 per cent after an ALND, with even higher rates after adjuvant irradiation 13–15 , 25 , 26 . Different strategies focused on preventing and/or reducing the incidence of seroma have been previously assessed 16 , 17 , 23 , 27–30 . There is an increasing focus on post-surgical morbidity, as more patients survive breast cancer with the available therapies. Thus, the postoperative management of patients with breast cancer is a very important aspect of surgery 24 .\n\nThe current study found that 45 (20.3 per cent) patients required an ED visit, with a significantly greater proportion seen in the drainage group compared with the patch group (incidence rate difference 26.1 per cent, 95 per cent c.i. 14.5 to 37.7 per cent; P < 0.0001). Additionally, the overall incidence of seroma was 38.3 per cent (87/227), with a significantly greater incidence in the patch group versus the drainage group (incidence rate difference 22.8 per cent, 95 per cent c.i. 6.7 to 38.9 per cent; P < 0.0055).\n\nExcept for preliminary results recently published by the authors in 2022 22 , to the authors’ knowledge, this is the first multicentre RCT evaluating the effect of a PEG-coated patch on reducing the incidence of seroma and other complications related to the postoperative management of breast cancer patients undergoing ALND.\n\nThere are no conclusive results that support the use of sealants to prevent the appearance of seroma after ALND. The different types of patients included in relevant studies, in addition to the differences in their surgical protocols, make it extremely difficult to make conclusions 18 , 31 , 32 .\n\nAlthough the incidence of seroma was greater in the patch group, the time between surgery and the first seroma puncture was significantly shorter in the drainage group (Hodges–Lehmann median difference −3.0 days, 95 per cent c.i. −5.0 to −0.0 days; P = 0.025). This may suggest that instances of seroma in the drainage group, although less frequent, were more difficult to manage. In support of this hypothesis is the fact that patients in the drainage group required a significantly greater number of outpatient visits to control the seroma than those in the patch group ( P < 0.001).\n\nIn the multivariable analysis, previous axillary surgery was associated with a greater need for an ED visit ( P = 0.0122), and the use of a PEG-coated patch was associated with a lower probability of an ED visit ( P < 0.001). On the other hand, the patch group exhibited a greater incidence of seroma in the multivariable analysis ( P <0.001).\n\nObese patients are at increased risk of postoperative complications 33 . Additionally, increased body weight 18 , 34 and BMI 31 , 35–37 have both been associated with increased seroma formation. In the current study, obesity was, however, not significantly associated with either the incidence of seroma or the need for an ED visit.\n\nPublic health services must cope with an unlimited demand for limited resources. Therefore, it is extremely important to identify cost-effective treatments. In the current study, although the incidence of seroma was greater in the patch group, their postoperative management appeared to be smoother. Cost and cost-effectiveness analyses support this assumption, as a PEG-coated patch resulted in a total mean cost savings of €100.41 per patient. Additionally, the use of drainage was associated with an ICER of €491.7, €7594.4, and €542.5 for no need for an ED visit, no need for hospital admission, and for achieving treatment success respectively.\n\nThis study has limitations that should be taken into consideration. Although this was a multicentre study, many patients were recruited in the Valencian community, and therefore the limited geographical distribution of the sample may limit the generalizability of the results, especially in terms of costs. The study protocol did not provide indications or collect information about the person responsible for the postoperative management of patients with drainage (either patient caregiver or nurse). This point was managed according to the specific protocols of each study centre. Additionally, this study did not evaluate direct non-medical costs (that is home healthcare and social services), patient transportation costs, or other incidental costs when establishing economic parameters. In view of the results, the inclusion of such costs would likely make the difference even more favourable with regard to the use of patches. Finally, this study has only considered direct costs associated with postoperative management. Therefore, the results of this analysis do not reflect the total costs of ALND. In patients who underwent axillary lymphadenectomy, a PEG-coated patch was associated with a lower number of postoperative outpatient visits and a lower number of ED visits, resulting in a reduction in costs. Although the incidence of seroma was significantly greater in patients who received the patch compared with those who received drainage, their postoperative management appeared to be smoother.\n\nThe clinical and economic value of using a PEG-coated patch in clinical practice, although promising, needs to be confirmed in future studies.",
