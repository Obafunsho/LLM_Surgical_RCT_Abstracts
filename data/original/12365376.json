Extracellular vesicles (EVs) have emerged as promising candidates for treating various intractable diseases. This review explores the therapeutic potential of engineered EVs in joint diseases, particularly in comparison to their parental stem cells. Recent research underscores the efficacy of EVs in treating joint diseases, especially Osteoarthritis (OA). We discuss EV engineering strategies aimed at overcoming the limitations of natural EVs. Data from preclinical trials, clinical studies, and in vitro and in vivo reports are analyzed to evaluate the effectiveness of EVs in treating joint conditions. In addition to their role in intercellular communication, EVs influence various biological processes crucial for bone remodeling, cartilage regeneration, immunomodulation, and inflammation control.

OA primarily targets joint cartilage, resulting in stiffness, pain, and swelling in the affected areas, and is a leading cause of disability and reduced quality of life (Jang et al. 2021 ). Various forms of arthritis affect adults and children, encompassing a broad spectrum of joint‐related conditions (Nigrovic et al. 2018 ). Some arthritic diseases display overlapping features, typically classified into five main categories: inflammatory arthritis, non‐inflammatory arthritis, metabolic arthritis, connective tissue diseases with arthritic manifestations, and other joint pain‐related disorders (Diana Esquivel and Srivastava 2024 ). These classifications are summarized in Figure 1 . As previously reviewed, OA demonstrates considerable clinical and physiological heterogeneity, which has informed the identification and classification of its subtypes. Classification criteria include the mechanism of onset, affected tissues and joints, disease progression stage, presence of joint effusion, levels of inflammation, degree of chronic pain, and mechanical stress (Dell'Isola et al. 2016 ; Driban et al. 2010 ). Based on these factors, OA can be subtyped into generalized OA (e.g., nodal arthropathy), bilateral OA, monoarticular OA, and site‐specific OA presentations (Driban et al. 2010 ; Felson 2010 ). Notably, studies have reported a 20% overlap among knee OA subgroups previously categorized by risk factors, designating this subgroup as “complex knee OA” (Dell'Isola and Steultjens 2018 ). Furthermore, a significant correlation has been observed between OA severity, as classified by the Kellgren‐Lawrence grading system, and patient‐reported outcomes measured by the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index (WOMAC) (Karsdal et al. 2015 ).\n\nOA affects over 500 million people worldwide, with more than 260 million suffering from knee OA (Hunter et al. 2020 ). This prevalence results in significant socioeconomic burdens and high disability rates, exacerbated by limited access to disease‐modifying therapies and diagnostics (Mahmoudian et al. 2021 ). Common therapeutic options for OA include non‐surgical approaches, such as non‐steroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and surgical interventions like joint replacement. However, neither strategy effectively reduces the incidence of early‐stage OA; both present significant challenges for clinicians. Thus, these treatments often lead to significant economic burdens for patients and can result in serious consequences (Mora et al. 2018 ). The current therapeutic interventions, such as NSAIDs, offer only temporary relief and fail to halt the disease progression (Quicke et al. 2022 ).\n\nStem cell‐based therapy represents a promising avenue for OA treatment, potentially enabling cartilage regeneration (Jung et al. 2024 ; Vega et al. 2015 ). Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are adult stem cells characterized by their robust self‐renewal potential and ability to differentiate into multiple lineages. Numerous studies currently focus on the potential utilization of three main types of MSCs in treating OA (Colombini et al. 2019 ): adipose‐derived MSCs (ADMSCs) (Fodor and Paulseth 2015 ; Jo et al. 2014 ; Koh and Choi 2012 ; Koh et al. 2016 ), umbilical cord MSCs (UCMSCs) (Dhillon et al. 2022 ; Liang, Suo, et al. 2020 ), and bone marrow MSCs (BM‐MSCs) (Wakitani et al. 2002 ; Zhou and Shi 2023 ). Additionally, less common sources of MSCs, such as peripheral blood stem cells (Saw et al. 2013 ) and infrapatellar fat pad (IFP)‐derived MSCs (Greif et al. 2020 ), have also demonstrated promising therapeutic potential in treating arthritis. MSCs exhibit paracrine actions that could revolutionize OA treatment, offering benefits such as antiapoptotic, angiogenic, support for immunomodulation, chemoattraction, anti‐scarring, and the proliferation and differentiation of stem cells and progenitor cells (Kong et al. 2017 ). MSC‐mediated OA therapy promotes the regeneration of chondrocytes and synoviocytes, inhibiting extracellular matrix degradation, attenuating the inflammatory microenvironment induced by macrophages, and alleviating pain (Tian et al. 2024 ). While MSCs hold significant therapeutic promise, they are not without risks, such as immune rejection and tumorigenicity (Ankrum et al. 2014 ; Lee et al. 2013 ).\n\nDespite a wide range of therapeutic options available, including medications, surgery, and cell therapy, the outcomes have often fallen short of expectations (Steinert et al. 2007 ). In contrast, MSCs‐derived EVs have evolved into a feasible alternative in the treatment of OA (Karoichan et al. 2024 ; Zhang, Qin, et al. 2022 ). EVs facilitate intercellular communication and serve as functional paracrine factors for stem cells and nucleic acids. They can cross biological barriers and pose fewer ethical concerns compared to MSCs (Jeyaraman et al. 2022 ). Increasing evidence supports the essential impact of EVs in the diagnosis, pathogenesis, and therapy of OA. They play a key role in maintaining cellular homeostasis by regulating apoptosis and modulating oxidative stress, inflammation, and cell proliferation (Kim et al. 2020 ; Liu, Zhuang, et al. 2023 ). Comprising a nano‐sized lipid bilayer membrane, EVs carry biomolecules, including nucleic acids, proteins, lipids, and metabolites, that are delivered to adjacent or distant cells within the extracellular space (Saadeldin, Ehab, and Cho 2023 ; Yu et al. 2023 ; Zhang, Liu, et al. 2019 ). EVs cargo proteins and miRNAs are biomarkers for temporomandibular joint OA (Miyaki 2018 ; Wang, Tuerxun, et al. 2023 ). Reactive oxygen species (ROS) have been shown to play a critical role in regulating EV release, with EVs exhibiting potent oxidant–antioxidant activity through multiple pathways across various disease contexts (Abdal Dayem et al. 2024 ). The potential of stem cell‐derived EVs in treating degenerative diseases by regenerating chondrocytes and mitigating OA is reported (Hsueh et al. 2023 ; Toh et al. 2017 ). Additionally, their anti‐inflammatory effects and ability to modulate gene expression post‐transcriptionally via miRNAs are proving invaluable in developing new therapies for OA and other inflammatory diseases (Morente‐Lopez et al. 2022 ).\n\nBM‐MSC‐EVs exhibit significant potential in cartilage regeneration in OA disease (Jose Alcaraz 2024 ), which is the main therapeutic target of BM‐MSCs. BM‐MSC‐EVs counteract the deleterious effects of inflammatory mediators on cartilage homeostasis. The co‐culture of BM‐MSC‐EVs with OA chondrocytes led to abolishing the TNF‐alpha‐induced increased COX2 and interleukins and inhibiting TNF‐alpha‐induced collagenase activity. BM‐MSC‐EVs were added to chondrocyte cultures derived from individuals with OA to promote the production of type II collagen and proteoglycans (Vonk et al. 2018 ). BM‐MSC‐EVs were added to chondrocyte cultures derived from individuals with OA to promote the production of type II collagen and proteoglycans. Moreover, BM‐MSC‐EVs could suppress inflammatory and catabolic indicators (iNOS and metalloproteinase‐13 (MMP‐13), ADAMTS5) while re‐inducing the production of chondrocyte markers such as type II collagen and aggrecan. They also prevented macrophage activation and rescued chondrocytes from apoptosis. Additionally, mice injected with both EVs and BM‐MSCs were safeguarded from joint injury in the collagenase‐induced OA model (Cosenza et al. 2017 ).\n\nEVs reflect the pathophysiology state of donor cells (Lo Cicero et al. 2015 ). Consequently, as previously reviewed (Abdal Dayem et al. 2024 ), EVs have demonstrated significant therapeutic and diagnostic potential in various diseases, including cancer (Xu et al. 2018 ), neurodegenerative disorders (Xia et al. 2022 ), cardiovascular diseases (Huang et al. 2021 ), inflammatory diseases (Buzas et al. 2014 ), fertility issues (Qamar et al. 2021 ), and prenatal genetic diagnosis (Saadeldin, Ehab, and Swelum 2023 ).\n\nEVs can be classified based on their size and biogenesis mode (Lotvall et al. 2014 ; Thery et al. 2018 ). The main subtypes of EVs include exosomes (50–200 nm) derived from multivesicular bodies, ectosomes or microvesicles (0.1–1 μm) generated by direct budding from the plasma membrane during direct budding, and apoptotic bodies (1–5 μm) produced throughout programmed cell death (Dixson et al. 2023 ; Trajkovic et al. 2008 ), as well as migrasomes released from cancer cells (da Rocha‐Azevedo and Schmid 2015 ; Ma et al. 2015 ). The purification of EVs can be carried out from various stem cell sources, which are obtained from umbilical cord (Liu, Liu, et al. 2023 ), Wharton's jelly (Chen, Ding, et al. 2023 ), bone marrow (Qin et al. 2023 ), adipose tissue (Cavallo et al. 2022 ), articular cartilage (Ning et al. 2023 ), synovial fluid (Zhang et al. 2023 ), serum (Feng et al. 2024 ), conditioned media (Swatler et al. 2020 ), milk (Babaker et al. 2022 ; Pieters et al. 2022 ), plant cells (Alzahrani et al. 2023 ), IFP (Kouroupis et al. 2022 ), and endometrium (Leñero et al. 2022 ). ADMSCs and their EVs play equally important roles in regenerative medicine. Notably, ADMSCs have been shown to exhibit superior immunomodulatory capacity compared to BM‐MSCs (Melief et al. 2013 ). In addition, ADMSCs possess the ability to differentiate into chondrocyte‐ and osteocyte‐like cells, highlighting their therapeutic versatility (Romano et al. 2023 ). ADMSC‐EVs have been shown to promote proliferation, migration, and osteogenic differentiation in both BM‐MSCs (Li et al. 2018 ) and human osteoblastic cells (Lu et al. 2017 ). Notably, Lu et al. further demonstrated that preconditioning ADMSC‐EVs with tumor necrosis factor‐alpha (TNFα) enhances bone regeneration by upregulating Wnt‐3a expression (Lu et al. 2017 ).\n\nOf note, the necessities for clinical applications cannot be met by the natural EV targeting capacities (Tkach and Thery 2016 ). EVs can help regenerate tissue, but they also have drawbacks like low yield, poor function, and low targeting that prevent them from meeting the requirements for both quantity and quality in the OA treatment (Cheng et al. 2022 ). Thus, engineering the EVs has been used for enhanced targeting and prolonged retention to treat OA effectively (Yin et al. 2022 ).\n\nThis review examines the development of innovative cell‐free therapies using EVs to address the challenges of OA treatment. We highlight the therapeutic roles of EVs in OA, with a focus on their anti‐inflammatory properties and regenerative potential. Additionally, we emphasize the latest strategies and technologies being developed for arthritis management, showcasing the potential of EVs to revolutionize treatment approaches.\n\nOverview of Arthritic Diseases\n\nThe knee joint, the biggest synovial joint in humans, consists of ligaments, cartilage (meniscus and articular cartilage), bone components (distal femur, proximal tibia, and patella), and synovium (Jang et al. 2021 ). The avascular cartilage is nourished and lubricated by synovial fluid produced by the synovium. Due to the high stress and frequent use of the knee, it is a common site for painful conditions, particularly OA (Mora et al. 2018 ; Rubin 2005 ). OA progresses slowly, often over years, with the disease worsening in phases or gradually over time, increasing the severity of symptoms (Martel‐Pelletier et al. 2016 ).\n\nThe diarthrodial joint, which connects adjacent bones, is enclosed by a synovial bursa and lined with articular cartilage (Netter 2014 ). This cartilage consists of over 70% water and an extracellular matrix rich in type II collagen, aggrecan, and proteoglycans (Martel‐Pelletier et al. 2016 ). Chondrocytes sense mechanical stress and matrix changes via receptors. In response to inflammatory or mechanical stimuli, collagenases and aggrecanases are overexpressed. The pericellular matrix protects inactive chondrocytes by preventing receptor interactions, while type II collagen networks, covered by proteoglycans, generally resist degradation (Houard et al. 2013 ).\n\nZinc‐dependent metalloproteinases (MMPs) and ADAMTS enzymes are key players in cartilage matrix breakdown. MMP‐3, a potent aggrecanase and MMP activator, along with collagenases MMP‐1 and MMP‐13, are particularly effective at degrading type II collagen (Troeberg and Nagase 2012 ). In a surgical OA model, ADAMTS5 (the major aggrecanase) mutant animals were rescued from OA aggravation, highlighting the role of proteoglycan diminution in cartilage attrition (Glasson et al. 2005 ). However, studies with MMP13 knockout animals suggest that aggrecan depletion alone does not propel OA advancement, though it does not prevent aggrecan loss (Little et al. 2009 ). Irrevocable cartilage degradation begins when the collagen network deteriorates (Houard et al. 2013 ). OA can be triggered by inflammation and overloading, which contribute to cartilage breakdown. Prostaglandin E2 is a key catabolic factor in OA, and MMPs play a crucial role in cartilage degeneration. Thus, the mechanosensitive enzyme microsomal prostaglandin E synthase‐1 may serve as a promising target for OA therapy (Little et al. 2009 ).\n\nDuring OA pathogenesis, cartilage progressively deteriorates due to chondrocyte depletion and phenotypic alterations, such as cluster formation, hypertrophic differentiation, and a shift toward a catabolic state (Jang et al. 2021 ). Subchondral bone undergoes remodeling, characterized by developing vascular channels that support osteoblasts and sensory nerves, enabling biochemical interaction between bone and cartilage. Chondrocytes produce factors such as cytokines, chemokines, and damage‐associated molecular patterns in response to various stimuli. These act as paracrine signals, driving a destructive cycle of cartilage breakdown, entering the synovial fluid, and activating macrophages and fibroblasts in the synovium, which leads to inflammation (Houard et al. 2013 ).\n\nSensory nerve endings within vascular channels, along with the innervation of articular cartilage, may play a role in tibiofemoral pain in OA, spanning different degrees of structural disease gravity (Suri et al. 2007 ). The mechanism of OA pathogenicity is depicted in Figure 2 .\n\nThe conventional view of OA as a disease confined to cartilage degeneration has been increasingly challenged. Emerging evidence supports the notion that OA is a whole‐joint disorder, in which synovitis plays a central role in driving cartilage degradation, pain, and other clinical manifestations (Sellam and Berenbaum 2010 ). Inflammation of the synovial membrane is a pronounced feature in the early and late stages of OA (Benito, Veale Dj Fau—FitzGerald, FitzGerald O Fau—van den Berg, van den Berg Wb Fau—Bresnihan, and Bresnihan). A pathological feedback loop exists wherein synovial inflammation contributes to cartilage breakdown, and cartilage degradation further exacerbates synovial inflammation. Inflamed synovial tissue releases proinflammatory cytokines, nitric oxide, prostaglandin E2, and neuropeptides, all contributing to accelerated cartilage damage (Benito et al. 2005 ; Raychaudhuri and Raychaudhuri 2009 ) (Sellam and Berenbaum 2010 ). These findings emphasize the synovium's central role in maintaining joint homeostasis and establish it as a critical therapeutic target in OA (Sellam and Berenbaum 2010 ).\n\nThe Significance of EV Sources\n\nThe source of EVs plays a critical role in determining their quality and therapeutic potential. Preclinical investigations have demonstrated that EVs, particularly those derived from stem cells like MSCs, effectively stimulate chondrocyte proliferation and extracellular matrix production. These EVs are enriched with growth factors and signaling molecules that facilitate chondrogenesis. Moreover, the therapeutic potential of EVs in cartilage repair can be enhanced through source cell selection, preconditioning, or specific modifications. EVs derived from adipose tissue, bone marrow, and synovial MSCs (SMSCs) enhance MSC viability, support cell migration, and demonstrate chondrogenic and osteogenic potential (Li, Liu, et al. 2021 ). Among them are the adipose‐derived stromal cell‐derived EVs (ADSC‐EVs) which demonstrate the most significant regenerative capacity.\n\nAdditionally, ADSC‐EVs have been reported to promote cartilage development (Sevimli et al. 2023 ). As human UCMSCs are easily accessible and ethically non‐controversial, their EVs inherit key advantages such as scalability, low immunogenicity, and ease of isolation, making them a safe and effective cell‐free alternative for regenerative therapies (Arutyunyan et al. 2016 ). Human UCMSC‐EVs present anti‐inflammatory and cartilage‐protective effects by reducing m6A methylation of NLRP3 via METTL3 interaction, thereby enhancing extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins (COL2A1, Aggrecan) and suppressing degradative enzymes (ADAMTS5, MMP13) (Zhou et al. 2022 ). Additionally, human UCMSC‐EVs promote M2 macrophage polarization and reduce interleukin‐1 beta (IL‐1β)‐induced inflammation in OA chondrocytes, contributing to cartilage preservation and immunomodulation (Li, Yan, et al. 2022 ; Li, Lv, et al. 2022 ). UCMSC‐EVs enhance cartilage regeneration by suppressing p53 signaling, reducing senescence‐related gene expression, and promoting type II collagen (COL II) production (Cao et al. 2023 ). Another study demonstrated the inhibitory activity of UCMSC‐EVs against inflammation and apoptosis concomitant with supporting chondrocyte proliferation and differentiation (Wang, Jiang, et al. 2023 ). Their therapeutic effect is mainly mediated by miR‐223, which targets NLRP3 to reduce pyroptosis and inflammatory responses, thereby restoring cartilage homeostasis and joint function (Liu, Liu, et al. 2023 ).\n\nEVs from human embryonic MSCs (hESC‐MSC‐EVs) have been shown to promote cartilage repair by enhancing matrix remodeling, accelerating cell proliferation, reducing apoptosis, and suppressing inflammatory cytokines (Zhang et al. 2018 ). In a rat model, Zhang et al. ( 2016 ) demonstrated that treatment with hESC‐MSC‐EVs led to complete cartilage regeneration within 12 weeks, whereas the control group showed only fibrous tissue formation. A study reported that hESC‐MSC‐EVs rescued the chondrocyte phenotype by increasing COL II and decreasing ADAMTS5, reducing cartilage damage in a destabilization of the medial meniscus (DMM) mouse OA model (Wang et al. 2017 ). Similarly, studies in temporomandibular joint OA showed these hESC‐MSC‐EVs reduced inflammation, restored homeostasis, promoted proliferation, and limited apoptosis, aiding joint repair (Zhang, Teo, et al. 2019 ).\n\nHuman tissue‐derived EVs typically exhibit low immunogenicity, making them feasible for therapeutic use. However, EVs from aged individuals may carry senescence‐associated factors that could negatively impact their regenerative potential. On the other hand, EVs derived from other mammals such as pigs (Guo and Fan 2023 ), mice (Cosenza et al. 2018 ; Qin et al. 2023 ; Shen et al. 2023 ), rats (Dong et al. 2021 ; Wang and Xu 2021 ; Wang et al. 2018 ), rabbits (Chen et al. 2018 ; Qi et al. 2019 ), and deer (Lei et al. 2022 ; Zhou et al. 2024 ) share physiological similarities with humans; however, their isolation and purification remain labor‐intensive, time‐consuming, and controversial findings. Moreover, the application of EVs derived from non‐human tissues may pose immunogenic risks and potential concerns related to zoonotic disease transmission. Plant‐derived EVs, in contrast, are more readily available and cost‐effective, though they currently lack well‐defined molecular markers for reliable identification (Chen, Xing, et al. 2023 ; Urzì et al. 2022 ).\n\nAdditionally, plant‐derived EVs present several challenges, including variability across plant species, inconsistencies in isolation protocols, absence of well‐defined EV markers, and a lack of supporting clinical trial data (Jin et al. 2024 ). Bacterial sources present another scalable option with high yields, but they pose a greater risk of contamination due to the presence of non‐target microbial components (Cheung et al. 2023 ; Dong et al. 2023 ; Toyofuku et al. 2023 ; Wang, Mo, et al. 2022 ). In addition, Cow's milk‐derived EVs (CMEVs) have been shown to have the therapeutic potential of local CMEV delivery in OA joints, in which CMEVs are carriers of both transforming growth factor (TGFβ) and miR‐148a, which are two essential regulators for maintaining chondrocyte homeostasis and protection against cartilage destruction (Pieters et al. 2022 ).\n\nEV Engineering/Modification Strategies\n\nThe Significance of EV Engineering\n\nEVs act as nanocarriers loaded with bioactive molecules, offering significant potential for cartilage tissue repair and OA treatment. However, challenges such as low yield, limited circulatory stability, and inadequate targeting capabilities currently hinder their effectiveness in disease therapy (Kimiz‐Gebologlu and Oncel 2022 ; Ma, Xie, et al. 2024 ). Additionally, preserving collected EVs is challenging, requiring careful measures to prevent chemical reactions, degradation, or loss of function during storage. Although an optimal protocol for preserving EV quality and functionality has yet to be established, research consistently shows that EVs should be stored below room temperature to prevent degradation (Ahmadian et al. 2024 ). For short‐term storage—typically less than 1 month—4°C may be sufficient; however, EVs still exhibit reduced stability at this temperature, with studies reporting up to a 32% decrease in EV count (Ahmadian et al. 2024 ; Sivanantham and Jin 2022 ), almost a 32% loss in EV count (Ahmadian et al. 2024 ). Lowering the storage temperature to −80°C, or employing lyophilization to minimize freeze–thaw cycles has been shown to preserve EV structure and functionality (Sivanantham and Jin 2022 ). The latest review highlights the importance of tube coating (replacing polypropylene tubes with low protein‐binding ones) to avoid EVs adsorbing to the container's walls, or replacing it with an EVs lyophilization approach (Sivanantham and Jin 2022 ).\n\nThe large‐scale production of EVs for therapeutic applications remains a significant challenge, primarily due to the lack of an optimal extraction method capable of achieving high purity during EV isolation and purification (Yang, Xue, et al. 2024 ; Sivanantham and Jin 2022 ). However, EVs are considered promising vehicles for therapeutic delivery, as they can efficiently cross various biological barriers—including the blood–brain barrier (Chen et al. 2016 ) and have demonstrated the ability to overcome chemoresistance (Contentin et al. 2022 ). Moreover, EVs can effectively deliver their molecular cargo while minimizing toxicity and eliciting minimal immune responses (Elsharkasy et al. 2020 ).\n\nEV Engineering Strategies\n\nThe retention of EVs following in vivo administration remains a concern, as they are rapidly cleared from the bloodstream. The primary challenge in using natural EVs for therapeutic applications is their limited retention at the injury site and inadequate homing ability (Conlan et al. 2017 ; Riau et al. 2019 ).\n\nEV engineering can be classifiedas exogenous (i.e., after EV isolation) and endogenous loading (i.e., during EV biogenesis) (Vader et al. 2016). Both the membrane and cargo of EVs can be engineered either endogenously or exogenously for therapeutic applications. Endogenous EV engineering refers to modulating EV‐secreting (parent) cells by exposing them to stress‐induced conditions or transfecting these parent cells with exogenous compounds, such as nucleic acids, small molecules, lipids, and proteins. Exogenous EV engineering involves modifying the purified EVs to enhance their therapeutic potential. This includes leveraging the hydrophobic properties of EV membranes to load cargo onto the EV surface or using physical methods (e.g., membrane permeabilization) and chemical transfection to incorporate cargo into the EV lumen. Additionally, EV membranes can encapsulate cargo‐loaded nanoparticles (NPs), or EVs can be fused with cargo‐carrying lipid NPs (LNPs) to improve delivery efficiency. As summarized in Figure 3 , EV engineering can occur both during biogenesis and post‐biogenesis (Zhao et al. 2023 ). A variety of engineering strategies have been developed, including chemistry‐based methods (e.g., coupling reactions and direct membrane insertion), biology‐based approaches (e.g., genetic transfection), physical techniques (e.g., extrusion, freeze–thaw cycles, sonication, and electrostatic adsorption), as well as combinational methods (Jie Wang et al. 2024 ).\n\nChemical‐Based Engineering\n\nThis approach focuses on using chemical groups that modify exosomal proteins with alkyne moieties, enabling site‐specific conjugation through azide–alkyne cycloaddition. Specifically, copper‐catalyzed azide–alkyne cycloaddition facilitates the attachment of ligands to the surface of exosomes (Liang et al. 2021 ). This technique is commonly employed to pre‐isolate EVs from body fluids or culture media, offering a fast, simple, and efficient strategy (Jie Wang et al. 2024 ). However, a key limitation of this method lies in its susceptibility to non‐specific protein–protein interactions, which can compromise the precision of targeted protein modifications (Liang et al. 2021 ; Smyth et al. 2014 ).\n\nThe use of the EVs lipid bilayer through the insertion of amphipathic molecules is another chemical engineering approach using polyethylene glycol (PEG) for targeted delivery in lung cancer, showing high efficiency (Kim, Haney, et al. 2018 ). In OA lesions, MSCs were genetically modified to target ligands on chondrocytes or synovial cells by combining the lysosome‐associated membrane glycoprotein 2b (LAMP2B) present on the surface of exosomes with a chondrocyte‐affinity peptide (CAP) (Liang, Xu, et al. 2020 ).\n\nGenetic Modification‐Based Engineering\n\nA commonly used biology‐based technique for modifying EV membranes is genetic transfection (Koyama et al. 2016 ). This technique is based on inserting the desired ligand's gene sequence into donor cells employing a gene transfer vector, such as lentiviral or retroviral vectors. The gene sequence can encode the particular signal peptide or protein in the donor cells, ensuring that the peptide or protein of interest is present on the membrane as the donor cells' EVs are released (You et al. 2018 ). Exosomes that target chondrocytes have been employed to deliver miR‐140 into chondrocytes in the OA rat model. This was accomplished by combining LAMP2B with a CAP on the surface of exosomes to generate CAP‐exosomes, which effectively encapsulate miR‐140 (Liang, Xu, et al. 2020 ). Another approach explored involved the use of calcitonin gene‐related peptide (CGRP) neuropeptide derived from IFP (Liebmann et al. 2024 ). In this study, IFP‐MSCs were transduced with an adenoviral vector carrying the CGRP gene to generate CGRP‐overexpressing IFP‐MSCs. EVs derived from these modified cells were isolated, and subsequent analysis of their miRNA and protein cargo revealed enrichment in pathways related to pain regulation, inflammation modulation, and cartilage homeostasis (Liebmann et al. 2024 ).\n\nAdditionally, the fabrication of chondrocyte‐targeting exosomes (CAP‐Exo) was performed by the fusion of CAP with the exosomal surface protein LAMP2B at its N‐terminus. Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats associated protein 9 (CRISPR/Cas9) plasmids were encapsulated in hybrid CAP‐exosomes (hybrid CAP‐Exo) developed through the membrane fusion of CAP‐Exo with liposomes. Intra‐articular (IA) injection of hybrid CAP‐Exo/Cas9 single‐guide RNA targeting MMP‐13 (sgMMP‐13) into rats led to its internalization by chondrocytes and consequently induced cartilage degeneration resembling OA. In arthritic rats, chondrocyte‐specific MMP‐13 knockdown decreases or inhibits cartilage disintegration, suggesting that hybrid CAP‐Exo/Cas9 sgMMP‐13 could possess therapeutic activity in OA (Liang et al. 2022 ).\n\nPhysical‐Based EV Engineering\n\nThis approach involves membrane engineering, where hybrid EVs are generated by fusing the membranes of EVs and liposomes through the freeze–thaw process (Sato et al. 2016 ). An approach was addressed by Yan et al. treating rheumatoid arthritis (RA) via using dexamethasone sodium phosphate (Dex)‐loaded exosomes (Exo/Dex) encapsulated by electroporation (Yan et al. 2020 ). Electroporation was also used for DNA co‐loaded exosomes for treating RA in vivo using a mouse model (Liang, Xu, et al. 2020 ).\n\nCo‐Culture Strategies\n\nChallenges such as low EV production rates and limited cargo enrichment may be addressed with the advancement of EV engineering, whether through direct or indirect methods (Esmaeili et al. 2021 ). One promising form of indirect EV engineering is the co‐culture technique, which has the potential to increase EV yields significantly (Esmaeili et al. 2021 ). This approach simulates in vivo interactions and mechanisms, providing valuable insights into cell communication and behavior (Shimasaki et al. 2018 ).\n\nOther indirect methods for EV engineering, such as co‐culture platforms and three‐dimensional (3D) culture, have also been shown to produce higher yields and enhanced therapeutic activity. Previous reports have demonstrated that co‐culturing MSCs and chondrocytes accelerates chondrogenic differentiation (Baghaban Eslaminejad et al. 2009 ; Giovannini et al. 2010 ). In comparison to chondrocyte or synovium‐derived stem cells (SDSCs) monocultures, a study by Kim et al. demonstrated that direct co‐culture of human chondrocytes and SDSCs significantly promoted chondrogenic capacity, particularly at a 1:1 ratio (Kim, Lee, et al. 2018 ).\n\nRye et al. demonstrated the anti‐inflammatory activity of human SDSCs after co‐culture with sodium nitroprusside‐stimulated chondrocytes, representing an in vitro model of OA or RA. This co‐culture significantly suppressed inflammatory cytokine secretion, reduced inflammation‐related gene expression, stimulated IGF‐1 production, and increased the chondrocyte proliferation rate (Ryu et al. 2014 ). Additionally, research indicates that MSCs contribute to remodeling and promoting chondrocyte proliferation, while chondrocytes, in turn, stimulate the chondrogenesis of MSCs (Xu et al. 2016 ). This reciprocal effect is proposed to be mediated through the paracrine mechanism, mainly by EVs (Kim, Steinberg, et al. 2019 ). To deliver chondrogenic growth factors in situ, chondrocytes pre‐transduced with adenoviral vectors expressing the TGF‐β3 gene were used as transgenic partner cells and co‐cultured with SMSCs in a 3D environment. This co‐culture system, combined with TGF‐β3 gene delivery, provides a promising approach to cartilage tissue engineering (Zhang et al. 2015 ).\n\nIn this concept, an interesting study by Esmaeili et al. aimed to assess the yield and therapeutic efficacy of EVs derived from rabbit MSC aggregates EVs, chondrocyte aggregates EVs, and their co‐aggregates EVs in a spinner flasks‐assisted dynamic 3D culture, using an OA rat model (Esmaeili et al. 2022 ). The in vitro analysis of this study demonstrated that MSC aggregates EVs, chondrocyte aggregates EVs, and co‐aggregates EVs stimulated chondrogenesis with effects comparable to those of TGF‐beta. Nonetheless, co‐aggregated EVs were more effective at slowing the progression of OA compared to MSC‐ag and chondrocyte aggregated EVs (Esmaeili et al. 2022 ).\n\nTherefore, the co‐culture strategy effectively enhances both EV yield and quality as an indirect EV engineering technique. In this context, EVs have been shown to improve chondrogenesis, exhibit anti‐inflammatory effects, and promote regenerative properties in co‐cultured MSCs and chondrocytes within both two‐dimensional (2D) and 3D systems (Esmaeili et al. 2024 ).\n\nKim et al. demonstrated that co‐culturing juvenile bovine chondrocytes with adult MSCs enhances matrix formation and promotes functional differentiation (Kim, Steinberg, et al. 2019 ). In this study, the authors co‐cultured the cells in a 4:1 MSC‐to‐chondrocyte ratio within MeHA‐loaded hydrogel. Their findings emphasize that proximity between the two cell types is crucial for this interaction, leading to enhanced survival, chondrogenesis, matrix production, and homeostasis in the recipient MSCs. Furthermore, they showed that inhibiting EV transfer prevents the synergistic effects of the co‐culture, identifying EVs as the primary mode of communication in these interactions. EVs secreted by juvenile CHs travel through the extracellular space to adult MSC recipient cells, entering via clathrin‐mediated endocytosis. This process is disrupted when clathrin inhibitor Pitstop2 is used; Figure 4 . These findings offer valuable insights for developing therapeutic agents and more efficient delivery systems to support cartilage regeneration. Additionally, Figure 5 illustrates both the direct and indirect methods of EV engineering.\n\nThree‐Dimensional ( 3D ) Culture Platform\n\n3D culture of EV parental cell source is one of the most effective indirect methods for enhancing both the yield and quality of EVs. Advances in stem cell research have led to the development of 3D organoid models that closely mimic native tissue architecture and physiological functions. Spheroids are self‐organized cell clusters with specific structures and functions, derived from human adult stem cells or pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) following 3D in vitro culture (Chen et al. 2022 ). MSC spheroids have been shown to improve cell survival and therapeutic signaling following transplantation into in vivo models (Kouroupis and Correa 2021 ). Moreover, spheroid‐derived EVs have emerged as promising cell‐free nanocarriers due to their vesicular cargo physiological effects, significant biological functions, stable loading capacity, and excellent biocompatibility.\n\nCells cultured in 2D produce fewer EVs with lower bioactivity and reduced protein and nucleic acid content, whereas organoids cultured in 3D generate a higher quantity of EVs, along with increased protein and nucleic acid levels (Liu and Su 2023a ). Figure 6 summarizes the key potentials of 3D EVs over 2D EVs.\n\nOrganoids are self‐organized cellular structures with specific roles, generated from adult or PSCs through 3D in vitro culture (Chen et al. 2022 ; Keshara et al. 2022 ). Additionally, organoid‐derived EVs (OEVs) have gained significant attention for their higher quantity, enhanced biological properties, and stronger therapeutic effects compared to regular EVs (Liu and Su 2023b ). OEVs and organoids can potentially treat complex diseases, including age‐related bone disorders (Liu and Su 2023a , 2023b ).\n\nEV‐loaded DNA hydrogels are feasible platforms for cartilage organoids and have demonstrated tremendous potential in the exploration of pathogenic processes, therapeutic drug development, and cartilage growth (Ma, Li, et al. 2023 ). By incorporating natural or engineered EVs with chondrogenic activity into the DNA hydrogel system, they can replace traditional growth factors and promote the formation of stable cartilage organoids as shown in Figure 7 . The new approach to organoid EVs will provide more innovative and efficient solutions for complex bone diseases and OA.\n\nArtificial Intelligence ‐Driven EV Engineering and Target Prediction\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) serves as a powerful technological and computational tool for analyzing large‐scale data, both with and without human supervision, in healthcare and biomedical research. Moreover, it has facilitated advanced studies on organoids and EVs (Akbar et al. 2021 ; Diaz‐Flores et al. 2022 ; Liu et al. 2024 ). Integrating AI with EV analysis holds great promise for improving diagnostic precision, enabling earlier detection and more effective monitoring of cancer progression and treatment response (Garcia‐Barberan et al. 2025 ). AI offers powerful predictive tools to guide the rational design of engineered EVs for precise drug delivery; however, the inherent heterogeneity of EVs presents a significant challenge to achieving accurate molecular targeting (Greenberg et al. 2023 ).\n\nUtilizing machine learning to analyze tumor‐derived EV cargo data can support the development of biomarker panels for classifying tumor types or phenotypes (Kong et al. 2024 ). A recent study introduced a freeze–thaw‐induced floating pattern analysis approach, which, in combination with AI algorithms, successfully identified EVs originating from different breast cancer subtypes (Xie et al. 2024 ). Notably, a random forest algorithm trained on the freeze–thaw microstructures of EVs achieved a high classification accuracy of 95.56% in distinguishing their originating cell lines. Furthermore, it demonstrated robust performance in analyzing clinical samples ( n = 156), accurately differentiating between EVs from healthy donors, patients with benign breast lumps, and various breast cancer subtypes, with an overall accuracy of 83.33% (Xie et al. 2025 ). Principal component analysis, a machine learning technique, has been used to analyze morphological differences in exosomes derived from immature dendritic cells, highlighting the diagnostic potential of dynamic EV structures (Cansever Mutlu et al. 2022 ). Characterizing EV morphology across different biological samples can provide valuable structural insights, which may serve as novel biomarkers for various human diseases (Cansever Mutlu et al. 2022 ; Saadeldin, Ehab, and Cho 2023 ).\n\nAnother innovative AI application in EV research is ChatExosome, a large language model (LLM)–based system designed to facilitate clinical spectroscopic analysis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) diagnosis (Yang et al. 2025 ). ChatExosome comprises two key components. The first is a deep learning model that analyzes Raman spectral fingerprints of exosomes derived from HCC. Utilizing a patch‐based one‐dimensional self‐attention mechanism with downsampling, a Feature Fusion Transformer was developed to process the spectra, achieving classification accuracies of 95.8% for cell‐derived exosomes and 94.1% for 165 clinical samples. The second component is an interactive LLM‐based chat agent, which employs a retrieval‐augmented generation method to enhance knowledge integration related to exosomes (Yang et al. 2025 ). Additionally, other studies have introduced MPAPASS, a software tool enabling stitched, multiplex, multidimensional EV repertoire analysis and providing a standardized framework for reporting bead‐based assays (Contentin et al. 2022 ). These advances demonstrate how AI technologies serve as cutting‐edge tools in EV research, supporting their diagnostic and therapeutic applications across a range of diseases, including arthritis.\n\nEV Pathophysiological Role in the Onset of Joint Disease\n\nIn pathological conditions, EVs facilitate cell communication and can act as signaling components that contribute to the initiation and exacerbation of inflammation and immune responses. As a result, certain EVs may be pathogenic in joint diseases (Beyer and Pisetsky 2010 ; Dye et al. 2013 ; Foers et al. 2017 ; Fu et al. 2018 ; Withrow et al. 2016 ). The role of EVs in inflammation varies depending on the cell type, source, environment, and the influence of multiple factors. EVs secreted by activated human monocytes have been shown to elevate nuclear factor kappa‐light‐chain‐enhancer of activated B cells (NF‐κB) levels and promote the production of oxygen radicals and cytokines, potentially exacerbating the inflammatory response. Simultaneously, these EVs can upregulate the expression of peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor gamma, a protein associated with inflammation modulation (Bardelli et al. 2012 ). Furthermore, T cell‐derived EVs modulate TNFα effects, indicating a potential interaction between cytokines and EVs. In addition to enhancing the inflammation process, EV therapy markedly boosted the expression of several anti‐inflammatory genes (Szabó et al. 2014 ).\n\nSynovial EVs may be produced under inflammatory conditions, leading articular cells to release additional degradative enzymes and inflammatory mediators, which can ultimately cause articular damage (Kato et al. 2014 ; Pásztói et al. 2013 ). Because some EVs are also composed of degradation enzymes, EVs generated by rheumatoid synovial fibroblasts break down aggrecan in a way that is susceptible to tissue inhibitors of MMP‐3. That could render it easier for cells to invade ECMs that are rich in aggrecan (Cicero et al. 2012 ). In this prime, hexosaminidase activity has been linked to EVs generated from RA synovial fibroblasts (Pásztói et al. 2013 ). Conversely, it has been demonstrated that EVs secreted by chondrocytes are controlled by autophagy and that they play a role in the pathological calcification of cartilage in musculoskeletal disorders such as OA (Rosenthal et al. 2015 ).\n\nEngineered EV for Cartilage Regeneration\n\nDespite their therapeutic promise, the clinical application of native EVs faces several limitations, including low tissue specificity, rapid systemic clearance, short half‐life, limited therapeutic efficacy, challenges in tracking in vivo distribution, and inefficient uptake by target cells (Komuro et al. 2022 ; Xu et al. 2022 ; Zeng, Chen, et al. 2022 ). To address these challenges, engineered EVs have emerged as a promising alternative, offering enhanced functionality through various modifications. For instance, altering surface ligands can improve targeting efficiency, while integrating sustained‐release platforms derived from materials science can extend their therapeutic effects. Additionally, the therapeutic payload of EVs can be augmented by incorporating small molecules, proteins, or nucleic acids. Furthermore, tracking and imaging of EVs in vivo can be facilitated by introducing imaging agents during engineering. These modifications also enhance cellular uptake by target tissues, ultimately improving therapeutic outcomes (Bie et al. 2022 ; El Andaloussi et al. 2013 ; Frolova and Li 2022 ). EVs can be administered through various methods, including direct injection (Hu, Li, et al. 2021 ; Mao et al. 2018 ) or by incorporation into various biomaterial matrices (Lin et al. 2020 ; Liu et al. 2020 ).\n\nRecent advancements in bioengineering have significantly improved the therapeutic potential of EVs. For instance, Zhao et al. demonstrated that AD‐MSC‐EVs derived from subcutaneous adipose tissue could be engineered to deliver miR‐199a‐3p, effectively enhancing cartilage repair (Zhao et al. 2023 ). Another study utilized magnetic polysaccharide‐based microcarriers to load MSC‐EVs, thereby improving targeted delivery and producing synergistic effects in OA treatment (Yang, Li, et al. 2024 ). Additionally, Ma et al. introduced a novel delivery platform that incorporates EVs carrying activating transcription factor 5 (ATF5)–modified mRNA into thermosensitive hydrogels, showing that this system can alleviate OA symptoms via modulation of mitochondrial signaling pathways (Ma, Xu, et al. 2024 ).\n\nA widely adopted strategy for engineering the surface of EVs involves genetically modifying EV‐producing cells using plasmid vectors that encode transmembrane fusion proteins. One frequently utilized exosomal membrane protein for surface display is LAMP‐2B, which can be engineered to present specific targeting motifs or peptides by fusing them with proteins or antibody fragments to enhance binding affinity to desired target cells (Salunkhe et al. 2020 ). For instance, Liang et al. constructed a plasmid encoding a fusion of a chondrocyte affinity peptide (CAP), green fluorescent protein, and LAMP‐2B, and used it to transfect dendritic cells, resulting in CAP‐functionalized exosomes with specific affinity for chondrocytes (Liang, Xu, et al. 2020 ). These modified exosomes exhibited prolonged retention and reduced dispersion around chondrocytes. Utilizing CAP, the engineered EVs effectively delivered miRNA‐140 into the deeper layers of cartilage tissue, contributing to OA treatment.\n\nZhang et al. engineered dibenzyl cyclooctene‐conjugated exosomes through copper‐free click chemistry, which were subsequently combined with azide‐functionalized Prussian blue nanoparticles (uPB) to produce uPB‐exosomes (Zhang, Qin, et al. 2022 ). These hybrid exosomes effectively targeted activated fibroblast‐like synoviocytes, mitigating inflammatory responses by neutralizing pro‐inflammatory cytokines and scavenging ROS, alleviating inflammatory stress. In a murine model, these engineered exosomes demonstrated notable efficacy in joint tissue repair, underscoring their potential for clinical application. Moreover, uPB‐exosomes showed promise as sensitive and specific diagnostic tools for early detection of RA, potentially preventing irreversible joint damage associated with advanced stages of the disease (Zhang, Qin, et al. 2022 ). Taken together, these findings offer great potential for both the diagnosis and effective treatment of advanced RA in a clinical setting.\n\nA study explores the therapeutic potential of the engineered hMSC‐EVs that have been genetically modified to overexpress the long non‐coding RNA MALAT‐1 (Pan et al. 2021 ). The research aims to determine whether these MALAT‐1‐enriched EVs (hMSC MALAT‐1 ‐EVs) can mitigate inflammation and protect against cartilage breakdown associated with OA. In vitro and in vivo studies demonstrated that hMSC‐EVs lacking MALAT‐1 markedly suppressed inflammation, minimized chondrocyte apoptosis and extracellular matrix breakdown, enhanced chondrocyte proliferation and migration, and significantly improved cartilage integrity in a rat model of OA, highlighting their promise as an innovative therapeutic strategy for OA.\n\nShen et al. demonstrate that exosomes derived from hypoxia‐preconditioned BM‐MSC (H‐Exos) significantly enhance chondrocyte proliferation, migration, anabolic activity, and anti‐inflammatory responses compared to normoxia‐derived exosomes (Shen et al. 2022 ). Based on this study, hypoxia elevated miR‐205‐5p expression, which promoted chondrocyte function via the phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN)/AKT pathway. An injectable silk fibroin hydrogel loaded with H‐Exos and chondrocytes further improved cartilage repair in vivo. These findings highlight the potential of combining hypoxia‐optimized exosome therapy with biomaterial delivery systems to advance cartilage regeneration.\n\nThe CRISPR/Cas9 system has emerged as a highly effective and versatile genome editing platform, holding considerable promise for gene therapy applications (Tanikella et al. 2020 ). This technology has introduced novel therapeutic strategies modifying specific genes within MSCs, chondrocytes, and adjacent osteoblasts to reduce OA progression (Brunger et al. 2017 ; Lambert et al. 2016 ; Yin et al. 2022 ). For instance, to counteract the inflammation‐driven inhibition of cartilage regeneration, Karlsen et al. engineered human articular chondrocytes by deleting the interleukin‐1β receptor (IL1R1), making these cells unresponsive to pro‐inflammatory IL‐1β signaling (Karlsen et al. 2016 ). These modified cells may then be reintroduced into OA‐affected joints to enhance their therapeutic efficacy. Future studies exploring the isolation and characterization of EVs from these cells will be essential.\n\nEffective in vivo application of CRISPR/Cas9 relies profoundly on the successful delivery of its active components to target cells, which remains a major challenge, particularly with regard to loading large nucleic acid constructs into EVs. To address this issue, Lin et al. designed a liposome hybrid NPs delivery system by fusing CRISPR/Cas9‐loaded liposomes with exosomes at 37°C overnight, facilitating membrane integration (Lin et al. 2018 ). This approach enabled BM‐MSCs to internalize these hybrid NPs and activate the gene‐editing system, effectively silencing Runx2. Additionally, surface functionalization of these hybrids with targeting ligands holds the potential for directing them toward specific cell populations, such as synovial macrophages or articular chondrocytes, in vivo. The following sections additionally explore potential studies focused on engineering EVs through various cargo‐loading strategies and surface modifications.\n\nAs the understanding of EVs biology and engineering advances, future research should prioritize the optimization of these therapies and their translation into clinical practice to address the growing impact of arthritis diseases and cartilage regeneration.\n\nRoles of EV Cargo in Cartilage Regeneration\n\nDelivery of EV microRNAs\n\nRecent research has underscored the pivotal role of miRNAs in regulating cartilage homeostasis (Fujii et al. 2022 ; Razmara et al. 2019 ). The in vitro chondrogenic differentiation of MSCs is a widely employed model for investigating how miRNAs influence chondrocyte proliferation and differentiation.\n\nmiRNAs are key regulators in OA pathogenesis, impacting cartilage health, inflammation, and the degradation of joint structures. While much is still being explored, miRNAs hold promise for future OA diagnosis, treatment, and even prevention strategies (Tong et al. 2022 ). Understanding the cellular and molecular processes that cause matrix alterations, chondrocyte differentiation, and dedifferentiation patterns is essential to repairing injured articular cartilage. It is challenging to gauge the impact of these factors on the structural integrity of articular cartilage, but achieving this is critical (Kong et al. 2017 ). Emerging evidence features miRNAs as promising therapeutic agents in cartilage repair (Foo et al. 2021 ). For example, a hydrogel‐based miRNA delivery system aimed at rejuvenating the cartilage microenvironment by mitigating chondrocyte senescence, a major contributor to cartilage degradation in OA (Zhu et al. 2022 ). miR‐23a‐3p—enriched in human UCMSC‐derived EVs has—been shown to enhance cartilage repair through targeted delivery (Hongxing Hu et al. 2020 ). Additionally, EVs isolated from chondrogenic progenitor cells of MRL/MpJ superhealer mice that are enriched in miR‐221‐3p are associated with improved cartilage regeneration in a DMM model of OA (Wang et al. 2020 ).\n\nmiR‐23b regulates protein kinase A, which plays a key role in MSC differentiation into chondrocytes (Ham et al. 2012 ). Additionally, miR‐221 suppresses Slug degradation while undergoing the chondrogenesis of chick limb mesenchymal cells by inhibiting mouse double minute 2 homolog (MDM2), which consequently influences cell proliferation (Kim et al. 2010 ). miR‐92a shows that it has a role in maintaining bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) activity during pharyngeal cartilage formation by targeting the Nog3 gene (Ning et al. 2013 ). Additionally, miR‐92a played a role in chondrogenesis and the IL‐1β‐mediated chondrocyte response. miR‐92a had a beneficial effect on collagen alpha‐2 chain IX (COL9A2) and aggrecan expression.\n\nNotably, miR‐130b‐3p targets the mRNA of the LDL receptor‐related protein 12 (LRP12) in chondrocytes (Zeng, Dai, et al. 2022 ). In the context of OA, EVs play a therapeutic role by alleviating chondrocyte damage through the miR‐130b‐3p‐mediated inhibition of the LRP12/AKT/β‐catenin axis. Additionally, BM‐MSCs cultured with platelet‐rich plasma (PRP) release therapeutic molecules that support the utilization of this combinational therapy for OA treatment. When BM‐MSCs are transplanted into OA joints, their secreted factors and EV‐miRNAs promote their anti‐inflammatory and tissue‐regenerative capabilities (Ragni, Perucca Orfei, De Luca, et al. 2022 ).\n\nAnother study has demonstrated that transplantation of induced pluripotent stem cell‐derived MSC‐exosomes (iPS‐MSC‐Exso) had a robust therapeutic effect compared to synovial membrane MSC‐exosomes. Additionally, the proliferation and migration of chondrocytes were boosted by iPS‐MSC‐Exos and MSC‐exosomes, with iPS‐MSC‐Exos exerting a stronger effect after their IA injection in a mouse model of collagenase‐induced OA (Zhu et al. 2017 ). Furthermore, the therapeutic potential of human bone marrow‐derived MSCs (hBM‐MSCs) and their EVs in cartilage repair has been investigated. In the rabbit model, local injection of hBM‐MSC‐Exosomes enhances cartilage regeneration, as demonstrated by the gross view and hematoxylin–eosin (H&E) and Safranin‐O/Fast Green staining. Moreover, the researchers showed an improved International Cartilage Repair Society (ICRS) score following the IA administration of hBM‐MSC‐Exosomes. Furthermore, treatment with hBM‐MSC‐Exosomes significantly promotes cell viability and proliferation in primary chondrocytes in a dose‐dependent manner. Wound healing assays also demonstrate that hBM‐MSC‐Exosomes enhance cell migration. Additionally, JC‐1 staining revealed elevated mitochondrial membrane potential, indicating reduced apoptosis in cells treated with hBM‐MSC‐derived exosomes (Yang et al. 2022 ). Another study reported that BM‐MSC‐exosomes can modulate c‐MYC in a mouse model of OA, thereby regulating chondrocyte glutamine metabolism and alleviating OA symptoms (Jiang et al. 2021 ).\n\nA study revealed that the p38, extracellular signal‐regulated kinase (ERK), and Akt pathways are involved in the inhibition of mitochondrial‐induced apoptosis by BM‐MSC exosomes in response to IL‐1β (Qi et al. 2019 ). Moreover, SMSC‐derived EVs contribute to the regeneration of OA cartilage by delivering miR‐26a‐5p to chondrocytes, where it upregulates miR‐26a‐5p expression and suppresses PTEN. This process reduces inflammation and apoptosis, mitigating OA cartilage damage (Lu, Wang, et al. 2021 ).\n\nMoreover, MSC‐EVs facilitated osteochondral defect repair, characterized by rapid cellular proliferation and infiltration. This effect is caused by CD73‐related activation of AKT ERK signaling through exosomal adenosine. The increase in cell migration and proliferation was inhibited by suppressing phosphorylation of ERK or AKT, but not matrix production (Zhang et al. 2018 ). The role of exosomal CD73 was further underscored by its attenuation through adenosine monophosphate, cyclic phosphate, a CD73 inhibitor, and theophylline, an adenosine receptor antagonist. Furthermore, defects treated with EVs revealed a regenerative immune profile, characterized by a decrease in synovial cytokines TNF‐α and IL‐1β and an increase in CD163 + regenerative M2 macrophages relative to pro‐inflammatory CD86 + M1 macrophages (Zhang et al. 2018 ).\n\nMSC‐EV‐enriched miR‐100‐5p could suppress the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) in an OA mouse model to safeguard articular cartilage and improve abnormalities in gait (Wu et al. 2019 ). Exosomal RNA‐seq data demonstrated that miR‐100‐5p displayed the highest level of binding affinity for the 3′ untranslated region (3′‐UTR) of mTOR. MSC‐Exosomes reduced mTOR 3′UTR luciferase activity; however, the suppression of miR‐100‐5p could reverse the mTOR signaling pathway that MSC‐Exosomes had decreased. The protective effect of MSC‐Exosomes on articular cartilage was significantly reduced in vivo by IA injection of antagomir‐miR‐100‐5p (Wu et al. 2019 ). WNT5a and exosome miR‐92a‐3p are implicated in chondrogenesis and cartilage degradation (Mao et al. 2018 ). In this study, compared to normal cartilage, exosomal miR‐92a‐3p expression was significantly lower in the OA chondrocyte‐secreted exosome but improved in the MSC chondrogenic exosome. MSCs and primary human chondrocytes treated with MSC‐miR‐92a‐3p‐Exosomes exhibited enhanced cartilage proliferation and matrix gene expression. Furthermore, by upregulating WNT5a expression, MSC‐anti‐miR‐92a‐3p‐Exosomes treatment suppressed chondrogenic differentiation and decreased cartilage matrix formation. The luciferase reporter test revealed that miR‐92a‐3p reduced WNT5a expression in MSCs and primary healthcare centers and hindered the activity of a reporter construct containing the 3′‐UTR. In the model of OA mice, cartilage degeneration is inhibited by MSC‐miR‐92a‐3p‐Exosomes (Mao et al. 2018 ).\n\nExosomes from SMSC overexpressing miR‐140‐5p (SMSC‐140s) and enriched in Wnt5a and Wnt5b have been shown to activate Yes‐associated protein (YAP) via the alternative Wnt signaling pathway (Tao et al. 2017 ). This activation enhanced the proliferation and migration of chondrocytes, but also significantly reduced ECM secretion as a side effect. The overexpression of miR‐140‐5p effectively prevented this adverse effect through RalA. In vitro, SMSC‐140‐Exosomes enhanced AC migration and proliferation without compromising extracellular matrix secretion. In a rat model, SMSC‐140‐Exosomes successfully prevented OA in vivo (Tao et al. 2017 ).\n\nDelivery of EV Long Non‐Coding RNAs\n\nLong non‐coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been increasingly recognized for their significant role in the onset of OA and other degenerative joint diseases. Specifically, minichromosome maintenance 3‐associated protein‐antisense 1 (MCM3AP‐AS1) is decreased in OA cartilage tissues, where it is positively associated with SIRT1 expression and negatively correlated with miR‐138‐5p. The upregulation of MCM3AP‐AS1 reduces apoptosis and inflammation while improving the viability and migration of CHON‐001 and ATDC5 cells. However, the overexpression of miR‐138‐5p reverses the beneficial effects of MCM3AP‐AS1 overexpression on chondrocytes (Shi et al. 2021 ).\n\nIt has been demonstrated that exosomal lncRNA MEG‐3 suppresses IL‐1β‐mediated chondrocyte senescence and apoptosis, demonstrating that lncRNA MEG‐3 may contribute to the anti‐OA activities of BM‐MSC exosomes (Jin et al. 2021 ). Exosome derived from KLF3‐AS1‐overexpressing MSCs (MSC KLF3‐AS1‐Exo) was shown to function as a competitive endogenous RNA (ceRNA) by sponging miR‐206 to promote GIT1 expression. This mechanism involved MSC KLF3‐AS1‐Exo‐mediated enhancement of chondrocyte proliferation and reduced chondrocyte death via the miR‐206/GIT1 axis. Additionally, the decrease of chondrocyte damage mediated by MSC‐exosomes was reversed by miR‐206 overexpression and GIT1 knockdown (Liu, Lin, et al. 2018 ).\n\nAnother study demonstrated that exosomal KLF3‐AS1 inhibited IL‐1β‐induced chondrocyte apoptosis and that lncRNA KLF3‐AS1 was significantly enriched in MSC‐derived exosomes. Further in vivo research showed that exosomal KLF3‐AS1 enhanced cartilage regeneration in a rat model of OA (Liu, Zou, et al. 2018 ). Exosomes derived from the serum of OA patients and lipopolysaccharide‐treated C28/I2 cells enhanced plasmacytoma variant translocation 1 (PVT1) expression in C28/I2 cells, with exosome‐mediated PVT1 playing a key role in regulating OA progression. The LPS‐induced reduction in viability, along with increased apoptosis, inflammatory responses, and collagen degradation in C28/I2 cells, were all reversed by PVT1 depletion. PVT1 exerted its effects by sponging miR‐93‐5p, which in turn regulated the expression of high mobility group protein B1 (HMGB1). Inhibiting miR‐93‐5p negated the protective effects of PVT1 silencing on cell viability, apoptosis, inflammatory responses, and collagen degradation in LPS‐stimulated C28/I2 cells (Meng et al. 2020 ). The upregulation of HMGB1 rescued the increased miR‐93‐5p level‐related apoptosis, inflammation, and collagen degradation of LPS‐stimulated C28/I2 cells (Meng et al. 2020 ).\n\nIn OA exosomes, there was an immense increase in exosomal miR‐372‐3p level and a significant decrease in exosomal hepatocellular carcinoma up‐regulated long non‐coding RNA (HULC) level. Additionally, chondrocytes with elevated levels of HULC in the cytosol exhibited decreased cell death and reduced proliferation compared to normal chondrocytes. In contrast, chondrocytes with high levels of miR‐372‐3p in the cytosol showed lower cell death and increased proliferation (Song et al. 2017 ).\n\nFurthermore, PCGEM1 expression profiling in exosomes extracted from RA synovial fluid varied markedly from those of OA and gout, indicating the prospect of using RA as a biomarker for both diagnosis and treatment (Sun et al. 2024 ). In vivo, BM‐MSC‐EV‐mediated Nuclear Enriched Abundant Transcript 1 (NEAT1) delivery alleviated OA by modulating the miR‐122‐5p/Sesn2/Nrf2 axis. BM‐MSC‐EVs containing NEAT1 bound to activate the Sesn2/Nrf2 axis miR‐122‐5p to protect against OA (Zhang and Jin 2022 ). A study demonstrated that lncRNA LOC102546541, contained within damaged articular chondrocytes (DAC)‐derived EVs, functions as a ceRNA for MMP13 by down‐regulating miR‐632 (Lai et al. 2024 ).\n\nThis down‐regulation enhances MMP1's role in the degradation of the extracellular matrix, thereby contributing to the progression of OA. In the OA rat model, injections of hBM‐MSCs‐EVs into the knee joints reduced joint damage and enhanced trabecular bone characteristics, including volume fraction, number, and connectivity density. In vitro assays showed that hBM‐MSC‐derived EVs preserved the chondrocyte phenotype by promoting collagen type II synthesis and reducing IL‐1β‐induced senescence and apoptosis. Additionally, exosomal long non‐coding RNA MEG‐3 significantly diminished IL‐1β‐induced chondrocyte senescence and apoptosis, suggesting its role in mediating the anti‐OA effects of hBM‐MSC‐derived EV (Jin et al. 2021 ). This research suggests that lncRNA‐containing EVs could play a significant role in OA, potentially serving as biomarkers for diagnosis or targets for new therapeutic strategies. As the field continues to expand, further studies are needed to comprehend the mechanisms through which lncRNAs contribute to OA.\n\nDelivery of EV Circular RNA\n\nCircular RNAs (circRNAs) are emerging as important factors in OA, playing a role in inflammatory responses, cell health (including proliferation, apoptosis, and autophagy), differentiation, and responses to oxidative and mechanical stress. Moreover, many circRNAs work by binding to miRNAs, which are regulators of gene expression. By acting as a sponge, circRNAs can indirectly affect multiple genes and their functions in OA development (Li and Lu 2023 ). For example, through the miR‐1271‐ERG pathway, overexpression of CircSERPINE2 may reduce chondrocyte death while boosting ECM anabolism (Shen et al. 2019 ).\n\nFurthermore, in hMSCs induced to undergo chondrogenesis, overexpression of exosomal circRNA_0001236 increased the expression of Col2a1 and Sox9 but suppressed that of MMP13. Additionally, circRNA_0001236 targeted Sox9 and miR‐3677‐3p in human chondrocytes, functioning as a miR‐3677‐3p sponge. In the DMM mouse model, IA injection of exosomal circRNA_0001236 alleviated OA. Exosomes overexpressing circRNA_0001236 may thereby reduce cartilage degradation, delay the course of OA, and promote cartilage regeneration (Mao et al. 2021 ).\n\nIn vitro studies indicate that MSC‐derived EVs can significantly reduce IL‐1β‐induced chondrocyte apoptosis while promoting chondrocyte migration and proliferation. Furthermore, EVs from MSCs overexpressing circHIPK3 were found to mitigate IL‐1β‐induced chondrocyte damage. Mechanistically, circHIPK3 binds directly to miR‐124‐3p, leading to the upregulation of its target gene, MYH9. These findings suggest that EVs carrying circHIPK3 play a crucial role in enhancing chondrocyte migration and proliferation, as well as preventing cell death via the miR‐124‐3p/MYH9 axis (Li, Liu, et al. 2021 ).\n\nDelivery of Small Molecules\n\nSmall molecules are being extensively studied for their potential to treat OA by targeting inflammation, protecting cartilage, and promoting cartilage repair (Liu, Li, et al. 2023 ). In OA rat models, curcumin has been shown to prevent knee injuries by inhibiting the TLR4/NF‐κB signaling pathway and reducing inflammation. This suggests that curcumin could be a promising therapeutic option for OA treatment (Zhang and Zeng 2019 ).\n\nAdditionally, a clinical trial ( NCT02909621 ) demonstrated the effectiveness of two dosages of bio‐optimized curcuma longa extract (BCL) in treating severe knee OA. BCL was found to be safe and well‐tolerated, with no reports of serious adverse effects. Efficacy analysis showed a rapid and significant reduction in OA‐related knee pain, along with favorable trends in the Patient Global Assessment of Disease Activity (PGADA) and serum levels of an OA biomarker (Henrotin et al. 2019 ). Furthermore, curcumin‐loaded EVs mitigated the catabolic effects of IL‐1β on OA chondrocytes by promoting migration and viability, reducing apoptosis, and activating phosphorylation of p38 MAPK, PI3K/Akt, and Erk1/2, thereby modulating pro‐inflammatory signaling pathways (Li, Stockl, et al. 2021 ).\n\nCurcumin‐EV treatment of OA chondrocytes has been shown to upregulate hsa‐miR‐126‐3p expression, which plays a key role in regulating the anabolic response of OA chondrocytes. EVs present a promising delivery system for curcumin, further supporting its potential in OA therapy (Li, Stockl, et al. 2021 ). The combination of EVs and small molecules marks a significant advancement in targeted drug delivery, offering great potential for developing novel treatments for OA and other diseases. Notably, the small molecule H‐89 has been shown to promote the production of miR‐23b and increase the expression of the chondrocyte marker aggrecan by inhibiting PKA signaling. Further research in this field holds immense promise for therapeutic innovation (Ham et al. 2012 ).\n\nProteins Delivery\n\nWNT3a, a protein, plays a significant role in osteochondral development and repair. Exosome‐assembled WNT3a is efficiently absorbed into the cartilage and helps repair osteochondral lesions (Kovacs et al. 2019 ). Western blotting was used to quantify WNT3a loading onto exosomes, while the EVs were further characterized in vitro using the SUPER8TOPFlash reporter assay and additional validated methods, including assessments of proteoglycan content and cell proliferation (Thomas et al. 2021 ). TCF/Lef reporter mice were employed to assess in vivo pathway activation. Mice with surgically induced large osteochondral defects received injections of Wnt3a‐loaded exosomes into their knees. After 8 weeks, the extent of repair was evaluated histologically. In vitro, WNT3a‐loaded exosomes effectively activated WNT signaling. In vivo, a single injection of these exosomes triggered canonical WNT signaling for at least 1 week and significantly enhanced the repair of osteochondral lesions after 8 weeks. In contrast, recombinant WNT3a failed to stimulate WNT signaling in cartilage (Thomas et al. 2021 ).\n\nMoreover, the impact of TGF‐β on chondrocyte phenotypic stability is investigated and compared with factors involved in cartilage defect repair utilizing MSCs or chondrocytes (Freyria and Mallein‐Gerin 2012 ). BMPs possess a positive impact on cartilage and bone formation. However, the development of BMP therapy for cartilage regeneration has been hindered by several factors, including clinical trial participant eligibility, financial support, the safety of drug delivery carriers, the availability of effective scaffolds, appropriate dosing and timing of administration, and potential adverse effects. To overcome these challenges and enable routine clinical applications in the future, further research is needed (Deng et al. 2018 ). Combining TGF‐β3 and BMP‐6 for chondrogenesis with exosomes as a delivery vehicle shows promise as a novel treatment for injured cartilage (Yoo et al. 2022 ). Overall, this combination strategy has the potential to be a more innovative and effective strategy for treating injured cartilage compared to the traditional method. Figure 8 outlines the role of EVs in delivering therapeutic cargo and small molecules involved in EV‐mediated OA therapy.\n\nAnti‐Inflammatory and Immunomodulatory Functions of EVs\n\nAnti‐Inflammatory Activity of EVs\n\nJoint inflammation is a key contributor to several diseases, including OA. In OA, inflammation can be triggered by factors such as biomechanical stress, which is essential in the disease's progression. Chemokines, cytokines, and MMPs produced by synoviocytes, chondrocytes, and infiltrating immune cells orchestrate this inflammatory response. These molecules are essential for controlling joint anabolism and catabolism; signaling pathways such as NFκB, MAPK, PI3K/AKT, prostacyclin, and nitric oxide govern their expression. These pathways, in turn, amplify the inflammatory response, leading to further release of inflammatory mediators.\n\nOne of the critical outcomes is the activation of collagenase‐like MMP‐13, which degrades the extracellular matrix, thereby altering the anatomical and physiological functions of the joint (Chow and Chin 2020 ). EVs have demonstrated significant anti‐inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects in the progression and treatment of OA (You et al. 2023 ). For example, MSC‐miR‐21‐containing EVs have demonstrated higher therapeutic potential than MSCs alone by reducing systemic inflammation in a rat knee model of OA by suppressing the ERK1/2 pathway (Morente‐Lopez et al. 2022 ).\n\nAdditionally, a study found that EVs derived from SMSCs increased anabolic gene expression and decreased catabolic markers in OA chondrocytes in vitro. In vivo, rats treated with these EVs showed lower Osteoarthritis Research Society International (OARSI) scores, higher levels of collagen type II alpha 1, and reduced matrix metalloproteinase‐13 compared to control groups. Furthermore, the treatment resulted in decreased serum pro‐inflammatory cytokines, demonstrating systemic anti‐inflammatory potential (You et al. 2023 ).\n\nHuman UCMSC‐derived EVs exhibit strong immunomodulatory and anti‐inflammatory effects. These EVs deliver therapeutic proteins and modulate the PI3K‐Akt signaling pathway via miRNAs, promoting M2 macrophage polarization and the expression of anti‐inflammatory cytokines such as IL‐10. As a result, they reduce inflammation‐related factors in IL‐1β‐induced OA chondrocytes (Li, Yan, et al. 2022 ). Moreover, MSC‐derived EVs loaded with miR‐3960 inhibit chondrocyte injury and reduce IL‐1β‐induced inflammatory responses and extracellular matrix degradation by downregulation of PHLDA2 and affecting the SDC1/Wnt/β‐catenin pathway (Ye et al. 2022 ). Bovine milk‐derived EVs have also shown promise in protecting the cartilage in OA patients by directly affecting chondrocytes. These EVs carry TGF‐β and miR‐148a, crucial regulators for maintaining chondrocyte homeostasis and preventing cartilage destruction (Pieters et al. 2022 ). EVs' broad availability, minimal immune rejection, and robust immunomodulatory and anti‐inflammatory properties make them a valuable tool in OA treatment.\n\nMSC‐EV secreted factors and bioactive molecules have been shown to have immunomodulatory and regenerative effects (An et al. 2023 ; Harrell et al. 2019 ). IFP‐MSC exosomes have a manifest immunomodulatory profile; macrophages exposed to IFP‐MSC exosomes have been shown to control proliferation and inflammation, which affect synoviocytes and macrophage functionality in inflammatory conditions in vitro (Kouroupis et al. 2022 ). Moreover, IFP‐MSC acquire a potent immunomodulatory phenotype and actively degrade substance P via neutral endopeptidase CD10 (neprilysin) which has its immunomodulatory therapeutic effects largely exerted via its CD10‐bound small EVs (IFP‐MSCs EVs) by attenuating synoviocyte pro‐inflammatory activation and articular cartilage degradation in vivo (Kouroupis et al. 2023 ). Thus, IFP‐MSC EVs can be used as an alternative approach to treating synovitis, IFP fibrosis, articular cartilage degradation, and potentially (Liebmann et al. 2024 ).\n\nImmunomodulatory Function of EVs\n\nFindings from a variety of literature suggest that EVs, which are produced by immune and non‐immune cells, can be crucial for modulating immunity (Robbins et al. 2016 ; Robbins and Morelli 2014 ; Tofino‐Vian et al. 2018 ). Endogenous EVs, produced by various cell types and circulating throughout the body, can modulate immune responses through specific and non‐specific mechanisms. For example, 12‐lipoxygenase in platelet‐derived EVs can travel to mast cells, generating the pro‐resolving mediator lipoxin A4, which helps reduce inflammatory responses (Tang et al. 2010 ).\n\nEVs expressing CD63 and immunoregulatory miRNAs (miR‐30a, −223, −92a) have been identified in bovine milk (Arntz et al. 2015 ). Oral administration of bovine milk‐derived EVs led to a delayed onset of CIA, reduced cartilage pathology and bone marrow inflammation, and decreased levels of serum monocyte chemoattractant protein‐1, IL‐6, and anti‐collagen IgG2a. Additionally, there was a reduction in splenic Th1 (Tbet) and Th17 (RORγt) mRNA expression (Arntz et al. 2015 ).\n\nUnderstanding the complex interactions between MSCs and immune cells can provide insights into their immunomodulatory properties. MSCs exert their effects primarily through paracrine mechanisms and cell‐to‐cell communication, largely due to their ability to secrete soluble molecules and release EVs into the extracellular environment. Numerous studies have highlighted the importance of MSC‐induced direct cell contact in immunosuppression, as well as the role of adhesion molecules such as vascular cell adhesion molecule‐1 and intercellular adhesion molecule‐1 (Quaedackers et al. 2009 ; Ren et al. 2010 ). Additionally, MSC‐derived EVs have been shown to support tissue regeneration, modulate immune responses, and reduce inflammation (Ren et al. 2010 ).\n\nThe administration of murine MSC‐EVs has been shown to alleviate RA symptoms in the mouse CIA model (Cosenza et al. 2017 ). In this study, murine MSC‐EVs had comparable functional effects in vitro, including restoring chondrocyte homeostasis, protecting against apoptosis, and promoting macrophage polarization toward an anti‐inflammatory phenotype. Pigs with bovine serum albumin‐induced synovitis responded positively to IA injection of EVs derived from porcine BM‐MSCs, as evidenced by decreased levels of TNFα expression and synovial lymphocyte count (Casado et al. 2017 ). These EVs effectively inhibited the T cell response triggered by the antigen; they might be utilized as a therapeutic approach to treat T cell‐mediated diseases such as RA. Furthermore, MSC‐derived microvesicles carry specific miRNAs that may be transported to target cells (Collino et al. 2010 ) and presumably have immunomodulatory effects on arthritic disorders, as well as ribonucleoproteins implicated in the intracellular trafficking of RNAs (Vicente et al. 2016 ).\n\nTolerogenic dendritic cell‐derived exosomes (TolDex) have demonstrated potential as RA treatments; however, due to poor in vivo distribution following systemic delivery, their clinical application has been constrained (Kim et al. 2005 ). In this context, Lee et al. developed a stimuli‐responsive TolDex capable of inducing lesion‐specific immunoregulation in RA (Lee et al. 2021 ). The authors engineered TolDex to respond to ROS, a physiological trigger in the RA microenvironment, by hydrophobically integrating a thioketal (TK) linker‐embedded PEG onto its surface. When ROS levels increase, the PEG detaches, allowing ROS‐responsive TolDex (TKDex) to be more easily taken up by activated immune cells. Specifically, TolDex and TKDex inhibited CD40 in mature dendritic cells (mDCs) and modulated the release of pro‐inflammatory cytokines, including IL‐6 and TNF‐α (Lee et al. 2021 ).\n\nPEG enhanced TKDex's accumulation in the joints and extended its circulation time after intravenous injection in a collagen‐induced arthritis (CIA) animal model. Moreover, in CIA mice, TKDex increased TGF‐β, reduced IL‐6 levels, and stimulated CD4 + CD25 + Foxp3+ regulatory T cells. Overall, ROS‐responsive TolDex shows potential as an effective therapeutic agent for RA. Additionally, the transplantation of iPS‐MSC‐Exos protects against femoral head osteonecrosis by promoting local angiogenesis and reducing bone loss, likely through activation of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway in endothelial cells (Liu et al. 2017 ). Additionally, in an ovariectomized rat model, iPS‐MSC‐Exos combined with β‐TCP scaffolds have been shown to enhance angiogenesis and osteogenesis, promoting bone regeneration in critical‐sized calvarial defects (Qi et al. 2016 ).\n\nCurrent Strategies for EV Delivery in OA Therapy\n\nIntra‐Articular Injection ( IA )\n\nIA injections remain the most widely utilized method for delivering cell‐based and regenerative therapies. For example, PRP—a concentrate of platelets and regenerative factors derived from a patient's blood—is frequently administered via IA injection. Similarly, conventional MSC therapies have commonly employed IA delivery. Unlike MSCs, EVs are largely donor‐independent and can be produced under strict good manufacturing practice (GMP) conditions with standardized quality control measures. Additionally, the use of EVs mitigates the risk of tumorigenicity inherent in live‐cell therapies, offering a safer and more scalable alternative for clinical applications (Jones et al. 2024 ). OA has consistently demonstrated its safety and practicality in clinical studies involving IA MSC injections for knee (Di Matteo et al. 2019 ; Wang and Cao 2014 ). Moreover, this treatment approach has shown potential to improve clinical outcomes, including enhancements in the Knee Society Score (KSS) and OA‐specific assessments (Jo et al. 2017 ), though also contributing to limited relief of knee pain (Garay‐Mendoza et al. 2018 ; Phinney and Pittenger 2017 ). Several studies have demonstrated the therapeutic potential of IA injection of hADSC‐sEVs (Woo et al. 2020 ), hESC‐EVs (Wang et al. 2017 ; Zhang et al. 2016 ), UC‐MSC‐EVs (Yan and Wu 2020 ) in promoting cartilage regeneration and slowing the progression of OA.\n\nIn in vivo experiments, isolated EVs were injected at a concentration of 10 10 particles/ml in saline IA into the knee joint of the animal model 14 –and 21 days post‐surgery (Forteza‐Genestra et al. 2024 ; Wang et al. 2020 ). The use of EV‐rich PRP resulted in greater cartilage repair and more effective suppression of OA compared to IA injections of activated PRP alone in in vivo rat models (Liu et al. 2019 ). When comparing mesenchymal EVs to platelet‐derived EVs, the latter demonstrated greater efficacy in preventing OA relapse in rat models (Forteza‐Genestra et al. 2024 ). Although MSC‐derived EVs show promise as a therapeutic approach, IA injections of these EVs alone have exhibited low bioavailability and a short half‐life (Yang et al. 2021 ; Yin et al. 2022 ). Therefore, MSC‐EV therapy is warranted to advance through Phase I and II clinical trials to evaluate its safety and efficacy in the treatment of OA.\n\nHydrogel or Scaffold Systems\n\nEVs could also be loaded into hydrogels or bio‐scaffolds such as hyaluronic acid (HA) and surgically implanted IA injection to enhance EVs efficacy in the treatment of OA (Wong et al. 2020 ; Yang et al. 2021 ).\n\nIn 2021, Yang et al. developed an injectable iPSC‐MSC‐derived small EVs (iMSC‐sEVs) delivery platform to improve OA treatment, using a Diels‐Alder crosslinked HA/PEG hydrogel (DAHP) (Yang et al. 2021 ). The DAHP hydrogel, suitable for IA injection and easy to produce, effectively preserved iMSC‐sEVs. Controlled degradation allowed for a prolonged release of the iMSC‐sEVs. In vivo studies suggest that the DAHP hydrogel may enhance the bioavailability and therapeutic efficacy of iMSC‐sEVs in OA treatment.\n\nAnother study demonstrates that while HA alone has limited effects in a rabbit post‐traumatic cartilage lesion model, combining MSC exosomes with HA, administered through three IA injections, promotes sustained and functional cartilage repair (Wong et al. 2020 ). In clinical settings, this combination presents a promising cell‐free treatment option for cartilage loss. A study by Song et al. found that treating tenocytes with tendon‐derived stem cell‐derived exosomes (TDSC‐Exos) enhanced type I collagen production, migration, proliferation, and tendon‐specific marker expression while protecting against serum deprivation and oxidative stress (Song et al. 2022 ). Photopolymerizable hyaluronic acid scaffold loaded with TDSC‐Exos (pHA‐TDSC‐Exos) shows potential as a sustained release mechanism for tendon repair. In vivo studies demonstrated faster tendon healing in rats treated with TDSC‐Exos, with improved histology scores, fiber organization, and biomechanical performance at the injury site. Additionally, miR‐144‐3p, abundant in TDSC‐Exos, targeted AT‐rich interactive domain 1A to promote tenocyte migration and proliferation, further supporting tendon repair in the rat model (Song et al. 2022 ).\n\nMicrospheres or Nanoparticles\n\nMicrospheres, particularly biodegradable ones, play a crucial role in drug delivery. Poly(L‐lactide) (PLLA) is a biodegradable microsphere that degrades through normal cellular metabolism. PLLA has been utilized as a biodegradable drug delivery system for EVs derived from dental pulp, enabling controlled EV release for bone healing (Swanson et al. 2020 ). Adhering the EVs to the PLLA scaffold helped maintain a sustained release over a longer period (Swanson et al. 2020 ). A bio‐glass nanomaterial scaffold was developed using gelatin methacrylate/nanoclay hydrogel for loading small EVs from various sources. The results demonstrated that gelatin methacrylate enabled a prolonged, sustained release of EVs by targeting the AKT signaling pathway (Hu et al. 2020 , 2022 ; Paul et al. 2016 ). Figure 9 illustrates the potential delivery methods for EVs to maximize therapeutic efficacy. Additionally, Table 1 summarizes the applications of EVs in OA treatment.\n\nTherapeutic Potential of EVs in Preclinical and Clinical Perspectives\n\nEVs have recently emerged as a promising cell‐free therapeutic strategy, demonstrating regenerative potential across various organ systems. Numerous preclinical and clinical investigations are currently underway, marking a crucial transition from laboratory research to clinical application (Huang et al. 2023 ). Notably, early therapeutic implementations of EVs have been particularly prominent in aesthetic and dermatological medicine, attributed to their potent regenerative and reparative capabilities (Prasai et al. 2022 ). Studies have shown that human UCMSC‐EVs and ADMSC‐EVs exhibit significant efficacy in promoting wound healing and skin regeneration (An et al. 2021 ; Zhang et al. 2021 ). These effects are primarily mediated through anti‐inflammatory, antioxidant, pro‐proliferative, and matrix remodeling activities. Additionally, EVs derived from drug‐preconditioned cells have been shown to stimulate local angiogenesis, thereby improving blood flow and nutrient delivery at wound sites (Hu, Tao, et al. 2021 ; Qiu et al. 2020 ; Yu et al. 2020 ). The mechanisms underlying EV‐mediated skin regeneration share striking similarities with those involved in cartilage repair, suggesting potential translational insights for developing EV‐based therapeutics in OA treatment.\n\nThe potential of MSC‐EVs in cartilage repair was evaluated through the analysis of 13 preclinical animal studies involving a total of 434 subjects, predominantly mice and rats (378, 87.1%), with a smaller proportion of rabbits (56, 12.9%) (Tan et al. 2021 ). These findings demonstrated the effectiveness of MSC‐EVs in promoting cartilage regeneration, evidenced by enhanced chondrocyte proliferation, improved ECM remodeling, and better histological scores. In addition, MSC‐EVs have shown promise as drug delivery agents. For example, PRP‐derived EVs loaded with berberine (PRP‐EVs‐ber) significantly promoted the proliferation and chondrogenic differentiation of BM‐MSCs in vitro. This formulation also enhanced BMSC migration and upregulated key ECM markers such as collagen type II, SOX9, and aggrecan. Another study demonstrated that PRP‐EVs‐ber treatment activates the Wnt/β‐catenin signaling pathway, resulting in the upregulation of key chondrogenic markers and reinforcing its therapeutic potential in cartilage tissue engineering (Dong et al. 2022 ). Numerous preclinical studies have evaluated the therapeutic potential of EVs for OA using a range of animal models, including mice (Cosenza et al. 2017 ), rats (Jin et al. 2021 ; Tang et al. 2021 ; Warmink et al. 2023 ), rabbits (Oh et al. 2020 ), and micropigs (Zhang, Wong, et al. 2022 ).\n\nSeveral clinical trials have been initiated to investigate the therapeutic potential of EVs for OA (S. Huang et al. 2023 ). For instance, a Phase I clinical trial ( NCT05060107 ) involving 10 patients with knee OA assessed the safety and efficacy of exosomes derived from allogeneic mesenchymal stromal cells. Similarly, another Phase I trial ( NCT04223622 ) enrolled 24 patients with knee OA to evaluate AMSC‐derived EVs. In a Phase II trial ( NCT05261360 ), exosomes isolated from synovial fluid MSCs were administered to 30 patients suffering from degenerative meniscal injury, marking a step forward in the translational application of EV‐based therapies. UCMSC‐EVs have also been tested in two trials for knee OA: one involving 12 patients ( NCT04719793 ) and another large‐scale study including 168 patients ( NCT04711304 ); these trials underline the growing interest in cell‐free therapeutic strategies using MSC‐EVs for cartilage and joint regeneration, highlighting their potential as safe and effective alternatives to traditional stem cell therapies.\n\nA meta‐analysis evaluating the efficacy of IA injection of stem cell–derived EVs in animal models of OA demonstrated significant therapeutic benefits (Kong et al. 2024 ). These included improved histological outcomes, reduced osteophyte formation, increased chondrocyte counts, pain alleviation, and regulation of key genes involved in cartilage maintenance. The findings provide compelling preclinical evidence supporting the potential of exosome‐based therapy for OA. However, the authors highlight substantial heterogeneity across studies and underscore the need for standardized protocols and further investigation, particularly in larger animal models to enable successful translation into clinical practice (Kong et al. 2024 ).\n\nA study reports the development, characterization, and preclinical evaluation of small EVs (sEVs) derived from UC‐MSCs as a potential therapy for OA (Figueroa‐Valdés et al. 2025 ). A GMP‐compliant process was established to produce clinical‐grade, well‐characterized sEVs with consistent molecular cargo. IA injection of sEVs in an OA mouse model promoted hyaline cartilage regeneration, as confirmed by histological and micro‐computed tomography of X‐ray (μCT) analyses. The sustained detection of sEVs within the knee joint supported their local retention and safety. Preclinical results demonstrated efficient cellular uptake, anti‐inflammatory effects via macrophage polarization, and both chondroprotective and osteoprotective properties. These findings lay the groundwork for an ongoing Phase I clinical trial investigating sEV‐based therapy for knee OA. In summary, MSC‐EVs have demonstrated safety and efficacy and may offer a promising alternative to traditional surgical interventions. Their potential merits further exploration through larger, well‐controlled clinical trials to validate therapeutic outcomes and support clinical translation.\n\nChallenges and Future Directions\n\nOA remains a major clinical challenge, particularly among the elderly. EVs have emerged as promising agents for cell‐free therapy, demonstrating considerable potential in promoting chondrocyte proliferation and migration, thereby supporting cartilage repair.\n\nEVs possess substantial potential in regenerative medicine and therapeutic applications, yet several challenges limit their widespread clinical implementation (Huang et al. 2023 ). These include the limited availability of reliable parental cell sources, the absence of standardized and cost‐effective protocols for EV isolation that ensure consistent yield, purity, and biological activity, and the lack of efficient and reproducible drug‐loading strategies. In addition, the development of robust systems for long‐term storage and transport is still insufficient, and concerns continue regarding the in vivo safety and immunogenicity of EV‐based therapy.\n\nSeveral studies have compared the therapeutic efficacy of stem cells and their EVs to assess EVs capacity as a cell‐free therapy. One meta‐analysis demonstrated comparable benefits between stem cell transplants and secretome treatments in preclinical models of cartilage defects (Muhammad et al. 2019 ). Oh et al. however, reported that although ADSCs promoted cartilage regeneration, their secretome did not (Oh et al. 2020 ). Conversely, another study demonstrated that exosomes from amniotic fluid stem cells (AFSCs) provided superior pain relief and histological improvement compared to AFSCs in an OA model (Zavatti et al. 2020 ). These findings emphasize the need for optimized EV purification and appropriate cell sourcing to maximize therapeutic outcomes in OA treatment.\n\nTo promote the standardization of EV research and facilitate clinical translation, it is crucial to establish robust and well‐structured systems for EV isolation, purification, and characterization that align with GMP guidelines (Ma, Liu, et al. 2023 ; Skuratovskaia et al. 2021 ). However, utilizing natural EVs has limitations such as insufficient targeting capability and rapid clearance from circulation, which compromise their therapeutic effectiveness (Wu et al. 2022 ). To address these, EVs are frequently modified into engineered forms to enhance their functionality (Gupta et al. 2021 ). One of the most widely used strategies involves drug loading, which can be performed either before or after EV secretion (Huang et al. 2023 ). In the pre‐secretion approach, parental cells are exposed to therapeutic agents using transfection agents that enable the intracellular incorporation of drugs that are subsequently packaged into EVs during their biogenesis. Alternatively, in the more commonly adopted post‐secretion method, EVs are first isolated and purified, after which drugs are directly introduced into the vesicles through electroporation or incubation.\n\nConclusion and Future Perspectives\n\nMSC‐based therapies have been widely investigated and are considered for repairing cartilage defects (De Bari and Roelofs 2018 ; Shimomura et al. 2015 ). MSCs hold significant potential in tissue engineering, but their clinical application is limited by concerns such as immune rejection and tumorigenic risk (Huang et al. 2023 ). The IA administration of MSCs in osteoarthritic knees has demonstrated a favorable safety profile and limited improvement in joint pain and mobility (Chahla et al. 2016 ; Kim, Ha, et al. 2019 ). While the precise mechanisms underlying MSC‐mediated treatment of OA remain to be fully elucidated, accumulating evidence suggests that their therapeutic benefits are largely attributed to paracrine signaling, particularly through the release of EVs (Phinney and Pittenger 2017 ; Toh et al. 2017 ). Biotherapeutic strategies for OA, including cell‐free approaches, have gained significant attention, and EVs are emerging as a superior alternative to MSC therapy for promoting tissue regeneration. While MSCs often face challenges such as low viability and limited persistence in vivo, EVs offer greater stability, reduced immunogenicity, and enhanced potential for early joint mineralization. The regenerative capacity of EVs is largely attributed to their diverse bioactive cargo, which includes membrane and cytosolic proteins, lipids, and a wide range of genetic materials such as mRNAs, miRNAs, siRNAs, lncRNAs, circRNAs, and ribosomal RNAs factors—that collectively facilitate intercellular communication and tissue repair. Recent studies have shown that EVs derived from various MSC sources can promote cartilage regeneration and help slow OA advancement (Muthu et al. 2021 ).\n\nEVs enriched with IL‐10 or derived from IL‐10‐treated dendritic cells demonstrated potent anti‐inflammatory effects upon the periarticular injection (Kim et al. 2005 ). Then, in 2015, MSC‐EVs showed greater therapeutic efficacy in OA treatment than MSCs themselves, as reflected by improved histological outcomes (Heldring et al. 2015 ). This led to the establishment of the groundwork for using EVs in cartilage repair. EVs have shown strong regenerative potential, with multiple studies confirming their safety and efficacy in small animal models (Huang et al. 2023 ). In equine OA models, MSC‐derived EVs (< 200 nm) demonstrated superior activity to MSCs in promoting chondrocyte proliferation, migration, and phenotype maintenance, suggesting their effectiveness in cartilage regeneration and OA delay (Jammes et al. 2023 ).\n\nEVs show significant therapeutic potential, but clinical trials remain limited, particularly in cartilage repair. More robust clinical investigations are needed to evaluate their safety and therapeutic efficacy. Establishing long‐term monitoring systems is essential to assess sustained outcomes and potential side effects. Encouraging progress has been made, but the molecular mechanisms through which EVs contribute to cartilage regeneration remain insufficiently understood and require further study.\n\nTo enhance OA targeting and prolong exosome release in drug delivery, they could be incorporated into natural scaffolds like HA hydrogels or synthetic ones such as PLLA. The EV production and release can be achieved by joint cells such as chondrocytes, synovial fibroblasts, osteoblasts, and tenocytes. In addition, using AI technologies shows promise in EV research in diagnosis precision and treatment monitoring for different diseases; furthermore, AI prediction helps engineered EVs in precision control for drug delivery, which can have an impact on the biological outcomes of targeted cells. Furthermore, by boosting cartilage regeneration, reducing synovitis, and supporting subchondral bone remodeling, stem cell‐derived EVs may safeguard the OA joint from damage. Research on EV functions, underlying mechanisms, and diagnostic/therapeutic applications in OA is still in its early stages, with numerous obstacles remaining before clinical translation. However, with continued technological advancements, EV‐based therapy holds promise for future use in OA treatment.\n\nNumerous studies have investigated EVs using cell‐based and small animal models, but research involving large animals and clinical trials remains limited, thereby constraining the translational potential of EV‐based therapies for OA. As previously discussed, a growing body of in vivo and in vitro evidence has shed light on the therapeutic mechanisms of EVs in OA and cartilage injury, such as reducing chondrocyte apoptosis, mitigating inflammation, and preventing ECM degradation. However, several critical questions remain unanswered. These include identifying the most therapeutically effective EV sources, optimizing isolation and storage methods, determining ideal dosing regimens, routes of administration, and treatment durations, and thoroughly evaluating potential side effects and safety risks. In conclusion, EV‐based therapies mark a transformative advance in cartilage regeneration by harnessing the reparative capabilities of MSCs while offering improved safety and controllability. Future research should focus on scalable manufacturing processes, precision‐targeted delivery systems, and comprehensive clinical validation to realize their clinical potential.\n\nAuthor Contributions\n\nSeif Ehab: conceptualization (equal), data curation (equal), software (supporting), writing – original draft (supporting).
