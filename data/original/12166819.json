  "abstract": "Background: Primary graft dysfunction (PGD) remains a leading cause of early morbidity and mortality in lung transplantation. PGD is characterized by diffuse alveolar damage and the accumulation of extravascular lung water in the transplanted lung.

It is also associated with adverse long-term outcomes, including chronic lung allograft dysfunction and more unfavorable survival. 6 , 8\n\nDonor lung criteria have been established in a consensus document by the International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation (ISHLT). 9 However, donor lungs sustain injuries to varying and unpredictable degrees due to resuscitation maneuvers, mechanical ventilation, aspiration, or embolism. 10 In clinical practice, ideal donor criteria are infrequently met. The etiology of PGD is multifactorial, involving a combination of donor, procedural, and recipient-related factors. Among donor characteristics, cigarette smoking has been identified as a specific risk factor for mild PGD, although not associated with increased mortality. 11 On the recipient side, obesity, pre-transplant lung fibrosis, and pulmonary hypertension are significant risk factors for PGD. 12\n\nImproving the assessment of donor lungs and optimizing donor management protocols are critical strategies for reducing the incidence of PGD. 13 , 14 , 15 In this study, we hypothesize that PGD grade II and III diagnosed within the first 72 hours postoperatively is associated with the adjusted lung weight at procurement.\n\nMaterials and methods\n\nStudy design, participant selection, and data acquisition\n\nThe study was approved by the Swedish Ethical Board (Dnr: 2019-01473) and conducted in compliance with the ISHLT ethics statement. All patients provided informed consent for scientific investigations prior to transplantation. Donation after brain death donor lungs transplanted between January 2014 and May 2021 were identified using the Scandia transplant registry and assessed for eligibility ( Figure 1 ). Exclusion criteria included lung lobe transplantation, the preoperative use of ex vivo lung perfusion (EVLP), and missing lung weight data. The guidelines from the ISHLT for grading PGD were applied. 4 PaO 2 and FiO 2 values were obtained from laboratory records and patient charts. After weaning from mechanical ventilation, FiO 2 was determined using a conversion table reflecting the amount of supplemental oxygen provided. 16 Two experienced cardiothoracic radiologists reassessed all chest X-rays performed within the first 72 hours. In cases where a chest X-ray was unavailable, a plain scout image from a computed tomography scan was utilized.\n\nTransplant procedures\n\nAdhering to a detailed protocol (Suppl), bilateral donor lung weights were measured and recorded following the standard clinical procurement and prior to the retrograde cold Perfadex flush. All measurements were consistently performed using the same digital table scale (GTIN: 04034127162040) on the back table at the donor site. Donor lungs were transported in cold storage on ice. The default surgical technique was sequential bilateral anterolateral thoracotomy without mechanical circulatory support. Perioperative veno-arterial (VA) ECMO support or cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) were used selectively based on recipient hemodynamics ( Table 1 ). A left-sided double-lumen endotracheal tube was used for single-lung ventilation, with lung-protective ventilation strategies employing tidal volumes of 6-8 mL/kg. The insertion of a Swan-Ganz catheter was routine for pulmonary artery pressure monitoring. During lung reperfusion, methylprednisolone (250 mg for each lung) and mannitol (100 mL for each lung) were administered. Anastomosis control was performed by perioperative bronchoscopy.\n\nPostoperative care was provided in the cardiothoracic intensive care unit (CICU), using a restrictive strategy for intravenous fluid administration along with continuous monitoring of perfusion and pulmonary hemodynamics (continuous cardiac output catheter, Edwards Lifesciences, Irvine, CA). Protective ventilation, including tidal volumes of 6-8 mL/kg of predicted body weight, peak pressure <30 cm H 2 O, and PEEP set to a minimum of 5 cm H 2 O (Flow-i; Maquet Critical Care, Solna, Sweden). Institutional protocols for weaning from mechanical ventilation were followed. According to the “Enhanced Recovery After Surgery” guidelines for cardiac surgery, 17 early extubation was defined as occurring within 6 hours postoperatively. Immunosuppression therapy was initiated on the first postoperative day.\n\nLung weight\n\nTo allow standardized comparisons across donors, lung weights were normalized for body size by dividing total bilateral donor lung weight by the donor's body surface area (BSA). BSA was calculated using the DuBois formula: 18 BSA (m²) = 0.007184 × Weight (kg)^0.425 × Height (cm)^0.725. Data were categorized into lower (1st-3rd quartiles) and upper (4th) quartile groups and labeled as \"low-weight\" and \"high-weight,” respectively. Limitations in existing scientific data on donor lung weights justify the decision to compare quartiles within the cohort.\n\nPrimary and secondary outcomes\n\nThe primary outcomes were the incidence of PGD (grades II and III) at 24, 48, and 72 hours following reperfusion of the second lung and length of intensive care unit (ICU) stay. Secondary outcomes included the duration of postoperative mechanical ventilation, pulmonary function assessed by spirometry at hospital discharge, lung oxygenation over the first 72 hours, and mortality within the first year.\n\nStatistical analysis\n\nContinuous variables were reported as mean ± standard deviation or median with IQR, depending on data distribution. The normality was assessed using the Shapiro-Wilk test. Student's t-test was used for normally distributed variables, and the Mann-Whitney U test for non-normally distributed variables. Categorical variables were compared using the chi-square test or Fisher's exact test, as appropriate. Trends across all quartiles were analyzed using the Mantel-Haenszel test for PGD severity and the Jonckheere-Terpstra test for ICU length of stay. Log-transformed values of adjusted donor lung weight were used in a linear regression model to identify variables associated with increased adjusted donor lung weight. Time to extubation and one-year mortality were evaluated using the Kaplan-Meier method, with the log-rank test employed to compare survival curves between groups. Multivariable logistic regression identified independent predictors of PGD. Variables with p < 0.1 in univariable analysis were included in the multivariable model. Results were presented as odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). For PaO 2 /FiO 2 ratios, a repeated measures analysis of variance was employed to assess both the overall differences between the groups over time and to determine any significant interactions between the groups and time points. The PaO 2 /FiO 2 ratio was dependent variable and time (0, 24, 48, and 72 hours) and group (lower quartiles and upper quartile) independent variables. Pairwise comparisons explored differences at individual time points. Statistical significance was set at p < 0.05. Statistical analyses were conducted using IBM® SPSS® Statistics software, Version 29.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY).\n\nResults\n\nPatient demographics\n\nBetween January 2014 and May 2021, 236 bilateral lung transplants were performed at Sahlgrenska University Hospital (Gothenburg, Sweden), with 194 patients meeting all inclusion criteria ( Figure 1 ). The most common indications for transplantation were pulmonary fibrosis (33.0%) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (21.1%; Table 1 ). Recipients ranged in age from 14 to 69 years, with a median age of 51 years. Sequential bilateral anterolateral thoracotomy was performed in 159 patients, with 19 requiring VA ECMO support. Thirty-five procedures were performed using CPB and median sternotomy. Donor lungs were implanted within a median time of 6.8 hours (IQR 5.3-8.1) following procurement.\n\nThe median adjusted donor lung weight for the entire cohort was 376.4 g/m² (IQR: 343.7-411.9 g/m²). In the lower three quartiles ( n = 146), weights ranged from 224.8 to 479.7 g/m², while the upper quartile ( n = 48) ranged from 480.7 to 1030.5 g/m². In CPB cases, bypass duration did not differ significantly between the groups. Similarly, the mean ischemia duration for the second donor lung (the last lung to be transplanted and reperfused) did not differ between groups. The donor mean PaO 2 /FiO 2 ratio at the time of the initial decision to accept the lungs for transplantation was comparable across groups. However, the “high-weight” group exhibited a slightly lower PaO 2 /FiO 2 ratio just before donor sternotomy ( p = 0.065).\n\nPrimary outcomes\n\nA total of 24 patients (12.4%) were diagnosed with PGD grades II or III, including 13 (9%) in the “low-weight” group and 11 (23%) in the “high-weight” group ( p = 0.020; Table 2 ). The median length of stay in the ICU was 3 days (IQR 2-5) for the “low-weight” group and 5 days (IQR 2-10) for the “high-weight” group ( p = 0.026).\n\nThe trend across all four consecutive quartiles of adjusted donor lung weight was significant for PGD severity ( p = 0.021), but not for ICU length of stay ( p = 0.064, Table 3 ).\n\nSecondary outcomes\n\nA significantly higher proportion of patients in the \"low-weight\" group achieved successful extubation within the first 72 postoperative hours ( p = 0.048; Figure 2 ). The mean duration of initial postoperative mechanical ventilation was 5 hours (IQR 3-14) in the “low-weight” group compared to 8 hours (IQR 4-33) in the “high-weight” group ( p = 0.076; Table 2 ). When including reintubation and subsequent ventilation runs, the total duration was 6 hours (IQR 3-18) for the “low-weight” group and 11 hours (IQR 4-132) for the “high-weight” group ( p = 0.149). Early extubation 17 was achieved in 82 patients (57%) in the “low-weight” group compared to 20 patients (43%) in the “high-weight” group ( p = 0.095). The duration of postoperative inotropic support was 1 day (IQR 1-3) in the \"low-weight\" group compared to 2 days (IQR 1-5) in the \"high-weight\" group ( p = 0.078).\n\nMeasurement of lung function by spirometry was performed prior to hospital discharge, with a median time of 21 days (IQR 19-26) post-lung transplantation. While there was a difference in forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1,0 ) as a percentage of forced vital capacity between the groups favoring the “low-weight” group [80% (73-88) vs 75% (70-87)], this difference was not statistically significant ( p = 0.075). Furthermore, no significant differences were observed between the groups in terms of percent of predicted vital capacity or FEV 1,0 .\n\nThe multivariate regression analysis ( Table 4 ) identified adjusted donor lung weight ( p = 0.008) and shorter duration of mechanical ventilation prior to aortic cross-clamping in the donor ( p = 0.013) as independent predictors associated with PGD. In a linear regression analysis assessing factors associated with increased adjusted donor lung weight ( Table S1 , Supplements), smoking was identified as the only variable with a statistically significant association.\n\nOne year survival was 91.0% in the “low weight” group and 83.6% in the “high weight” group ( p = 0.371, Figure 3 ). Postoperative mean PaO2/FiO2 ratios differed between the \"high-weight\" and \"low-weight\" groups in separation and trajectory of the curves over time ( p = 0.031), with significant differences at 0, 48, and 72 hours ( Figure 4 ).\n\nDiscussion\n\nThis study identifies a significant association between adjusted donor lung weight and adverse outcomes, including the incidence of PGD grades II and III, as well as prolonged ICU stay. Recipients of heavier donor lungs experienced poorer clinical outcomes, reduced lung oxygenation, and prolonged extubation times within the first 72 hours post-transplant. These findings underscore the potential of donor lung weight as a surrogate marker for EVLW and a predictor of post-transplant complications. Awareness of donor lung weight can enable tailored recipient management strategies, potentially leading to improved patient outcomes.\n\nIn a study by Okamoto et al 19 including 290 lung transplant recipients, 51 of whom received lungs treated with EVLP, the relationship between adjusted lung weight at procurement and the development of PGD grade III was investigated. A significant association was identified between the upper quartile of adjusted lung weight and PGD grade III in the combined cohort. However, this trend did not reach statistical significance in the non-EVLP subgroup ( n = 239), likely due to lower lung weights and PGD risk. 13 Our study excluded EVLP patients and is the first to demonstrate a significant association between adjusted donor lung weight and PGD incidence in non-EVLP cases, which continue to represent the majority of donor lungs. Excluding EVLP cases enhanced data consistency and allowed our findings to better reflect standard transplant procedures, minimizing the confounding effects of EVLP-related factors such as increased EVLW, variable organ quality, and differing treatment protocols. Ultimately, this approach strengthened the observed association between donor lung weight and PGD incidence.\n\nOkamoto et al also reported longer ICU stays for recipients of heavier lungs, aligning with our findings. However, our study is the first to report a reduced rate of successful extubations within the first 72 hours among recipients of heavier donor lungs, consistent with significantly lower PaO 2 /FiO 2 ratios. The prolonged ICU stays observed in the “high-weight” group in our study are likely linked to the increased incidence of PGD, which requires extended durations of mechanical ventilation. Prolonged ventilation, in turn, increases the risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia, delays patient mobilization, and negatively impacts cognitive recovery. 20 , 21\n\nInterestingly, in the study by Okamoto et al, several patients improved from PGD grade III to grade II between 48 and 72 hours, likely due to effective postoperative treatment. Recognizing this dynamic nature of PGD grading, we used a composite measure of PGD grades II and III within the first 72 hours. This approach is further justified by the similar mortality risks associated with PGD grades II and III, as well as their shared link to an increased risk of Bronchiolitis Obliterans Syndrome, 8 a significant long-term complication.\n\nThe association between increased donor lung weight and a higher incidence of PGD supports the hypothesis that heavier lungs have elevated levels of EVLW. 22 This excess fluid adds to the perioperative ischemia-reperfusion injury edema and may also be a sign of more extended capillary damage. 23 The autonomic storm associated with brain death induces neurogenic pulmonary edema and a surge in catecholamine release, 5 which subsequently triggers pulmonary and systemic inflammatory responses. The inflammatory response to brain herniation varies due to genetic factors, and the balance of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines predicts recipient 30-day mortality. 24 , 25 Severe neurogenic pulmonary edema in donor lungs intensifies reperfusion injury and PGD risk in animal models. 26 During donor management, the combined effects of inflammation and hemodynamic disturbances compromise the integrity of the capillary barrier, promoting accumulation of EVLW. Excessive volume resuscitation for vasoplegic vasomotor center dysfunction exacerbates the effect. Notably, the degree of lung weight gain observed during EVLP predicts lung suitability and post-transplant outcomes after 1 hour of EVLP. 27 This finding likely reflects the persistence of severe capillary damage during donor care.\n\nDonor care\n\nOur findings emphasize the need for tailored strategies to manage heavier donor lungs, including careful fluid management and appropriate use of diuretics to prevent fluid imbalance. 28 Optimization of mechanical ventilation, including prone positioning for donors with hypoxemia, may improve ventilation-perfusion matching at allocation and reduce atelectasis, enhancing lung suitability for transplantation. 29 In a group of postoperative cardiac surgery patients, 30 , 31 a brief period in the prone position combined with a mild recruitment maneuver effectively resolved atelectasis, leading to improved lung oxygenation and more homogeneous ventilation. This approach may also be viable for lung donors who cannot tolerate prolonged prone positioning.\n\nPostoperative care\n\nLike donor management, negative fluid balance in postoperative care may minimize complications. 28 Hoetzenecker et al 32 reported a reduced PGD incidence with routine intraoperative ECMO, particularly citing potential benefits in heavier lungs. However, the absence of a comparison group limits causal interpretation, and a subsequent registry analysis found that ECMO increased PGD risk. 33\n\nThe multivariate regression analysis identified adjusted donor lung weight as an independent determinant of increased PGD risk, consistent with the findings of Okamoto et al. 19 Surprisingly, the analysis indicated that increased donor time on mechanical ventilation appeared to reduce the risk of PGD. This unexpected finding suggests that extended periods of mechanical ventilation may mitigate potential complications in the recipient. Possibly by removal of excess fluids from the donor lungs, enabling the resolution of pulmonary edema. Additionally, it may provide time for the donor to transition past the initial adrenergic storm typically associated with brain death. 26 Moreover, extended mechanical ventilation may allow for optimization of ventilator settings, thereby improving lung function before procurement.\n\nThe PaO 2 /FiO 2 ratio is a widely accepted variable for assessing donor lung quality, with values greater than 300 mmHg considered favorable. 1 , 9 , 10 In this study, the donor PaO 2 /FiO 2 ratio, measured at the time of decision as well as pre- and post-sternotomy, showed no significant differences between the \"low-weight\" and \"high-weight\" groups. This suggests that the PaO 2 /FiO 2 ratio is not a reliable surrogate marker for lung-capillary damage in this context. McGiffin et al 34 has previously demonstrated that the donor PaO 2 /FiO 2 ratio alone is an insufficient predictor, leading to overly cautious decision-making and excessive rejection of donor lungs.\n\nA significant difference was observed between groups in the postoperative PaO₂/FiO₂ ratio trajectory and specific time points. The “high-weight” group exhibited lower initial PaO₂/FiO₂ ratios, which remained lower and demonstrated less improvement over time. These findings align with the higher incidence of PGD in heavier lungs, as the PaO₂/FiO₂ ratio is a key determinant of PGD severity.\n\nAlthough the reported combined incidence of PGD grades II and III is typically around 15%-30%, 7 it was 12.4% in our cohort. This difference is unlikely due to patient selection, as most exclusions were related to missing lung weight data. Instead, it may be attributed to the relatively small cohort size, which increases susceptibility to random variation. Additionally, our strict criteria for diagnosing and grading PGD may have contributed to underdiagnosis, particularly in cases when clinicians, relying on clinical judgment, managed patients with low PaO 2 /FiO 2 ratios without conducting immediate radiological tests. Furthermore, while our center’s surgical and perioperative care generally aligns with standard practices at larger transplant centers, certain aspects may differ. For instance, most procedures were performed without extracorporeal support, which likely reduced the inflammatory burden. 33 Furthermore, the use of thoracic epidural anesthesia 35 in patients without extracorporeal support may have reduced lung edema by enhancing endothelial integrity. 36\n\nThe association between heavier donor lungs and increased PGD did not translate into significantly reduced 1-year survival despite the established link between PGD and early mortality. The absence of a significant difference in one-year mortality may stem from the lower-than-expected incidence of PGD grades II and III in our cohort.\n\nLimitations and future directions\n\nThe retrospective nature of the analysis limits causal inferences. In addition, we did not account for all potential confounding factors that could influence PGD risk and ICU stay duration. Moreover, the unexpectedly low overall incidence of PGD may limit the robustness of comparisons and affect the interpretation of outcomes.\n\nIn designing the study, we carefully considered whether to adjust lung weight for body height or BSA. Given the lack of conclusive evidence favoring one approach over the other, we ultimately selected BSA due to its broader representation of body size and its widespread use in medical research.\n\nComparing the upper lung weight quartile to the combined lower three quartiles was intended to maintain statistical power, simplify interpretation, and align with our aim to identify whether high lung weights are associated with increased PGD incidence. Focusing on a clearly defined high-risk group was considered more clinically relevant than examining incremental differences across all quartiles. This approach is further supported by the observed trend when analyzing quartiles as a continuum.\n\nFuture prospective studies should validate these findings and investigate interventions aimed at reducing donor lung weight. This includes optimizing donor management and refining the prediction of transplant suitability, 27 potentially through the expanded use of EVLP. Incorporating prone positioning for donor lungs, with or without EVLP, and exploring the addition of hemofiltration are promising approaches to expand the donor pool. 29 , 37 , 38 , 39 , 40 In situ normothermic regional perfusion for direct procurement and preservation may reduce the incidence of PGD. 41 Furthermore, investigating the long-term impact of donor lung weight on outcomes such as chronic lung allograft dysfunction and overall survival is desirable.\n\nConclusion\n\nOur findings highlight the importance of considering adjusted donor lung weight in the selection and management of lung transplant recipients. The significant association between higher donor lung weight and increased PGD risk suggests that preoperative donor management strategies and selection of suitable lungs, as well as postoperative care tailored to recipients of heavier lungs, are crucial in optimizing outcome. Further studies with larger cohorts are needed to confirm and understand these findings.\n\nFunding\n\nFor this project, the authors received research grants from the Sahlgrenska University Hospital foundations (SU-961030, SU-971601), The Gothenburg Society of medicine (GLS-972306, GLS-999058), and the Swedish Heart-Lung Foundation (HjLfonden 20240788).\n\nFinancial Disclosure Statement\n\nOn behalf of all authors of this manuscript, the authors confirm that none of the authors have any financial relationships or potential conflicts of interest to disclose in connection with this study.\n\nDeclaration of Competing Interest\n\nThe authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.",
