  "title": "Number of lymph nodes retrieved in patients with locally advanced rectal cancer after total neoadjuvant therapy: post-hoc analysis from the STELLAR trial",
  "abstract": "Background: The current gold standard for extraperitoneal locally advanced rectal cancer is total neoadjuvant therapy (TNT) followed by total mesorectal excision. This research explored the number of lymph nodes in patients with locally advanced rectal cancer after TNT and its correlation with survival.\n\nMaterials and Methods: This is a post-hoc analysis based on the STELLAR trial, including patients with locally advanced rectal cancer from 16 tertiary centres who were randomized for short-term radiotherapy followed by chemotherapy (TNT group) or long-term concurrent chemotherapy group followed by total mesorectal excision between 2015 and 2018. This lymph node-related analysis is based on the TNT group. Subgroups were differentiated based on the lymph node harvest (below the median number: limited lymphadenectomy group, and greater than/equal to the median number: extended lymphadenectomy group). The primary outcomes were overall survival and disease-free survival (DFS). Correlations with clinical/pathological variables, lymphadenectomy categories and use of adjuvant chemotherapy were explored.\n\nResults: Among the 451 patients enrolled in the STELLAR trial, 227 patients (50.3%) were assigned to the TNT group, including 29.5% females. The median number of lymph nodes retrieved in the TNT group was 11.0. Patients in the limited lymphadenectomy subgroup exhibited worse overall survival than those with extended lymphadenectomy (HR 2.95 (95% c.i. 1.47 to 5.92), P = 0.001). The overall survival was similar in the ypN0-limited and ypN1-extended subgroups (HR 0.38 (95% c.i. 0.11 to 1.30), P = 0.109). Adjuvant chemotherapy was associated with better overall survival and DFS than no adjuvant chemotherapy overall ( P < 0.001) and in the limited lymphadenectomy subgroup ( P < 0.001). However, there was no significant difference in overall survival or DFS with or without adjuvant chemotherapy in the extended lymphadenectomy subgroup ( P = 0.887 and P = 0.192, respectively).\n\nConclusion: In the STELLAR trial, the median number of lymph nodes harvested was 11. In patients with limited lymphadenectomy, the use of adjuvant therapy after TNT was beneficial and correlated with better prognosis compared with patients who did not receive adjuvant chemotherapy.",

  "full_text": "Introduction\n\nColorectal cancer (CRC) is the second most common cause of cancer-related death worldwide 1 . Rectal cancer in particular accounts for nearly 30% of patients with CRC, with a higher incidence among males 2 . For patients who have undergone curative resection, accurate identification of lymph node metastasis (LNM) is crucial for improved prognostic assessment and treatment decision-making 3 . Identifying the optimal number of lymph nodes (LNs) is essential for accurate nodal staging.\n\nCurrently, the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines recommend retrieving a minimum of 12 LNs 3 . However, these recommendations are suitable only for colon cancer and cannot be applied for rectal cancer, particularly for those patients receiving neoadjuvant therapy (NAT). Meanwhile, the first-line standard treatment for mid- and distal locally advanced rectal cancer (LARC) is total neoadjuvant therapy (TNT) followed by total mesorectal excision (TME) 3–5 . However, data on the optimal number of LNs to retrieve in patients with LARC after TNT are lacking.\n\nTo better address these issues, a post-hoc analysis based on a multicentre, open-label, randomized phase III trial—namely, the STELLAR study—was conducted. The aim of this study was to explore the optimal number of LNs in rectal cancer patients undergoing TME after TNT and its correlation with survival.\n\nMethods\n\nStudy design and participants\n\nThis study was conducted according to the ethical principles for medical research involving human participants stated in the Declaration of Helsinki and approved by the Institutional Review Board of the National Cancer Center/Cancer Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College. All patients provided written informed consent, and the protocol was approved by the local ethics committee and registered at Clinical-Trials.gov (identifier: NCT02533271 ). All participating centres were tertiary hospitals in different regions of China. This study was reported following the strengthening the reporting of cohort, cross-sectional and case–control studies in surgery (STROCSS) reporting guidelines 6 .\n\nThe STELLAR study enrolled patients with mid- and distal-LARC with biopsy-proven adenocarcinoma. The inclusion criteria were as follows: 18–70 years of age, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) score 0–1, clinical primary tumour (cT) stage 3–4 and/or regional lymph node (N) positivity without distant metastases, white blood cell count ≥ 3.5 × 10 9 /l, haemoglobin ≥ 100 g/l, platelet count ≥ 100 × 10 9 /l and creatinine ≤ 1.0× the upper limit of normal. The exclusion criteria were as follows: recurrent disease, a medical contraindication to the planned treatment or MRI, or a second primary malignancy. All patients underwent pretreatment and post-treatment radiological assessments centrally and independently by three radiologists.\n\nPatients were randomly assigned to short-term radiotherapy followed by chemotherapy (TNT group) or long-term concurrent chemotherapy (CRT group). Random assignment was carried out by computer-generated allocation stratified by location, clinical stage, and mesorectal fascia (MRF) status. A telephone call to an independent central trial office was used to ensure blindness from the random assignment. Those in the TNT group underwent short-term radiotherapy (5 Gy × 5) followed by four cycles of CAPOX (oxaliplatin (130 mg/m 2 , once a day, on day 1) and capecitabine (1000 mg/m 2 , twice a day, from day 1 to day 14)) at 7–14 days after the completion of radiotherapy. Those in the CRT group underwent treatment with 50 Gy in 25 fractions over 5 weeks concurrently with capecitabine (825 mg/m 2 , twice a day). Postoperative chemotherapy comprised two cycles of CAPOX in the TNT group or six cycles of CAPOX in the CRT group. The TME procedure was performed in both groups 6–8 weeks after preoperative therapy. Acute adverse events (AEs) were codified using the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI-CTCAE) v4.0.\n\nData collection and follow-up\n\nPelvic MRI was required to identify the T/N stage, MRF status and extramural vascular invasion (EMVI) status appropriately. The MRF was defined as the fascia surrounding the mesorectum. In addition, chest CT and liver MRI/CT were performed to rule out metastatic disease. The distance from the lower pole of the tumour to the anal verge was measured during the colonoscopy examination. Pathological staging was performed by examining the surgical specimen. R1 resection was defined by the presence of tumour tissue in the surgical margin. A pathological complete response (pCR) was defined as the absence of tumour cells at the primary site and in regional LNs. The collected patient characteristics included age, sex, ECOG score, MRI T/N stage, clinical stage, MRF involvement, EMVI status, distance to anal verge, severe AEs, extent of resection, MRI ypT/N stage, adjuvant chemotherapy (ACT) information, and the number of LNs/positive LNs (pLNs).\n\nOutcomes of interest\n\nThe primary outcome of this study was overall survival (OS), defined as the time from randomization to death due to any cause. The second outcome of this study was disease-free survival (DFS), defined as the time from randomization to the first locoregional recurrence. Follow-up examinations were scheduled every 3 months during the first 2 years, every 6 months for the next 3 years, and annually thereafter.\n\nLN subgroups\n\nA restricted cubic spline (RCS) function was applied to present linear or non-linear prognostic profiles of LNs retrieved and to identify the optimal cut-off value. Subgroups were defined based on a limited LN retrieval (below the median value) or extended LN retrieval (greater/equal than the median value).\n\nStatistical analysis\n\nCategorical variables were presented as absolute frequencies and percentages and were compared using Fisher’s exact test or the χ 2 test. Continuous variables were reported as medians with interquartile ranges (25–75th percentiles) and were compared using the non-parametric Mann–Whitney U test. The distributions of stage changes after preoperative treatment and the number of LNs retrieved were plotted in bar charts. The differences in the number of LNs retrieved between different subgroups were also illustrated through bar charts. Survival was analysed using the Kaplan–Meier (K-M) method and the log-rank test and Cox regression model. The false discovery rate (FDR) method was used to adjust the values of P , considering the sample size, in order to reduce the probability of false positives and demonstrate the validity of the subgroup analysis.\n\nMultivariate Cox proportional hazards regression analysis was used to mitigate confounding biases and adjust the parameters. Statistical tests were carried out at a two-sided significance level of 0.05. All the statistical analyses and data visualizations were performed using R 4.2.1 software.\n\nThis study was conducted according to the ethical principles for medical research involving human participants stated in the Declaration of Helsinki and approved by the Institutional Review Board of the National Cancer Center/Cancer Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College. All patients provided written informed consent, and the protocol was approved by the local ethics committee and registered at Clinical-Trials.gov (identifier: NCT02533271 ).\n\nResults\n\nClinical characteristics\n\nFrom 30 August 2015 to 27 August 2018, a total of 629 patients were screened; 451 underwent TME and had complete statistical data available, and these patients were enrolled in the final analysis. Of these, 227 patients were assigned to the TNT group and 224 patients were assigned to the CRT group ( Fig. 1 ). The clinical characteristics were well balanced between the groups ( Table 1 ). The proportions of females in the TNT and CRT groups were 29.5% and 30.8% respectively. The median age at diagnosis was 55 years in the TNT group and 56 years in the CRT group. The number of LNs retrieved was 11.0 (i.q.r. 7.0–16.0) in the TNT group and 11.0 (i.q.r. 7.0–17.0) in the CRT group.\n\nFigure 2 illustrates the difference in downstaging between the two groups. T downstaging was achieved in 134 (59.0%) patients in the TNT group, representing a significantly greater level of downstaging than that achieved in the CRT group (108 patients, 48.2%; P = 0.027). However, this was not observed in N staging (72.7% and 67.4%, in the TNT and CRT groups respectively).\n\nDistribution of LNs retrieved\n\nThe distributions of LNs retrieved in the TNT and CRT groups are shown in Fig. 3 . The median number of LNs retrieved was 11.0 in both groups. Furthermore, several clinical characteristics were associated with the number of LNs retrieved ( Supplementary Materials , Figs. S1 , S2 ). Fewer LNs were retrieved in patients with LARC who achieved a pCR than those who did not achieve a pCR in the TNT group (8.0 [i.q.r. 4.3–13.0] versus 12.0 [i.q.r. 8.0–16.0], P = 0.024). The same result was also found in the CRT group (8.0 [i.q.r. 4.0–12.0] versus 12.0 [i.q.r. 8.0–17.0], P = 0.020). More LNs were retrieved in patients younger than 60 years in the TNT group (12.0 [i.q.r. 7.0–17.0] versus 10.0 [i.q.r. 7.0–14.0], P = 0.042). Although this trend was not observed in the CRT group, fewer LNs were retrieved in patients who underwent TME and achieved R0 resection (11.0 [i.q.r. 7.0–17.0] versus 16.5 [i.q.r. 9.8–22.0], P = 0.036).\n\nIdentification of the cut-off value for LN yield in the TNT group\n\nThe RCS functions reflecting the number of LNs retrieved showed that prognostic factors presented a linear relationship (non-linearity P = 0.718; Fig. 4 ). This result suggested that the number of LNs retrieved could be modelled as a continuous linear variable. A cut-off value ( n = 11) was used for affecting clinical outcomes for which the HR was = 1.00. Patients were thus divided into two subgroups: the extended lymphadenectomy subgroup (with ≥11 LNs retrieved) and the limited lymphadenectomy subgroup (with <11 LNs retrieved).\n\nAmong the 227 patients, 104 patients (45.8%) were in the limited subgroup, whereas 123 patients (54.2%) were in the extended subgroup. The survival curve showed that patients who underwent limited LN retrieval had worse OS than those who underwent extended LN retrieval (HR 2.95 (95% c.i. 1.47 to 5.92), P = 0.001; Fig. 5 ). After adjustment for clinical confounders (sex, age, ECOG score, distance to anal verge, MRF status, EMVI status, clinical stage, severe AEs, extent of resection, ypT stage and ACT), limited LN retrieval was associated with worse OS (HR 3.01 (95% c.i. 1.43 to 6.34), P < 0.001; Supplementary Materials , Table S1 ). However, a significant difference in DFS between the two groups of patients was not documented (HR 1.33 (95% c.i. 0.84 to 2.13), P = 0.224; Supplementary Materials , Fig. S3 ). Furthermore, OS survival analyses were performed for the ypN0 and ypN1 subgroups. As expected, limited LN retrieval led to poorer OS in both subgroups ( Fig. 5 ). However, there was no significant difference between the ypN0-limited subgroup and the ypN1-adequate subgroup (HR 0.38 (95% c.i. 0.11 to 1.30), P = 0.109; Fig. 5d ). Despite adjustment for clinical confounders, patients in the ypN0-limited subgroup still had a similar prognosis as patients in the ypN1-adequate subgroup (HR 0.32 (95% c.i. 0.08 to 1.26), P = 0.102; Supplementary Materials , Table S2 ).\n\nAdjuvant chemotherapy for limited LN retrieval in the TNT group\n\nIn the TNT group, 176 of the 227 patients (77.5%) received ACT, whereas 51 (22.5%) did not. Figure 6 shows that ACT was associated with better OS than no ACT (HR 0.30 (95% c.i. 0.15 to 0.59), P < 0.001). After adjustment for clinical confounders, ACT was still associated with improved OS (HR 0.37 (95% c.i. 0.18 to 0.75), P < 0.001; Supplementary Materials , Table S3 ). Among the patients who underwent limited LN retrieval, ACT also resulted in a better prognosis (HR 0.25 (95% c.i. 0.11 to 0.57), P < 0.001; Fig. 6 ). Remarkably, there was no significant difference between the ACT and no ACT subgroups when an extended number of LNs was retrieved (HR 0.90 (95% c.i. 0.20 to 4.10), P = 0.887; Fig. 6 ). The same results were documented in the DFS survival analyses ( Fig. 6 ). ACT was associated with better DFS than no ACT (HR 0.37 (95% c.i. 0.23 to 0.61), P < 0.001). After adjustment for clinical confounders, ACT was still associated with improved DFS (HR 0.42 (95% c.i. 0.26 to 0.70), P < 0.001; Supplementary Materials , Table S4 ). It was also found that ACT showed better DFS outcomes in patients who underwent limited LN retrieval (HR 0.28 (95% c.i. 0.14 to 0.54), P < 0.001; Fig. 6 ) but not in those who underwent an extended lymphadenectomy (HR 0.60 (95% c.i. 0.27 to 1.31), P = 0.192; Fig. 6 ).\n\nDiscussion\n\nThis research, based on the STELLAR trial, investigated the number of LNs in patients with LARC after short-term radiotherapy plus neoadjuvant chemotherapy (TNT). The results documented that postoperative ACT significantly improved OS and DFS in patients with limited lymphadenectomy. Nevertheless, patients in whom an adequate number of LNs was retrieved did not show improvement in OS or DFS with ACT. Based on these findings, at least 11 LNs should be retrieved in these patients to achieve optimal prognostic benefits, accurate N staging and better decision-making regarding ACT.\n\nAdditionally, one of the main findings of the present study was superior T downstaging in the TNT group compared with the CRT group, which could be attributed to the fact that TNT has a superior pCR rate compared with CRT 7 , 8 ; other reasons could include the higher single radiation dose in short-term radiotherapy and the effects of the four cycles of neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Moreover, NAT can also lead to an improvement in N staging 9 . N downstaging was nearly 70% of patients in both groups, which was greater than the extent of T downstaging. These findings indicate that NAT plays a crucial role in treating regional LNM.\n\nAlthough NAT can affect the number of harvested LNs 10 , 11 , few previous studies have reported the optimal number of LNs to retrieve in CRC patients after NAT. The latest clinical guidelines suggest that at least 12 LNs should be retrieved in CRC patients to accurately define the LNM status and that re-examination should be performed if fewer than 12 LNs are retrieved 3 . With continuing improvements in pathological examinations and advancements in surgical techniques, the number of retrieved LNs has significantly increased; for example, others suggested that the minimum number of LNs retrieved should be 16 for node-negative CRC patients based on real-world data 12 , whereas other Italian groups have proposed that the number of LNs retrieved has no prognostic impact in node-negative rectal cancer patients after NAT 13 . Moreover, although a worse OS was documented in the limited LN retrieval subgroup than the extended LN retrieval subgroup, no difference was observed in DFS between the two groups. This suggests that the number of lymph nodes retrieved may not significantly impact the local recurrence of LARC. However, as patients require further treatment to control the disease upon recurrence, those who undergo adequate LN retrieval might benefit more from such treatment, potentially improving their OS. Considering that adequate LN retrieval is still a critical component of high-quality surgical standards in CRC patients 14 , this study suggests that the retrieval of ≥11 LNs may be considered sufficient for adequate LN retrieval in patients with LARC after TNT.\n\nIn addition to indicating differences in patient prognosis, adequate LN retrieval is essential for ensuring accurate N staging 12 , 15 . According to the AJCC nodal staging criteria, ypN0 patients are expected to have a better prognosis than ypN1 patients. However, a similar OS in ypN0-limited and ypN1-extended patients was reported here. This prognostic difference showed that ypN0 patients could be upstaged to ypN1 if adequate LN retrieval could not be achieved to determine their LN status, which is consistent with the findings of previous studies of non–neoadjuvant-treated CRC patients 16 , 17 .\n\nPrevious studies have demonstrated that postoperative ACT after long-term concurrent CRT cannot substantially improve OS because of poor patient tolerance and compliance 18–20 . However, in the present study, patients in the TNT group who underwent postoperative ACT exhibited more favourable prognostic outcomes, both OS and DFS, than those who did not. After adjusting for confounders, it was found that patients with LARC could benefit from postoperative ACT after short-term radiotherapy plus neoadjuvant chemotherapy in patients with <11 LNs retrieved. On the other hand, we found that patients who underwent extended LN retrieval did not have the same benefit from ACT. Taken together, these findings suggest that postoperative ACT should be considered for patients with LARC who have undergone limited LN retrieval after TNT (short-term radiotherapy plus neoadjuvant chemotherapy).\n\nA strength of this study is that it was based on a multicentre, open-label, randomized phase III trial. Patients were enrolled from 16 hospitals in 11 provinces of China, effectively representing the characteristics of the Chinese population.\n\nStill, there are several limitations. First, the number of LNs examined can be affected by various factors, such as the extent of surgical resection, the thoroughness of the pathological examination, host immune status and the use of neoadjuvant treatment 21–23 . Differences in these factors could have led to heterogeneity in findings. Second, another limitation could be the relatively small sample size, even though this cohort was derived from a high-quality phase III trial.\n\nOverall, this research documented that retrieving 11 or more LNs could be sufficient for adequate LN retrieval and accurate N staging in patients with LARC after short-term radiotherapy plus neoadjuvant chemotherapy (TNT), suggesting that postoperative ACT should be considered for those patients who have undergone inadequate LN lymphadenectomy.\n\nAuthor contributions\n\nYueyang Zhang (Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Validation, Visualization, Writing—original draft, Writing—review & editing), Yuan Tang (Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Methodology, Supervision, Visualization, Writing—review & editing), Huiying Ma (Data curation, Formal analysis, Resources, Validation, Writing—original draft), Hao Su (Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Methodology, Visualization, Writing—original draft, Writing—review & editing), Zheng Xu (Conceptualization, Data curation, Writing—original draft), Changyuan Gao (Conceptualization, Data curation, Validation, Writing—original draft), Haitao Zhou (Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Resources, Validation, Visualization, Writing—review & editing), and Jing Jin (Conceptualization, Data curation, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Project administration, Supervision, Visualization, Writing—review & editing)",
