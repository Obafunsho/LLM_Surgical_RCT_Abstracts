  "title": "Technical Performance Score is Associated with Outcomes after the Norwood Procedure",
  "abstract": "Objectives: Technical Performance Score (TPS) has been reported in a single center study to predict outcomes after congenital cardiac surgery. We sought to determine the association of TPS with outcomes in patients undergoing Norwood procedure in the Single Ventricle Reconstruction Trial.\n\nMethods: We calculated TPS (Class 1-Optimal; Class 2-Adequate; Class 3-Inadequate) based on predischarge echocardiograms analyzed in a Core Laboratory and unplanned reinterventions that occurred prior to discharge from the Norwood hospitalization. Multivariable regression examined the association of TPS with time to first extubation, Norwood length of stay (LOS), death/transplantation, unplanned post-discharge reinterventions, and neurodevelopment at 14 months of age.\n\nResults: Among 549 patients undergoing a Norwood procedure, 356 (65%) had an echocardiogram adequate to assess atrial septal restriction/arch obstruction or an unplanned reintervention, enabling calculation of TPS. In multivariable regression adjusting for preoperative variables, a better TPS was an independent predictor of shorter time to first extubation (p=0.019), better transplant-free survival before Norwood discharge (p<0.001; odds ratio 9.1 for Inadequate vs. Optimal score), shorter hospital LOS (p<0.001), fewer unplanned reinterventions between Norwood discharge and Stage II (p=0.004), and higher Bayley II Psychomotor Development Index at 14 months (p=0.031). TPS was not associated with transplant-free survival after Norwood discharge, unplanned reinterventions after Stage II or Bayley II Mental Development Index at 14 months.\n\nConclusion: TPS is an independent predictor of important outcomes after Norwood and may serve as a tool for quality improvement.",
