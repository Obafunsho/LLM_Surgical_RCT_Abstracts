  "abstract": "Objective:: To evaluate the benefits of probe-based near infrared autofluorescence (NIRAF) parathyroid identification during parathyroidectomy.\n\nSummary Background Data:: Intraoperative parathyroid gland identification during parathyroidectomy can be challenging, while additionally requiring costly frozen sections. Earlier studies have established NIRAF detection as a reliable intraoperative adjunct for parathyroid identification.\n\nMethods:: Patients undergoing parathyroidectomy for primary hyperparathyroidism were prospectively enrolled by a senior surgeon (>20 years’ experience) and a junior surgeon (<5 years’ experience), while being randomly allocated to the probe-based NIRAF or control group. Data collected included procedure type, number of parathyroids identified with high confidence by the surgeon and the resident, number of frozen sections performed, parathyroidectomy duration, and number of patients with persistent disease at the first post-operative visit.\n\nResults:: One hundred and sixty patients were randomly enrolled under both surgeons to the probe group (n=80) vs. control (n=80). In the probe group, parathyroid identification rate of the senior surgeon improved significantly from 3.2 to 3.6 parathyroids per patient (p<0.001), while that of the junior surgeon also rose significantly from 2.2 to 2.5 parathyroids per patient (p=0.001). Parathyroid identification was even more prominent for residents increasing significantly from 0.9 to 2.9 parathyroids per patient (p<0.001). Furthermore, there was a significant reduction in frozen sections utilized in the probe group vs. control (17 vs 47, p=0.005).\n\nConclusions:: Probe-based NIRAF detection can be a valuable intraoperative adjunct and educational tool for improving confidence in parathyroid gland identification, while potentially reducing the number of frozen sections required.",
