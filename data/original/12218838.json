  "full_text": "Background\n\nIschemic heart disease (IHD), which manifests as myocardial hypoxia and impaired aerobic energy metabolism, is the major cardiovascular health concern and accounts for 49.2% of cardiovascular disease (CVD) deaths [ 1 ]. The risk factors for IHD are classified into three categories, including metabolic risks, behavioral risks, and environmental risks [ 1 , 2 ]. Admittedly, metabolism (e.g., high systolic blood pressure) and behavioral characteristics (e.g., dietary) are pivotal contributors to the development of IHD [ 3 ]. Nevertheless, recent research has begun to pay more attention to the nonnegligible contributions of environmental risks [ 4 , 5 ]. Air pollution, particularly ambient particulate matter (PM) pollution, to which the global population is widely exposed, ranks fourth among all IHD risk factors [ 2 ]. Hence, it is crucial to investigate the specific impacts of PM on IHD, identify effect biomarkers and elucidate potential mechanisms, to aid in recognizing and intervening in cardiovascular damage caused by environmental particles.\n\nThe diverse sources of PM lead to significant variations in concentration and physicochemical properties across regions, weakening the conclusions on the effect biomarkers and mechanisms of PM [ 6 , 7 ]. Among diverse sources, PM from anthropogenic sources, mainly fossil fuel combustion from the diesel engines [ 8 ], is primary correlated with the mortality risks of CVD [ 9 , 10 ]. The PM generated by diesel engines, named as diesel particulate matter (DPM), is a relatively stable constituent [ 11 ]. Due to the widespread application of diesel engines, DPM results in a widespread exposure for occupational workers (1.6–26.9%) and a large segment of the general population [ 12 , 13 ]. Therefore, DPM, which has stable constituents and a broad exposure population, can be selected as a typical external environmental risk factor to study the effect biomarkers and underlying mechanisms of PM-caused IHD, so as to eliminate differences caused by the complexity of PM.\n\nAvailable data on biomarkers related to DPM exposure mainly focus on the exposure biomarkers [ 14 , 15 ], or the effect biomarkers of lung injury and inflammation [ 15 – 18 ]. However, the effect biomarkers of DPM-induced IHD pathogenesis remain poorly understood. Attenuated mitochondrial aerobic metabolism is an important feature of IHD pathogenesis and progression [ 19 ]. To adapt to oxygen deficiency, cardiac energy metabolism shifts to anaerobic glycolysis, and mitochondrial aerobic metabolism decreases [ 19 , 20 ]. Our previous study has demonstrated that PM exposure inhibited mitochondrial aerobic metabolism [ 21 ], suggesting that alterations in mitochondrial aerobic metabolism may serve as a potential biomarker for environmental particle-caused IHD. However, research into the effects of DPM on mitochondrial aerobic metabolism in IHD, particularly as the effect biomarkers, is still in their initial stages and warrants further research.\n\nGeneral studies on the regulation of mitochondrial aerobic energy metabolism have focused mainly on the hormones (e.g., thyroid hormone) and signaling molecules (e.g., mammalian target of rapamycin) [ 22 – 27 ]. However, the above mediators do not directly participate in the aerobic energy metabolism process but rather indirectly regulate some links in the process. The mitochondrial ions magnesium (Mg 2 ⁺) and calcium (Ca 2 ⁺), which directly participate in regulating mitochondrial aerobic metabolism and cardiac function, are gaining increased attention [ 28 ]. Both mitochondrial Mg 2+ and Ca 2+ catalyze and activate the activity of critical enzymes in mitochondrial aerobic metabolism (e.g., isocitrate dehydrogenase (ICDH)) [ 29 , 30 ]. These enzymes also regulate the dephosphorylation of pyruvate dehydrogenase phosphatase, thus activating pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) and the subsequent aerobic energy metabolism process. In view of the direct role of Mg 2+ and Ca 2+ in regulating mitochondrial aerobic metabolism, investigating the disruptions in their balance can provide critical insights into the mechanisms underlying the impact of DPM.\n\nIn this study, we investigated the biomarkers and underlying mechanisms of DPM in relation to myocardial hypoxia injury. We analyzed a well-characterized population cohort exposed to DPM and observed detrimental effects on pulse oxygen saturation and blood perfusion during stress, concomitant with an elevated risk of myocardial hypertrophy and ischemia-hypoxia. Utilizing a mouse model exposed to occupational environmentally relevant doses of DPM and a cellular model that replicates myocardial hypoxia injury, we identified suppressed cardiac mitochondrial aerobic metabolism as an early effect biomarker for myocardial hypoxia injury. Furthermore, we revealed that DPM induced a reduction in mitochondrial Mg 2+ and Ca 2+ , and uncovered that only Mg 2+ supplementation mostly alleviated DPM-mediated disruption of mitochondrial aerobic metabolism, suggesting that mitochondrial Mg 2+ deficiency is a direct mechanism involved. Mg 2+ deficiency was associated with disrupted Mg 2+ transport proteins, such as DPM-enhanced the hyperubiquitination and degradation of Mrs2, limiting mitochondrial Mg 2+ uptake. Together, our findings highlight the compromised mitochondrial aerobic metabolism as a critical biomarker for IHD caused by DPM and provide mitochondrial Mg 2+ deficiency as a potential investigative avenue for mitigating DPM-induced cardiovascular risks.\n\nMethods\n\nStudy population\n\nThe cohort of diesel engine testers (DET) was established in 2012, and a detailed description of the DET cohort, including the working environment, environmental exposure monitoring, and inclusion and exclusion criteria, has been provided in our previous study [ 31 ]. For this study, we recruited 31 male DETs from the DET cohort with at least 6 months of heavy-duty diesel engine testing history as the DPM exposure group. The non-DET group consisted of 34 male workers without DPM exposure from Luoyang Dongfang People’s Hospital and Luoyang Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Individuals with conditions such as inflammation, diabetes, tumors, or CVD were excluded. The demographic characteristics (age, body mass index (BMI), sex, clinical history, smoking history, and alcohol use) of the participants were collected using a standard questionnaire.\n\nAssessment of cardiac function and injury\n\nAll participants underwent electrocardiogram examination, echocardiogram examination, and measurements of serum myoglobin (MYO), troponin I (TnI), creatine kinase (CK), and creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB) levels. The serum levels of MYO, TnI, CK, and CK-MB were used in the diagnosis of myocardial injury according to previous studies [ 32 – 35 ]. For the measurement of the serum MYO, TnI, CK, and CK-MB levels, approximately 5 mL of the whole blood was collected from each participant into sterile vacutainer tubes. Following centrifugation to separate the serum, the levels of MYO, TnI, CK, and CK-MB were then quantified using an automated biochemistry analyzer equipped with corresponding clinical diagnostic test kits at Luoyang Dongfang People’s Hospital. The established reference ranges for normal serum levels of MYO, TnI, CK, and CK-MB are 0–110, 0–0.06, 25–190, and 0–24, respectively. Myocardial injury was diagnosed when the serum levels of one or more of these biomarkers exceeded the respective 99th percentile upper limit of the normal reference range [ 32 , 36 – 38 ]. Individuals with one or more of the following electrocardiogram (ECG) characteristics were considered to be at risk of myocardial hypertrophy: left axis deviation, right axis deviation, deep S wave in V1, high R wave in V5, R/S ≥ 1 in V1, increase in QRS duration, according to previous studies [ 39 – 42 ]. Individuals with one or more of the following ECG characteristics are considered to be at risk of myocardial ischemia: ST-elevation, ST-depression, T-wave inversion, and T-wave turning shallow, flat or upright, according to previous studies [ 43 , 44 ]. The 6-min walking test (6MWT) was performed according to American Thoracic Society standards in an open outdoor area measuring 30 m. Heart rate (HR), pulse oxygen saturation (SpO2), and perfusion index (PI) were recorded using the pulse oximeter (100H, Heal Force Bio-meditech Holdings Limited, China). The total walking distance of each participant was calculated based on the number of laps walked and the distance covered in the last incomplete lap. The Borg Dyspnea Index score, which assesses difficulty breathing and fatigue, was evaluated using the Borg scale. This study obtained approval from the Research Ethics Committee of the National Institute for Occupational Health and Poison Control, Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (protocol number: NIOHP201604), in accordance with local regulations.\n\nStatistical analysis of population data\n\nTo assess the variance between the DET and non-DET groups, an independent samples t -test or a rank sum test was employed. Qualitative analysis of the odds ratio (OR) was performed using the chi-square test or Fisher exact test. Logistic regression adjusted for covariates was used to investigate the correlation between physical signs and the presence of myocardial hypertrophy and ischemia. Weighted quantile sum (WQS) regression was utilized to calculate the weight between physical signs and myocardial hypertrophy and ischemia. R software (version 4.1.2, USA) was used for the statistical analyses. A P -value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.\n\nDPM preparation and characterization\n\nDetails of DPM collection and extraction were described in our previous study [ 45 ]. Briefly, the DPM was collected on a polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) filter using an air sampler (KB-120F, Genstar Electonic Technology Co., China), located in a diesel engine testing workshop of YTO Group Corporation, Henan province, China. DPM samples were extracted by the sequential sonication, oscillation, and vacuum-freeze drying. Based on the physicochemical properties of DPM described in our previous study [ 46 ], the DPM used in our study has a stable composition and properties and represents the particles derived from the diesel engine. Prior to use, a 1 mg mL −1 DPM stock solution in Milli-Q water was prepared. Following UV-irradiation for 30 min and sonication for 15 min, the working solution was freshly prepared by diluting the stock solution with the corresponding culture medium.\n\nAnimal experiments\n\nThe animal experiments followed ARRIVE guidelines (Additional file 1 ). Both male and female C57BL/6 J mice (6 weeks old) with a body weight (b.w.) of 18 g ± 2 g were purchased from the Vital River Laboratory (Beijing Vital River Laboratory Animal Technology Co., Ltd, China). After acclimatization for 1 week in a standard environment (free access to food and water, 12-h light/12-h dark cycle, 24℃ ± 2℃), all mice were randomly divided into four groups using a random number table, including control group (normal saline), 0.30 mg kg −1 b.w. DPM group (low-dose DPM), 1.40 mg kg −1 b.w. DPM group (medium-dose DPM), and 2.75 mg kg −1 b.w. DPM group (high-dose DPM). Each group comprised 6 male and 6 female mice, with careful consideration of both statistical validity and laboratory animal ethics. Mice in each group were intratracheally instilled with 50 μL saline or corresponding suspension of DPM in saline after anesthesia with sodium pentobarbital (8 mg kg −1 b.w., Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA), every 3 days, and continued for 12 days. The corresponding author remained aware of the group allocations at all stages of the experiment and there were no exclusions of mice in experiments.\n\nWe designed the exposure doses of DPM according to DPM concentrations in three different occupational environments, that is, (1) diesel engine assembly (15.47 μg m −3 ), (2) adjustment (71.75 μg m −3 ), and (3) inspection (140.50 μg m −3 ). The doses of 0.30, 1.40, and 2.75 mg kg −1 b.w. adopted in this study were approximately equal to the occupational inhalation exposure of 15.47, 71.75, and 140.50 μg m −3 DPM, respectively. The dosage of DPM (mg kg −1 b.w.) administered to mice was determined by converting the occupationally relevant dose of DPM (μg m −3 ) to the murine exposure dose. This conversion was achieved by multiplying the environmental concentration (μg m −3 ) by the daily respiratory volume of mice (0.129 m 3 ), the duration of exposure (3 days), and then dividing by the average body weight of the mice (approximately 20 g). The study was approved by the Ethics Committee Medical College of Qingdao University (QDU-AEC-2024543) and was conducted in accordance with the institutional guidelines.\n\nElectrocardiogram assessment\n\nAfter the termination of the exposure procedure, the ECG of mice was monitored using a BL-420E + biological function experimental system (Tameng, China) after anesthesia with sodium pentobarbital (8 mg kg −1 b.w., Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA). Two electrodes were embedded into the skin on both sides of the mice’s chest to ensure the heart was located between the two electrodes. Then, the ECG waveform was recorded every minute in a digital format and used for quantification analysis. The following ECG indexes were calculated: (1) HR; (2) heart rate variability (HRV): root mean square of successive differences of R-R intervals (RMSSD), standard deviation of all five-minute NN intervals (SDANN), and triangular interpolation of RR intervals (TINN); and (3) changes in the electrocardiogram waveform: T-wave amplitude, P-wave amplitude, R-wave amplitude, QT-wave durations, QRS-wave durations, and PR-wave durations. After ECG assessment, the mice were euthanized and heart tissues were collected for the followed experiments.\n\nHematoxylin–eosin (H&E) assay\n\nHeart tissue samples from control and DPM-exposed mice were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and dehydrated in gradient ethanol. After being embedded in paraffin, the heart tissues were sectioned into 4-μm slices at the middle cross-sectional. After staining with hematoxylin–eosin dye, the sections were scanned by a Nikon Eclipse E100 microscope with a Nikon DS-U3 imaging system (Nikon, Japan). The right ventricular wall thickness of the mouse heart was measured as described in the previous study and was normalized by dividing the weight of the mouse heart [ 47 ].\n\nWheat-germ agglutinin (WGA) staining of the myocardial cell membrane\n\nThe obtained slices of heart tissue as described above were submitted to WGA staining. After immersion in ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid antigen retrieval solution (Servicebio, G1206, China) to retrieve antigen, the slices were stained with WGA (1:500, Sigma, L4895, St. Louis, MO, USA) and 4'−6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI, Servicebio, G1012, China). The stained sections were then observed and photographed under an Ortho-Fluorescent Microscopy (Nikon Eclipse C1, Japan). Fluorescence images were collected by an imaging system (Nikon DS-U3, Japan) at corresponding wavelengths (WGA: 495 nm/515 nm (λex/λem); DAPI: 340 nm/488 nm (λex/λem)). The cross-sectional area was evaluated by the average outlines of the randomly selected myocardial cells and quantified by ImageJ software (version 1.8.0).\n\nImmunohistochemical analysis of HIF-1α\n\nImmunohistochemical analysis was carried out according to the previous study [ 21 ]. Briefly, the slices of mice heart tissues were sequentially incubated with the primary antibody HIF-1α (1:200, Bioss, bs-0737R, China) and the secondary antibody (HRP labeled). After incubation, the sections were stained with diaminobenzidine and hematoxylin stain solution. Finally, stained sections were observed using a Nikon E100 (Nikon, Japan) and images were captured with an imaging system (Nikon DS-U3, Japan). The images were evaluated according to the HIF-1α-positive cardiomyocyte nuclei percent in each section calculated by ImageJ software (version 1.8.0).\n\nCell culture\n\nAC16 cell line, a type of human cardiomyocyte, was obtained from the Jennio Biotechnology Co. LTD (Jennio Biotech, China). The cells were cultured in high-glucose DMEM medium (basalMedia, China) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Saihongrui Biotechnology Co., Ltd., China) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Solarbio, China) in an incubator with 5% CO 2 , 95% humidified atmosphere air, and 37℃.\n\nHypoxia and HIF-1α signaling mimic cellular model construction\n\nTo establish the cellular models of ischemia and hypoxia, three kinds of cell culture media were selected to simulate different ischemic states according to previous studies [ 21 ]. Briefly, high-glucose DMEM medium with regular FBS (10%) (HGM-10% FBS), high-glucose DMEM medium with low FBS (0.5%) (HGM-0.5% FBS), and no glucose DMEM medium with no FBS (NGM-0% FBS) were used to simulate the nutritional conditions in minor, partial, and full ischemia, respectively [ 21 ]. Then, the condition of 2% O 2 , 5% CO 2 , and 93% N 2 or treatment with the common HIF-1α signaling mimic-CoCl 2 (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) was used to simulate the hypoxia conditions.\n\nTo evaluate the cytotoxicity of DPM on AC16 cells and screen the cytotoxic concentration at 2% O 2 (hypoxia), cells were seeded in 96-well plates at the density of 1.0 × 10 4 cells well −1 . After culturing for 12 h, the cells were stimulated with DPM suspensions at different concentration (0, 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 100, and 200 μg mL −1 ) in HGM-10% FBS under normal condition or in HGM-10% FBS, HGM-0.5% FBS, and NGM-0% FBS under hypoxic condition for 12 h. Finally, the cells were used for cell viability assessment. The cytotoxic concentrations (1, 5, and 10 μg mL −1 ) at hypoxia were selected to further screen the medium for hypoxia cellular model. After AC16 cells were seeded in 6 well cell culture plates at the density of 3.5 × 10 5 cells well −1 and cultured for 12 h, the cells were exposed to DPM (0, 1, 5, 10 μg mL −1 ) in HGM-10% FBS or HGM-0.5% FBS under hypoxia for 12 h and then harvested for western blotting.\n\nIn order to select suitable CoCl 2 concentration for HIF-1α signaling mimic, AC16 cells were seeded in 6-well cell culture plates at the density of 3.5 × 10 5 cells well −1 . After culturing for 12 h, the cells were stimulated with CoCl 2 (0, 50, 100, 200, 400, 600, 800 μmol L −1 ) for 12 h in HGM-10% FBS, HGM-0.5% FBS, and NGM-0% FBS, respectively. Finally, the cells were harvested for the western blotting to evaluate the HIF-1α expression. Based on the screened CoCl 2 dose (200 μM) for HIF-1α signaling mimic, to further screen the medium for HIF-1α signaling mimic, the cells were exposed with DPM (0, 1, 5, 10 μg mL −1 ) in HGM-0.5% FBS or NGM-0% FBS with 200 μM CoCl 2 for 12 h and then harvested for western blot analysis.\n\nWestern blot\n\nAfter stimulation, the cardiac tissues or AC16 cells were lysed in radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) buffer (Meilunbio, China) using ultrasonic disruption. Following centrifugation of the cell lysate at 13,000 g for 20 min, the supernatants were collected for quantification of the protein concentration and subsequent western blot analysis, as previously described [ 48 ]. After antibody incubation, the protein bands were washed in TBST three times, incubated with enhanced chemiluminescence reagent (Sparkjade, ED0015-B, China) and scanned with a chemiluminescence imaging system (Tanon, China). The expression of protein was quantified by ImageJ software (version 1.8.0) and normalized to the corresponding pixel densities of β-actin, β-tubulin or GAPDH.\n\nDetermination of ATP content\n\nAfter stimulation with 0, 1, 5, and 10 μg mL −1 DPM for 12 h under hypoxia or hypoxia mimic cellular model, the ATP content was quantified using an ATP assay kit (Beyotime, China), based on the fluorescence intensity of ATP catalyzed firefly luciferase, as described in a previous study [ 21 ]. Luminescence was measured by a Varioskan multifunction microplate reader (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA) and the absolute content of ATP in each group was calculated according to the standard curve. Followed by the measurement of the protein concentration by a BCA assay kit (Meilunbio, China), the ATP concentration was normalized to the protein concentration and expressed as nmol mg −1 protein.\n\nMitochondrial aerobic metabolism assay\n\nAfter stimulation with 0 and 10 μg mL −1 DPM for 12 h under hypoxia cellular model, the mitochondrial respiratory assessment was applied using the Oxygraph-2 k system (O2k, Oroboros, Innsbruck, Austria). After stimulation as described above, the cells were harvested, washed with PBS twice and centrifuged at 600 g for 5 min. Followed by suspension in MIR05 buffer, the cell number were counted using a C100-SE Automated Cell Counter (RWD, China), and 2 × 10 6 cells were added to the 2-mL chamber of the O2k. To assess mitochondrial respiratory function, we utilized the following substrates and inhibitors and measured oxygen consumption rates (OCR): 10 mM pyruvate and 2 mM malate to measure proton leakage associated with mitochondrial respiratory chain complex I (CI), 2.5 mM adenosine diphosphate (ADP) to determine CI-related ATP production capacity, 10 mM succinate to assess the overall OXPHOS capacity, 5 nM oligomycin to quantify ATP synthesis capacity, 0.5 μM carbonyl cyanide-4-(trifluoromethoxy)phenylhydrazone (FCCP) to measure maximum respiration capacity, 0.5 μM rotenone to evaluate mitochondrial respiratory chain complex II (CII) activity, and 2.5 μM antimycin to assess residual oxygen consumption (ROX). The following indicators of mitochondrial respiratory function were quantified by OCR values of 10 6 cells per second from stabilized oxygen consumption curve after adding the corresponding substrates and inhibitors according to the instruction of manufacturer: (1) minimum respiration was detected after mitochondrial preparation, (2) maximum respiration, (3) ATP capacity, (4) OXPHOS capacity, (5) leak respiration, (6) CI capacity, (7) CII capacity, and (8) ROX. Final results were normalized to the cell number: OCR (pmol s −1 10 −6 cells).\n\nInvestigation of the role of mitochondrial aerobic metabolism\n\nTo investigate the role of mitochondrial aerobic metabolism in DPM-induced myocardial hypoxia injury, the mitochondrial aerobic metabolism agonist, 10 μM epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG, T2988, TargetMol, China), an agonist of OXPHOS, was used for the 12 h of cotreatment with 10 μg mL −1 DPM in AC16 cells. After stimulation, the cells were submitted to the western blotting, determination of ATP content, and flow cytometry assay.\n\nFlow cytometry assay\n\nAfter stimulation with 10 μg mL −1 DPM and 10 μM EGCG for 12 h under hypoxia cellular model, the apoptosis of AC16 cells was determined using Annexin-V-FITC/PI kit (Meilunbio, China) via flow cytometry. Briefly, cells were harvested and centrifuged at 600 g for 5 min. After washing with PBS for twice, the cells were resuspended with CSB (PBS containing 1% FBS). Followed by incubation with AnnexinV-FITC and propidium iodide (PI) at 4 °C for 30 min, the stained cells were analyzed on a CytoFLEX flow cytometer (USA). The fluorescence intensities at corresponding wavelengths of FITC (490 nm/525 (λex/λem)) and PI (535 nm/615 nm (λex/λem)) were recorded in the FITC or PI channels, respectively. The mean fluorescence intensities from these channels were utilized for the quantitative analysis.\n\nMg 2 + and Ca 2 + level analysis\n\nTo assess the Mg 2+ and Ca 2+ level at the endpoints of DPM exposure, the Mag520-AM (MX4545, Shanghai Maokang Biotechnology Co., Ltd., China) (a Mg 2+ specific fluorescent probe) and Rhod-2 (HY-D0989, MedChemExpress, China) (a mitochondrial Ca 2+ specific fluorescent probe) were used [ 49 ]. After stimulation with 0 and 10 μg mL −1 DPM for 12 h under hypoxia or hypoxic mimic cellular model, the AC16 cells were washed with PBS twice and stained with 2 μM of Mag520-AM or 10 μM of Rhod-2 for 30 min. For Mag520-AM, followed by the wash with PBS for twice, the cells were then stained with 500 nM of MitoTracker Red CMXRos (MB6046, Meilunbio, China) for 30 min. After washing with PBS, the cells were counterstained with 10 μg mL −1 DAPI (MA0128, Meilunbio, China) for 5 min. The dyes were removed with PBS, and the cells were then observed and photographed using a STELLARIS 5 confocal microscopy (Leica, Germany) at corresponding wavelengths of Mag520-AM (490 nm/525 nm (λex/λem)), Rhod-2 (549 nm/578 nm (λex/λem)), MitoTracker Red CMXRos (579 nm/599 nm (λex/λem)), and DAPI (340 nm/488 nm (λex/λem)). The levels of mitochondrial Ca 2+ in per unit area of mitochondria were quantified by the fluorescence intensity of Rhod-2 using ImageJ software (version 1.8.0). To determine the levels of Mg 2+ , the fluorescence intensity of Mag-520 AM in per unit area of mitochondria or cytoplasm were quantified using the Image Calculator function in ImageJ software (version 1.8.0) according to https://imagej.net/imaging/colocalization-analysis#object-based-colocalization . Briefly, the merged images were split into three channels (red, green, and blue). The area where MitoTracker Red CMXRos was colocalized with Mag-520 AM was selected using the “And” option in Image Calculator and used for calculation of the mitochondrial Mg 2+ fluorescence intensity. Conversely, the cytoplasmic area of Mag-520 AM was selected using the “Subtract” option in Image Calculator and used for the calculation of cytoplasmic Mg 2+ fluorescence intensity. Additionally, the colocalization of MitoTracker Red CMXRos with Mag-520 AM was also quantified using “Colocalization Finder” plugin of ImageJ software according to http://questpharma.u-strasbg.fr/html/colocalization-finder.html . After the merged images were split, the colocalization area of MitoTracker Red CMXRos with Mag-520 AM was chosen using “Colocalization Finder” plugin according to the corresponding intensity ranges (MitoTracker Red CMXRos: 50–255 and Mag-520 AM: 50–255). “M1” value of the colocalization area, which represents the contribution of Mag-520 AM to the colocalization area, was quantified by “Colocalization Finder” plugin [ 50 ].\n\nDetermination of ICDH enzyme activity\n\nThe ICDH activity of cardiac tissues and AC16 cells was measured using a commercial kit (Solarbio, China) that detects the conversion of NADP + to NADPH by ICDH, which is indicative of enzymatic activity. The assay involved monitoring the change in optical density at 340 nm using a Varioskan multifunction microplate reader (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA). The ICDH activity was calculated based on the increase in NADPH optical density at 340 nm (ΔA) over a 2 min and was normalized to the protein concentration of sample (C sample ). The activity expressed as U mg −1 prot using the following equation: ICDH (U mg −1 prot) = 1608 × ΔA/C sample .\n\nInvestigation of the role of Mg 2 + and Ca 2 +\n\nTo investigate the role of Mg 2+ and Ca 2+ in DPM-induced mitochondrial aerobic metabolism attenuation, 1.2 and 1.6 times basal values of Mg 2+ or Ca 2+ were used for the 12 h cotreatment with DPM of the AC16 cells. After the stimulation, cells were harvested for the western blotting, determination of ATP content, and flow cytometry assays.\n\nCell transfection\n\nTo investigate the role of DPM-induced decrease in Mrs2 expression in the mitochondrial aerobic metabolism and hypoxia injury, we overexpressed Mrs2 in AC16 cells using the overexpression transfection plasmid of Mrs2 from Shanghai GenePharma Co., Ltd (GenePharma, China) and RFect Plasmid DNA Transfection Reagent (BAIDAI, China) according to the instructions. Briefly, the AC16 cells in 6- or 12-well cell culture plates were stimulated with HGM-10% FBS containing 3.2 μg plasmid, 10 μL RFect and 400 μL transfer buffer, or 1.6 μg plasmid, 5 μL RFect, and 200 μL transfer buffer, respectively. After transfection for 48 h, the AC16 cells were exposed to 10 μg mL −1 DPM under hypoxia cellular model and then harvested for the western blot, determination of ATP content, and Mg 2+ level analysis.\n\nCo-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP)\n\nAfter stimulation with 10 μg mL −1 DPM for 12 h under hypoxia cellular model, the AC16 cells were washed with PBS twice and lysed using ultrasonic disruption in NP-40 buffer (MA0156, Meilunbio, China). The lysates were centrifuged at 13,000 g for 20 min to obtain the supernatant, which was used for quantification of the protein concentration. Then, 500 μg of protein was diluted to 1 μg μL −1 for the Co-IP, with the remaining protein serving as an input control. The protein sample was incubated with either control mouse IgG or ubiquitin antibody at 4 °C overnight. After this, 40 μL Protein A + G Agarose (P2055, Beyotime Biotechnology, China) was added and the mixture was further incubated at 4 °C for 12 h. Following centrifugation at 8000 g , 4 °C for 1 min and wash with PBS three times, the protein A + G Agarose combined protein was collected, added 40 μL of 1 × loading buffer, and subjected to heat treatment in a metal bath at 99 °C for western blot assay.\n\nStatistical analysis of experimental data\n\nAnalysis of experimental data was conducted using GraphPad Prism (version 9.0, USA), or R software (version 4.1.2, USA) and all results are expressed as mean ± standard deviation (SD). All experiments were conducted for at least 3 technical replicates or independent experimental replicates and details were listed in figure legends. To assess the variance between two distinct groups, an independent samples t -test was employed. For comparisons involving more than two groups with one influence factor, one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Bonferroni t -test or Tukey’s test was applied. For comparisons involving more than two groups with two influence factors, two-way analysis of variance (two-way ANOVA) followed by Bonferroni post hoc analysis was applied. A P -value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.\n\nResults\n\nDPM increases myocardial hypertrophy risk and impairs the oxygen utilization ability of occupational workers\n\nTo assess the potential cardiac risks of DPM exposure, we applied a unique population of diesel engine testers (DET) with stable DPM exposure and a general population without DPM exposure (non-DET) (Fig. 1 ). Both DET and non-DET have similar demographics and characteristics, including age, body mass index (BMI), smoking, and alcohol use (Table 1 ). Despite an increased trend observed in the DET group, the levels of serum myocardial injury biomarkers, such as myoglobin (MYO), creatine kinase (CK), and creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB), did not significantly differ between the DET group and non-DET group (Additional file 2 : Table S1). Meanwhile, the individuals with abnormally high myocardial injury biomarker levels than the 99th percentile upper reference limit were higher in DET (29.03%) than non-DET (17.65%) (Fig. 2 A). This finding suggested that DPM exposure might induce myocardial injury (OR = 1.91, 95% CI: 0.59–6.18) (Additional file 2 : Table S2). We further identified the potential adverse cardiac outcomes through electrocardiogram and echocardiogram. As illustrated in Fig. 2 B, DET have more abnormal electrocardiogram events related to myocardial hypertrophy (35.48%) or ischemia (22.58%). And DPM exposure significantly increased the risks of myocardial hypertrophy (OR = 5.68, 95% CI 1.41–22.93) (Additional file 2 : Table S3), and myocardial ischemia (OR = 9.68, 95% CI 1.11–83.48) in DET (Additional file 2 : Table S4). Consistently, the DET group exhibited a trend toward an increased incidence of echocardiographic abnormalities associated with myocardial hypertrophy, which included left atrial dilation and thickening of the basal segment of the interventricular septum (Fig. 2 C, Additional file 2 : Table S5). Taken together, these findings suggest that exposure to DPM in the DET group may elevate the risk of underlying cardiac pathologies, such as myocardial hypertrophy and ischemia, and cardiac injury.\n\nAn impaired cardiac oxygen utilization capacity are important features accompanied with myocardial hypertrophy and ischemia [ 51 ]. To investigate specific changes of cardiac oxygen utilization in DET under exercise pressure and representative characteristics of potential myocardial hypertrophy and ischemia, we performed the 6-min walking test (6MWT). The DET exhibited a higher Borg scale for dyspnea and fatigue (Fig. 2 D, Additional file 2 : Table S6), suggesting breathing difficulty and a reduced recovery capacity, indicative of compromised cardiac oxygen utilization. Furthermore, a rising trend in the perfusion index (PI) during the 6MWT signified that DPM exposure negatively impacted cardiac oxygen transport and utilization capacity, resulting in a significant decrease in pulse oxygen saturation (SpO 2 ) in the DET group post-6MWT (Fig. 2 E, Additional file 3 : Figure S1, and Additional file 2 : Table S7). We further investigated the representative 6MWT indicators related to potential myocardial hypertrophy and ischemia. Correlation analysis revealed that SpO 2 was significantly inversely associated with the potential risks of myocardial hypertrophy and ischemia among all participants, whether adjusting exposure (model I), or adjusting exposure, age, and BMI (model II) (Fig. 2 F, Tables S8 and S9, Supporting Information). SpO 2 also yielded the highest weighted quality score (WQS) index of potential myocardial hypertrophy and ischemia (Fig. 2 G), suggesting that the SpO 2 is a critical characteristic. Collectively, our data indicated an impaired cardiac oxygen utilization capacity in the elevated risk of potential cardiac hypertrophy and ischemia due to DPM exposure.\n\nDPM induces myocardial hypertrophy and hypoxic injury in mice heart\n\nTo more accurately delineate the characteristics associated with impaired cardiac oxygen utilization capacity in cardiac hypertrophy or ischemia risks resulting from exposure to DPM, we established a mouse model exposed to several occupational environmentally relevant doses of DPM (Additional file 3 : Figure S2A). Neither body weight, organ coefficient of heart, nor heart rate has significant alteration (Additional file 3 : Figure S2B-D). As illustrated in Fig. 3 A, the DPM-exposed mice exhibited abnormal electrocardiogram as manifested by occasional arrhythmia, when compared with control mice. The further quantitative analysis showed the statistical decrease of heart rate variability (HRV), such as root mean square of successive RR interval differences (RMSSD), standard deviation of the average NN intervals (SDANN), and triangular interpolation of NN interval (TINN) (Fig. 3 B), implying the potential disturbance of cardiac function in mice caused by DPM exposure. With respect to the alteration in cardiac structure, DPM-exposed mice displayed an increase in right ventricular free wall thickness (Fig. 3 C). Moreover, we found hypertrophy of cardiomyocytes in DPM-exposed mice (Fig. 3 D). Of note, the area of cardiomyocytes was increased ~ twofold induced by DPM under high dose (Fig. 3 E), indicating a cardiac hypertrophy risk similar to DET in DPM-exposed mice.\n\nThe hypertrophy of cardiomyocytes increases oxygen demand and leads to hypoxia [ 51 ], which is a major factor that causes cardiac injury [ 52 ]. We found that the percentage of hypoxia inducible factor-1 alpha (HIF-1α)-positive nuclei and the protein level, a representative marker for hypoxia (Fig. 3 F–H, Additional file 3 : Figure S2E,F), were promoted in DPM-exposed mice heart, indicating a potential hypoxic state in the myocardium. We further observed distinct pathological phenomena associated with myocardial injury in DPM-exposed mice, including evidence of myocardial fiber degeneration (indicated by the blue arrow) and structural disarray (illustrated in the blue box), which were particularly pronounced in the high-dose exposure group (Fig. 3 I). The elevated number of apoptotic cardiomyocytes validated the cardiomyocyte injury caused by DPM exposure (Fig. 3 J). Similarly, DPM-exposed mice showed the increased levels of proteins involved in the myocardial injury, such as cleaved-caspase3 and bax (Fig. 3 H). Collectively, our findings demonstrated that myocardial hypertrophy and hypoxic injury occur in the heart tissue of mice exposed to DPM, which could be used in further investigations of the characteristics of these diseases.\n\nImpairment of mitochondrial aerobic metabolism is a key precursor feature of DPM-induced myocardial hypoxic injury\n\nTo further investigate the effect biomarkers from the characteristics prior to DPM-induced cardiac hypoxia injury, we analyzed the crucial features involved in the hypoxia injury by retrieving data from databases on ischemic heart disease, which is characterized primarily by hypoxia injury. Notably, those terms predominantly associated with biological processes related to mitochondrial aerobic metabolism, including aerobic respiration and oxidative phosphorylation-related biological processes, emerged as significantly enriched among the top 15 pathways identified (Fig. 4 A). Generally, glycolysis is upregulated under anaerobic conditions and mitochondria contribute less to cellular energy production [ 19 , 20 ]. Although there is a metabolic shift toward glycolysis in hypoxia, aerobic respiratory capacity is not completely abolished [ 53 ], and OXPHOS remains a significant source of ATP production compared to glycolysis [ 54 , 55 ]. We thus postulate that disrupted mitochondrial aerobic metabolism is a predominant feature of myocardial hypoxic injury induced by DPM. A marked reduction in ATP content was recorded in hearts of mice treated with DPM, at both medium and high doses (Fig. 4 B), suggesting the occurrence of abnormal energy metabolism. Subsequent examination of oxidative phosphorylation complexes revealed that DPM-exposed mice exhibited the prominent downregulation of II-SDHB, III-UQCRC2, and V-ATP5A (Fig. 4 C, Additional file 3 : Figure S3), indicating the perturbation of mitochondrial aerobic metabolism in the hearts of mice exposed to DPM.\n\nTo clarify the role of the perturbation of mitochondrial aerobic metabolism in DPM-induced cardiac hypoxia injury, we established in vitro models of DPM-induced myocardial hypoxia injury using AC16 cells, a human cardiomyocyte cell line. These models were developed under two representative hypoxia conditions to simulate the hypoxia in the ischemic hearts of mice: 2% oxygen (O 2 ; hypoxia) and HIF-1α signaling mimic agent CoCl 2 . We screened for the most susceptible conditions to DPM-induced hypoxic injury via the above two models. DPM exposure at concentrations exceeding 20 μg mL −1 significantly reduces cardiomyocyte viability under normoxic conditions, suggesting that DPM has the potential to directly induce cardiotoxic effects. For the first hypoxia model (i.e., 2% O 2 ), DPM concentrations of 1, 5, and 10 μg mL −1 were chosen because of their more obvious effects on cell viability under 2% O 2 , which did not significantly impair cardiomyocyte viability under normal oxygen conditions (Additional file 3 : Figure S4A). These findings indicate that cardiomyocytes may be more vulnerable to DPM-induced cardiotoxicity under hypoxic condition. Furthermore, culture conditions with high glucose medium containing low FBS (0.5%) (HGM-0.5% FBS) were selected as an in vitro model for modeling the DPM-caused hypoxia injury in vivo, as evidenced by the significantly increased expression of HIF-1α, cleaved-caspase3, and bax (Additional file 3 : Figure S4B-D). For the second HIF-1α signaling mimic model (i.e., CoCl 2 ), we selected a concentration of 200 μM CoCl 2 , along with conditions of no glucose medium with no FBS (NGM-0% FBS), based on initial assessments of cell viability and DPM-induced obvious hypoxic injury (Additional file 3 : Figure S5A-F).\n\nSimilar decreased ATP in both 2% O 2 model and CoCl 2 model were observed in DPM-treated cardiomyocytes to it in the heart of DPM-exposed mice, when compared with the control group (Fig. 4 D, Additional file 3 : Figure S6A). Moreover, DPM-treated cardiomyocytes also showed the significant reduction in the expression of oxidative phosphorylation complexes, including I-NDUFB8, II-SDHB, IV-COXII, and V-ATP5A (Fig. 4 E, Additional file 3 : Figure S6B-D). Further comprehensive oxygraph-2 k system (O2k) analysis for mitochondrial aerobic energy metabolism demonstrated cardiomyocyte exhibited consistently decreased oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) capacity, particularly the complex I (CI) capacity, in response to DPM exposure (Fig. 4 F, Additional file 3 : Figure S6E,F). Together with the reduced expression of oxidative phosphorylation complexes, the cardiomyocytes exposed to 10 µg mL −1 DPM exposure showed restricted leak respiration and maximum respiration (Fig. 4 E,F). The attenuated OXPHOS capacity and mitochondrial aerobic metabolism in DPM-treated cardiomyocytes were ultimately reflected in less ATP capacity of mitochondrial aerobic energy metabolism (Fig. 4 G). These data indicated that impaired mitochondrial aerobic metabolism may be a key characteristic prior to myocardial hypoxic injury caused by DPM.\n\nTo determine whether impaired mitochondrial aerobic metabolism plays a pivotal role in the myocardial hypoxic injury caused by DPM, we used epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), an agonist of OXPHOS to promote ATP production, to rescue the impaired mitochondrial aerobic metabolism. EGCG supplementation effectively reversed the decrease in ATP content induced by DPM exposure to a normal level (Fig. 4 H). Furthermore, cardiomyocyte injury following 10 µg mL −1 DPM exposure, shown as increased expression of cleaved-caspase3 and bax protein, was mitigated by the co-treatment with EGCG (Fig. 4 H, Additional file 3 : Figure S7). The lower proportion of apoptotic cells in cardiomyocytes (Q2 and Q3) co-treated with DPM and EGCG served as additional evidence of the mitigation of injury, correlating with the restoration of mitochondrial aerobic metabolism (Fig. 4 I,J). Moreover, we further compared the roles of glysolysis and mitochondrial aerobic metabolism in DPM-induced hypoxia injury using 2-DG, an inhibitor of glysolysis (Additional file 3 : Figure S8). Compared to DPM-exposed group, DPM treatment in the presence of 2-DG induced higher proportion of apoptotic cells in cardiomyocytes (Q2 and Q3), indicating that mitochondrial aerobic metabolism might play a more important role. Overall, these results indicate that the impaired mitochondrial aerobic metabolism is a critical precursor feature in the onset of DPM-induced myocardial hypoxic injury (Fig. 4 K).\n\nDPM-caused mitochondrial Mg 2 + reduction leads to the abnormal mitochondrial aerobic metabolism\n\nThe status of mitochondrial aerobic metabolism is intimately linked with levels of mitochondrial Mg 2+ or Ca 2+ , which act as direct catalysts and activators for the key enzymes involved in this metabolic process [ 29 ]. Hence, we examined the alteration of mitochondrial Mg 2+ and Ca 2+ levels in cardiomyocytes following DPM exposure. Fluorescence intensities of both mitochondrial and cytoplasmic Mg 2+ and Ca 2+ were significantly attenuated in the groups treated with DPM under the 2% O 2 hypoxia model, as compared to the control group (Fig. 5 A,B, Additional file 3 : Figure S9A-C). Subsequently, we investigated the alteration of p-PDH dephosphorylation and ICDH activity, which are the crucial enzymes directly affected by Mg 2+ and Ca 2+ [ 29 , 30 ]. The dephosphorylation of p-PDH was inhibited in the DPM-exposed group under both 2% O 2 hypoxia model (Fig. 5 C,D) and CoCl 2 HIF-1α signaling mimic model (Additional file 3 : Figure S9D), as manifested by a reduction in PDH and an associated increase in p-PDH. A similar inhibition of ICDH enzyme activity was also detected (Fig. 5 E, Additional file 3 : Figure S9E). These findings were corroborated by similar inhibitory effects on both p-PDH dephosphorylation (Additional file 3 : Figure S9F) and ICDH activity (Additional file 3 : Figure S9G) in the in vivo model, revealing the potential role of mitochondrial Mg 2+ and Ca 2+ in the dysregulation of mitochondrial aerobic metabolism induced by DPM.\n\nTo further validate the regulatory role of mitochondrial Mg 2+ and Ca 2+ , we supplemented these ions to cardiomyocytes to rescue the mitochondrial Mg 2+ or Ca 2+ reduction caused by DPM exposure. As expected, the decreased mitochondrial Mg 2+ and Ca 2+ levels caused by DPM were reserved (Additional file 3 : Figure S10A-D). Surprisingly, despite the preserved mitochondrial Ca 2+ level, Ca 2+ supplementation failed to activate the dephosphorylation of p-PDH (Fig. 5 F,G) in DPM-treated cardiomyocytes. In contrast, restoring mitochondrial Mg 2+ significantly alleviated DPM-induced inhibition of dephosphorylation of p-PDH, especially 1.5-fold of increase of PDH and 33% decrease of p-PDH at a supplementation of 1.6 times Mg 2+ concentration, as compared to DPM exposed group (Fig. 5 F,G, Additional file 3 : Figure S10E,F). Similarly, cardiomyocytes exposed to DPM exhibited a consistent increase in ICDH activity to normal level in response to 1.6 times Mg 2+ supplementation while no such effect was observed with Ca 2+ supplementation (Fig. 5 H). Together, these results indicate a pivotal role for mitochondrial Mg 2+ in modulating the activity of the critical enzymes involved in the impaired cardiac mitochondrial aerobic metabolism due to DPM exposure.\n\nWe next investigated the impact of Mg 2+ supplementation on the impairment of mitochondrial aerobic metabolism induced by DPM. As illustrated in Fig. 5 I, Mg 2+ supplementation significantly mitigated the reduction in ATP content caused by DPM. Likewise, the decreases in the levels of oxidative phosphorylation complexes in cells treated with DPM alone were prevented by the addition of Mg 2+ (Fig. 5 J, Additional file 3 : Figure S10G), suggesting that the reduction in mitochondrial Mg 2+ was correlated with DPM-impaired mitochondrial aerobic metabolism. We next examined the myocardial hypoxic injury induced by DPM following Mg 2+ supplementation. Cardiomyocytes co-treated with DPM and Mg 2+ supplementation showed decreased expression of injury indicators, including bax and cleaved-caspase3 (Fig. 5 K, Additional file 3 : Figure S10H). Similarly, the percentage of injured cardiomyocytes (Q2 and Q3) due to DPM exposure was consistently decreased by co-treatment with Mg 2+ supplementation (Fig. 5 L,M). Together, these findings suggest that DPM-induced impairment of mitochondrial aerobic metabolism and myocardial hypoxic injury are a consequence of disrupted mitochondrial Mg 2+ level (Fig. 5 N).\n\nDPM enhances the hyperubiquitination and degradation of Mrs2 thus decreasing mitochondrial Mg 2 +\n\nThe uptake and efflux of mitochondrial Mg 2+ , mediated by transport proteins on mitochondrial membranes, directly control the mitochondrial Mg 2+ content [ 56 ]. Mitochondrial RNA splicing protein 2 (Mrs2) and solute carrier family 41 member 3 (Slc41a3) are currently recognized as the regulatory proteins responsible for the uptake and efflux of mitochondrial Mg 2+ , respectively [ 56 , 57 ]. To investigate the underlying mechanism of DPM-attenuated mitochondrial Mg 2+ , we examined the expressions of Mrs2 and Slc41a3. The heart of DPM-exposed mice showed a more significant decrease in the expression of Mrs2 than increase in the expression of Slc41a3 (Fig. 6 A), with a more significant change observed at high dose of DPM (Additional file 3 : Figure S11A), suggesting the major regulation of DPM-induced decrease of Mrs2. The consistent more significant alteration in Mrs2 was observed in the in vitro model (Fig. 6 B, Additional file 3 : Figure S11B). Taken together, these data suggest that Mrs2 exhibited a more critical role than Slc41a3.\n\nTo validate the key role of Mrs2 in DPM-attenuated mitochondrial Mg 2+ , we overexpressed Mrs2 in cardiomyocytes. Overexpression of Mrs2 in DPM-exposed cardiomyocytes partially restored the attenuated Mrs2 expression (Fig. 6 C, Additional file 3 : Figure S11C). Consistently, mitochondrial Mg 2+ deficiency in cardiomyocytes treated with DPM alone were partially restored by overexpression of Mrs2 (Fig. 6 D, Additional file 3 : Figure S11D,E). Furthermore, overexpression of Mrs2 also partially reversed the DPM-impaired mitochondrial aerobic metabolism, including ATP content (Fig. 6 E), and the expression of I-NDUFB8, II-SDHB, IV-COXII, and V-ATP5A (Fig. 6 F, Additional file 3 : Figure S11F). Additionally, overexpression of Mrs2 protected cardiomyocytes from DPM-induced hypoxia injury, as evidenced by the reduced expression of bax and cleaved-caspase3 (Fig. 6 G, Additional file 3 : Figure S11G). Therefore, DPM attenuated mitochondrial Mg 2+ through the inhibition on Mrs2.\n\nWe further investigated the underlying reasons for the decreased level of Mrs2 protein. We first evaluated the mRNA expression of Mrs2 and found that it was not affected by DPM exposure in either in vivo or in vitro models (Additional file 3 : Figure S12A,B). Subsequently, we assessed the degradation of Mrs2 and found that Mrs2 was regulated by the ubiquitination degradation pathway, as its protein level decreased in a time-dependent manner in the cardiomyocytes treated with cycloheximide (CHX), an inhibitor of protein synthesis (Additional file 3 : Figure S12C). However, the protein level of Mrs2 was stable in cardiomyocytes co-treated with CHX and ubiquitin–proteasome inhibitor (MG132) (Additional file 3 : Figure S12D). We therefore assessed the expression of ubiquitin after DPM exposure and found that DPM obviously increased the ubiquitin level (Fig. 6 H, Additional file 3 : Figure S12E). Further analysis revealed that DPM promoted the binding of Mrs2 to ubiquitin (Fig. 6 I) and that co-treatment of DPM with MG132 effectively alleviated DPM-reduced Mrs2 (Fig. 6 J, Additional file 3 : Figure S12F). In conclusion, our data point to that DPM enhanced the hyperubiquitination and degradation of Mrs2, leading to the decreased mitochondrial Mg 2+ level (Fig. 6 K).\n\nDiscussion\n\nIschemic heart disease (IHD) has always been a major cardiovascular health issue of public concern. In recent years, alongside the well-characterized risk factors such as metabolic and behavioral factors, the significance of environmental factors in IHD has garnered more attention [ 2 ]. Diesel particulate matter (DPM), with a widely exposed population and serving as a major contributor to the fourth environmental risk factor of IHD [ 8 , 12 ], emphasizing the imperative need to study relevant effect biomarkers and potential mechanisms to recognize and intervene DPM-related IHD. In our study, we constructed a population cohort with homogeneous DPM exposure history and a mice model exposed to occupational environmentally relevant doses of DPM. Based on the cohort and mice model, we reveal the myocardial hypertrophy and involved risks of hypoxia injury caused by DPM exposure and identify the attenuated mitochondrial aerobic metabolism of myocardial cells as a critical precursor biomarker. Moreover, we uncover that DPM-induced mitochondrial Mg 2+ deficiency in cardiomyocyte is a master regulator in DPM-impaired mitochondrial aerobic metabolism, which might be an intervention target for mitigating DPM-induced myocardial hypertrophy and hypoxia injury risks.\n\nPrevious studies have demonstrated the significant epidemiological associations between DPM exposure and an increased myocardial ischemic burden and IHD mortality risk [ 58 – 61 ], echoing the findings observed with PM exposure. For example, drivers, combination workers, and dockworkers regularly exposed to diesel exhaust showed increased risk of IHD mortality [ 59 ]. A Swedish case–control study established a link between occupational exposure to elemental carbon, a DPM constituent, and elevated IHD risk [ 60 ], while reduced DPM exposure among nonmetal miners was associated with a decline in IHD mortality risk [ 61 ]. Nonetheless, the complexity of exposure scenarios complicates the interpretation of these results, necessitating studies within populations with relatively single-exposure scenarios and exposure substances. In this study, we established a population cohort of diesel engine testers (DET), individuals with a relatively homogeneous history of DPM exposure, to investigate the cardiovascular health hazards of PM generated by diesel engine. The DET participants, who were engaged in diesel engine testing during the manufacturing process, experienced a consistent and stable exposure environment. Furthermore, the diesel engine testing process includes a variety of diesel engine operating power scenarios, which can cover the generation of particulate matter in different real-life diesel engine usage scenarios. Taken together, the DET cohort in this study minimized the interference from other pollutants, offering robust evidence linking DPM exposure to cardiac risk.\n\nOur results indicate that DPM exposure may increase the risk of adverse electrocardiogram events, which are indicative of myocardial hypertrophy and myocardial ischemia in humans (Fig. 2 B). Additionally, DPM impaired the SpO 2 post-exercise pressure, indicating a restricted oxygen transport and utilization capacity (Fig. 2 E). The DET cohort demonstrated a suggestive increase in the serum concentrations of biomarkers indicative of myocardial injury (Fig. 2 A, Additional file 2 : Table S1). However, attributing these elevations definitively to myocardial damage is complex, as the levels of markers such as MYO and CK may also be elevated secondary to skeletal muscle injury. Moreover, interpreting the significance of outcome changes is complicated by the confounding factors of chronic physical exertion and the potential health impacts associated with the occupational context of the workers [ 62 ]. To eliminate these confounding factors and obtain more detailed and in-depth data on the DPM-increased risk of myocardial hypertrophy and myocardial ischemia, a DPM-exposed mice model was applied. Individuals are generally exposed to PM derived from diesel engines for shorter durations and lower dosage. Consequently, it is essential to evaluate of the adverse cardiac effects caused by short-term exposure to DPM at different environmental doses, which has great practical significance. In this study, we developed a mouse model of short-term exposure to different occupational environmentally relevant doses DPM through tracheal infusion. Despite the limitations of tracheal infusion such as airway injury have been reported, it remains an important method for maintaining controlled exposure doses [ 63 ]. We set three exposure doses of low, medium, and high based on the occupational environmental DPM dose of three different occupational environments (diesel engine assembly, adjustment, and inspection). Furthermore, based on the conversion relationship between the mouse life cycle and human life cycle, a 12-day exposure cycle in mice has been set up, corresponding to short-term human exposure. Therefore, our study provides compelling evidence for the early effects of short-term exposure to DPM at different environmental doses. Mice exposed to DPM developed myocardial hypertrophy and showed a potential hypoxia state as indicated by increased HIF-1α (Fig. 3 F–H). However, the HIF-1α signaling in heart might be a direct effect of DPM on cardiomyocytes. To clarify whether the DPM exposure could cause a systemic hypoxic response, we extended our investigation to assess the hypoxic signaling activation in multiple organs other than the heart, including the kidney, spleen, liver, and lungs. The elevated HIF-1α protein levels in spleen, liver, and lung suggested that DPM exposure may indeed induce a systemic hypoxic state in mice (Additional file 3 : Figure S14).\n\nIdentifying representative or sensitive biomarkers for the earlier adverse cardiac health effects of DPM exposure facilitates the assessment of illness risk, enables prompt identification of affected individuals, and provides insights into potential intervention strategies. Based on the early effects of short-term exposure to occupational environmentally relevant doses of DPM in mice, we investigated the biomarkers of these initial events. Given the heart’s critical role in circulation and its unique energy metabolism pattern, which serves as a sensitive indicator of cardiac health [ 64 ], we focused on markers that reflect these processes. A prior study has suggested that free circulating mtDNA methylation, which regulates mitochondrial bioenergetics, may serve as a predictive biomarker for air pollution-caused CVD burden [ 65 ]. However, mtDNA is released from mitochondrial apoptosis/necrosis, making it a relatively late indicator of cardiac injury compared to direct changes in aerobic metabolism. Our study concentrated on the direct alterations in myocardial energy metabolism and identified that DPM exposure significantly inhibited the expression of oxidative phosphorylation and PDH, and the activity of ICDH enzyme in the hearts of mice (Fig. 4 C, Additional file 3 : Figure S9G,H). The detailed alterations in myocardial energy metabolism were further corroborated by our in vitro experiments (Fig. 4 D–F, Fig. 5 C–E). Furthermore, the activation of energy metabolism demonstrated that the inhibited aerobic metabolism by DPM was an early process leading to hypoxic injury (Fig. 4 G–J). Consequently, changes in the energy metabolism level of the heart hold the potential to serve as early biomarkers for identifying adverse cardiac health outcomes caused by DPM, including functional impairments and diseases. Overall, the results in our study provide valuable evidence for further exploring perturbations in aerobic energy metabolism as early biomarkers for adverse cardiac health events related to DPM or PM at the population level. Advanced detection techniques for cardiac energy metabolism, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), 18 F-FMISO hypoxia-specific radiotracer or 18 F-FDG glucose tracer PET-CT imaging, and phosphorus magnetic resonance spectroscopy ( 31 P-MRS) [ 66 – 69 ], could offer robust methodological support for future population-level studies.\n\nA previous study has delineated three primary mechanisms by which PM leads to cardiovascular impairments: PM-caused lung and systemic inflammation, the PM-activated autonomic nervous system, and direct injury to cardiomyocytes through particle translocation [ 70 ]. The primary route of PM impact on the heart is determined by particle size. PM with sizes between 0.65 and 4.7 μm can reach the trachea and bronchi, but rarely penetrate the pulmonary air-blood barrier [ 71 ]. Hence, these particles are more likely to affect the cardiovascular system indirectly. In contrast, PM smaller than 0.65 μm can enter the alveoli and be transported into the circulatory system, indicating a potential for direct contact and myocardial impact. Our previous study found that DPM has an average particle size of approximately 258.22 nm, suggesting its capacity for heart translocation. Studies using radiolabeling have investigated the distribution of inhaled DPM within the body and have shown that the heart is one of the organs to which DPM is translocated, with rates ranging from 1.30% ID g −1 at 1 h to 0.74% ID g −1 at 168 h [ 72 ]. Additionally, it has been reported that the clearance rate of particulate matter from the heart is low ( K = 0.480), second only to that from the brain ( K = 0.246), with the heart having a long half-life period (1.444 days) [ 73 ]. DPM particles were still detectable in the rat heart after exposure for 6, 18, 48, and 168 h [ 74 ]. Collectively, these findings suggest that DPM can enter the heart and that its toxic effects on the organ may persist longer than in other tissues. Therefore, we focused on the potential mechanism of DPM-inhibited aerobic energy metabolism through the direct impact. To simulate the direct contact between DPM and cardiomyocytes under the in vivo hypoxia condition, we constructed an in vitro DPM-induced myocardial hypoxia injury cell model by controlling the oxygen concentration. Cells from this model exhibited perturbations in aerobic energy metabolism similar to those observed in the myocardial tissue of mice exposed to DPM, indicating that this model is feasible for evaluating potential mechanisms of DPM-induced injury.\n\nAmong various mitochondrial ions, Ca 2+ has always been considered as a key ion directly involved in and regulating mitochondrial aerobic metabolism [ 75 ]. Moreover, recent studies have revealed that mitochondrial Mg 2+ mediates mitochondrial aerobic metabolism as a second messenger that affects the cell function and the vulnerability to impairment [ 29 , 76 , 77 ]. Focusing on the direct regulation of the mitochondrial Ca 2+ and Mg 2+ , we found that DPM exposure decreased the levels of both ions in mitochondria (Fig. 5 A,B, Additional file 3 : Figure S9A-C). Furthermore, it was demonstrated that the supplement of Mg 2+ rather than Ca 2+ could more effectively recover the impairment of mitochondrial aerobic metabolism and myocardial hypoxia injury caused by DPM, which further highlights the important role of mitochondrial Mg 2+ in cellular vulnerability to injury. The results of this study serve as a proof-of-concept that mitochondrial Mg 2+ affects the mitochondrial aerobic metabolism under DPM exposure and cellular vulnerability to injury, which might be a vital intervention target for DPM-related cardiac impairments. Mitochondrial Mg 2+ dynamically exchanges with free Mg 2+ in the cytoplasm which is regulated by the level of Mg 2+ in the cytoplasm and the influx and efflux of Mg 2+ on the mitochondrial membrane [ 56 ]. Similar to the decrease of mitochondrial Mg 2+ , cytoplasmic Mg 2+ also decreased in cardiomyocytes exposed to DPM (Additional file 3 : Figure S9A). Cytoplasmic Mg 2+ is associated with the influx and efflux of Mg 2+ across the cell membrane, wherein magnesium transporter 1 (Magt1, uptake Mg 2+ ) and solute carrier family 41 member A1 (Slc41a1, export Mg 2+ ) are the critical transporter [ 78 ]. We evaluated their expression and found a dynamic regulation of DPM on the levels of Magt1 and Slc41a1 proteins and related intracellular Mg 2+ level (Additional file 3 : Figure S13A-C). Throughout the 12-h period of DPM exposure, the Magt1 and Slc41a1 protein level changed in opposite trends, with 1, 3, and 12 h being critical time points (Additional file 3 : Figure S13B,C). The intracellular Mg 2+ always lag behind the changes of Magt1 and Slc41a1 protein level throughout the process (Additional file 3 : Figure S13A-C), indicating DPM may affect the intracellular Mg 2+ via the Magt1 and Slc41a1, which may be one of the reasons for the reduction in mitochondrial Mg 2+ (Additional file 3 : Figure S13D). Moreover, several studies have demonstrated the changed Mg 2+ in the extracellular environment could disturb the Magt1, Slc41a1, and cytoplasmic Mg 2+ [ 79 , 80 ]. The characterization of DPM components in our previous study showed that the contribution of Mg 2+ in DPM to the overall Mg 2+ level in the extracellular environment is minimal. Therefore, the supplementation of extracellular Mg 2+ in this study might lead to a saturation effect and help restore cytoplasmic Mg 2+ levels. Moreover, the decrease in Mrs2 abundance may not entirely abrogate Mrs2 function, and the remaining Mrs2 proteins may still be capable of importing Mg 2+ into the mitochondria. Elevated cytoplasmic Mg 2+ levels further contribute to mitochondrial Mg 2+ recovery through the residual Mrs2 activity. In addition, studies have clarified that the mitochondrial Mrs2 (Mg 2+ uptake) and Slc41a3 (Mg 2+ export) is the direct regulators of mitochondrial Mg 2+ [ 57 , 76 ]. Therefore, the DPM-induced significant reduction in Mrs2 was one of the reasons for the low mitochondrial Mg 2+ , which was also demonstrated by the overexpression of Mrs2.\n\nThe cellular protein level is mainly regulated by synthesis and degradation pathways [ 81 ]. No significant change was observed in Mrs2 gene expression induced by DPM (Additional file 3 : Figure S12A). Consequently, the degradation of Mrs2 might account for the decreased level. Ubiquitination-mediated degradation and lysosomal-mediated degradation are the main protein degradation pathways within cells [ 82 , 83 ]. Specifically, ubiquitination degradation is the main protein degradation pathway within cells, mainly through ubiquitin molecules and proteasomes. We found that the degradation of Mrs2 is influenced by ubiquitination degradation through the classic validation using the cycloheximide (protein synthesis inhibitor) and Mg132 (ubiquitination degradation pathway inhibitor). Furthermore, it was found that DPM elevates the level of ubiquitin protein and proves its involvement in the increased ubiquitination degradation of Mrs2. The ubiquitination degradation induced by DPM is opposite to the ubiquitination degradation inhibited by PM observed in previous studies [ 21 ], but similar to the ubiquitination degradation promoted by magnetic iron nanoparticle (MNP) in another study [ 84 ]. Considering the differences in particle size between DPM and PM 2.5 particles and the similarities between DPM and MNP, we speculate that this may be related to the particle size of the particles. On the other hand, although DPM is an important component of PM, there are still differences in their composition and size. Similar to MNP, DPM with size range at the nanoscale could enter the cell and damage mitochondria [ 85 ], which may lead to the injury of Mrs2, thus increasing the ubiquitination degradation pathway that regulates the clearance of damaged proteins in cells [ 86 ]. Therefore, the size differences may also be one of the reasons determining the different ubiquitination effects of DPM and PM 2.5 . Subsequent studies can further investigate by comparing typical particles with different particle sizes, such as carbon black particles and organic matter. Alternatively, further exploration can be conducted on the differential components of DPM and PM 2.5 , which may be a crucial starting point for understanding the critical components responsible for the adverse effects caused by DPM.\n\nThe limitations of this study are as follows: (1) Considering that people are generally exposed to diesel exhaust consisting of DPM and gas components, it is also important to completely investigate the impact of diesel exhaust in further studies, using a diesel exhaust exposure system. (2) Moreover, for the detection of oxygen consumption rate in vitro, both seahorse assay and O2k are established technique, in which O2k has specific high-resolution on assessing mitochondrial respiratory and seahorse has the potential to provide complementary data under certain conditions [ 87 ]. Subsequent investigations could benefit from employing both methods to achieve a more comprehensive analysis of cellular respiration. (3) Our research primarily focused on mitochondrial metabolic function; however, mitochondrial biogenesis is also a crucial aspect of mitochondrial biology. Subsequent studies investigating mitochondrial biogenesis could provide a more holistic understanding of mitochondrial function. Moreover, the experiment of DPM co-treated with rotenone and antimicynA will further help to clarify whether the primary mechanism of DPM-mediated damage is connected to OXPHOS. (4) Beside to the cardiomyocyte, immune cells are also sensitive to the environmental pollutant exposure and mitochondrial aerobic metabolism play vital roles in their functions [ 88 , 89 ]. Therefore, determining whether mitochondrial aerobic metabolism could be used as a marker for DPM exposure in circulating cells might be another interested research direction. (5) As other important regulators of Mg 2+ transport, the potential role of altered Slc41a3, Slc41a1, and Magt1 levels in the low mitochondrial Mg 2+ also needs to be further investigated in further studies.\n\nConclusions\n\nIn summary, our study reveals the risks and characteristics of myocardial hypertrophy and ischemia induced by DPM, a non-negligible environmental risk factor, with impairment of mitochondrial aerobic metabolism might be a precursor effect biomarker. Moreover, we found that DPM exposure limited the mitochondrial influx of Mg 2+ through the over-ubiquitination and degradation of Mrs2, thus impairing mitochondrial Mg 2+ involved in the mitochondrial aerobic metabolism and aggravating vulnerability of myocardial cells to hypoxia injury. Specifically activating the mitochondrial aerobic metabolism using EGCG or supplementing with Mg 2+ , as revealed in this study, might be a potential investigative avenue for mitigating DPM-induced cardiovascular risks.\n\nSupplementary Information\n\nAdditional file 1.
