  "abstract": "Background: The clinical outcomes of comparing covered stents (CSs) and drug‐coated balloons (DCBs) angioplasty in femoropopliteal artery occlusion remain unknown. This study aimed to evaluate the midterm efficacy of CS and DCB procedures in patients with FPO.\n\nMethods: All 194 patients were divided into CS (94 patients) and DCB (100 patients) groups in this multicenter retrospective study. The primary end point was primary patency at 24 months, and the secondary end points included freedom from clinically driven target lesion revascularization, limb salvage, major adverse events, and overall survival rates. Propensity score matching analysis was performed to reconfirm the main end points.\n\nResults: Compared with the patients in the DCB group, those in the CS group had a lower prevalence of smoking (54.3% versus 74.0%, P =0.004) and diabetes (38.3% versus 66.0%, P <0.001) before propensity score matching. Compared with the DCB procedure, the CS procedure resulted in a significantly greater primary patency at 24 months (74.4% versus 55.8%, P =0.019), with comparable primary patency at 12 months; similar results were obtained after matching. However, there was no difference in terms of clinically driven target lesion revascularization, limb salvage, major adverse events, or overall survival rates. Subgroup analyses confirmed the superior clinical patency of CS in patients with diabetes ( P =0.010) and proximal reference vessel diameter ≥5.0 mm ( P =0.038). A baseline ankle brachial index <0.40 was likely to be an independent risk factor for restenosis, and a postprocedural ankle brachial index ≥0.80 and the CS used (hazard ratio [HR], 0.54 [95% CI, 0.32–0.91], P =0.021) were potential protective factors for restenosis after multivariate analysis.\n\nConclusions: Compared with the DCB procedure, the CS procedure resulted in greater primary patency at 24 months in complicated femoropopliteal artery occlusion lesions.",

The data are available from the corresponding author upon reasonable request.\n\nStudy Design and Population\n\nThis study is a multicenter retrospective study including patients with chronic total femoropopliteal occlusion who underwent endovascular therapy at 7 centers from January 2020 to December 2022. All patients with symptoms of lower limbs were eligible and diagnosed via computed tomography angiography and then received endovascular therapy via digital subtraction angiography. This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the First Affiliated Hospital of Xi'an Jiaotong University with a waiver for informed consent due to the retrospective design, and all treatment measures and follow‐up procedures were in accordance with relevant clinical guidelines and institutional regulations.\n\nA total of 283 patients were considered and of them, 197 patients were included according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria, and 194 were ultimately included in this study without loss to follow‐up (Figure 1 , The ratio of the CS: DCB was 1:1). Ninety‐four patients were treated with heparin‐bonded CSs, and 100 patients were treated with DCB angioplasty. The clinical data from medical records, including demographic baseline data, lesion characteristics, complications, and outcome data, were collected anonymously.\n\nThe inclusion and exclusion criteria for patient selection were as follows.\n\nInclusion criteria: Patient age: ≥18 years At least 1 below‐the‐knee runoff vessel 2 to 6 classes in the Rutherford category Length of the target lesion: at least 5 cm, up to 30 cm Inflow artery stenosis <30% Diagnosed with lower extremity arteriosclerosis obliterans Procedure experience of the performing physician >100 cases\n\nExclusion criteria:\n\nArterial embolism of the lower extremity; Inflow artery stenosis ≥50% or inflow not successfully treated Distal outflow occlusions to the target lesion Previous major amputation of the limb In‐stent reocclusion of the target limb Severe target limb or systemic infection Anticipated life expectancy <1 year Hypersensitivity or contraindications to paclitaxel, antiplatelet, or anticoagulation therapy Occlusion involving the common femoral artery or beyond the P2 segment of the popliteal artery Other contraindications to anesthesia or the procedure\n\nProcedures and Medical Therapy\n\nAll participating physicians from each center had a technical training experience in treatment of FPO through endovascular interventions such as CS, DCB, DES, or other adjuvant procedures in the main research center (the hospital of corresponding author) for at least 6 months. Additionally, when dealing with complex lesions whose treatment options were controversial, preoperative discussions were routinely conducted by our cooperative team composed of multiple centers, to determine the optimal treatment strategy that maximized the clinical benefits for patients. During the endovascular procedure, a 6‐ or 7‐F sheath was inserted into the femoral artery under local anesthesia using the antegrade access of the contralateral approach (or the ipsilateral approach when the ipsilateral femoral artery was available). After systemic heparization, a 0.035‐, 0.018‐ or 0.014‐inch guidewire was used to cross the target lesion, and then the guidewire was confirmed to be in the distal true lumen via angiography. In the case of reentry difficulty, retrograde puncture from the distal target vessel was performed to recanalize the target lesion.\n\nIn the CS procedure, ordinary balloon catheters were used to predilate the lesion, followed by the placement of a heparin‐bonded covered stent (W.L. Gore & Associates, Flagstaff, AZ) from distal to proximal with minimal oversizing. A full‐coverage strategy using only a CS was the preferred procedure, and postdilatation was performed with a plain balloon after CS placed. Patients in the DCB procedure were predilated via stepped plain balloon angioplasty, then the DCB (IN. PACT Admiral, Medtronic, Minneapolis, MN; Lutonix, CR Bard, Murray Hill, NJ; Orchid, Acotec Scientific, Beijing, China) was used for the final angioplasty. In addition, bailout stenting was performed using bare metal stents if flow‐limiting dissection or recoil (>30%) occurred after DCB angioplasty.\n\nAll patients received dual antiplatelet therapy consisting of aspirin (100 mg/d) and clopidogrel (75 mg/d) for at least 3 days before the procedure and then continued for 3 months, and statins (20 mg/d) were given for lipid‐lowering therapy, followed by long‐term oral single antiplatelet drug and statin therapy. If the patient is resistant to aspirin or clopidogrel, a second‐line antiplatelet drug is recommended (cilostazol, 200 mg/d; sagrelate, 300 mg/d; or beraprost sodium, 120 μg/d).\n\nAssessments and Definitions\n\nFollow‐up examinations were scheduled at 30 days and 6, 12, and 24 months after the initial procedure. Follow‐up data, including clinical symptoms, Rutherford category, ankle brachial index (ABI), and results of duplex ultrasound or computed tomography angiography, were recorded to assess the patency of treated vessels at each follow‐up point.\n\nThe primary end point was primary patency of target vessels after the procedure, which was defined as the absence of clinically driven target lesion revascularization (CD‐TLR) or binary restenosis (<50%). Restenosis was defined as a peak systolic velocity ratio >2.4 evaluated by duplex ultrasound or stenosis >50% based on angiography. 7 The secondary end points were freedom from CD‐TLR, limb salvage (freedom from major amputation), and overall survival (freedom from all‐cause mortality). CD‐TLR was defined as reintervention performed for ≥50% diameter stenosis or occlusion after the recurrence or deterioration of symptoms following the initial procedure. 14 Major amputation was considered any above‐ankle amputation. The combined safety end point was major adverse events, including myocardial infarction, stroke, death, CD‐TLR, and major amputation during follow‐up.\n\nReference vessel diameter (RVD) was measured via computed tomography angiography or duplex ultrasound before operation. Technical success was defined as residual stenosis <30% without flow‐limiting dissection in the treated lesions by angiography. Complications at the vascular access site and post procedure were also recorded. The degree of calcification was assessed by using the proposed peripheral arterial calcium‐scoring system, 15 which includes grades 0 to 4; grades 0 and 1 were defined as non‐/mild calcification; grade 2 was defined as moderate calcification; and grades 3 and 4 were defined as severe calcification.\n\nStatistical Analysis\n\nData on baseline characteristics are presented as mean±SD for continuous variables and frequency (percentage) for categorical variables. The differences in baseline characteristics between groups were crudely tested by Welch's t test for continuous variables and by chi‐square test or Fisher's exact test for categorical variables.\n\nWhen clinical outcomes were compared, propensity score matching (PSM) was used to reduce the impact of confounding factors and selection bias. All baseline patient characteristics including sex, age, body mass index, Rutherford category, baseline ABI, smoking, drinking, coronary atherosclerotic disease, stroke, hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipemia, hyperhomocysteinemia, history of endovascular therapy and medication used, and all lesion characteristics including proximal and distal RVD, lesion length, TASC II classification, peripheral arterial calcium‐scoring system grade, and below‐the‐knee runoff vessels were used as explanatory variables for matching. A nearest‐neighbor matching algorithm with a caliper of 0.2 SD was used to develop propensity score‐matched pairs without replacement (1:1 match). After matching, the intergroup differences were tested by the paired t test for continuous variables and by McNemar test for categorical variables. The time–to‐event rates were estimated using the Kaplan–Meier method and compared by log‐rank test. To confirm risk factors for restenosis, univariate Cox hazard regression analyses for all baseline characteristics were performed first, and then a multivariate Cox model including potential or important risk factors was constructed with a supported outcome obtained from the proportional hazards assumption assessed using the Schoenfeld residuals method; the results were presented as hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs. P values <0.05 were considered statistically significant.\n\nAll the statistical analyses were performed using IBM SPSS, version 22.0 (IBM Corporation, New York), and the PSM and the establishment and assumption testing of Cox model were performed using R 4.4.1 software (R Development Core Team, Vienna, Austria).\n\nRESULTS\n\nBaseline Characteristics\n\nFinally, there were 194 patients included in this study (Figure 1 ). The baseline characteristics of patients and lesions were presented before and after PSM (Tables 1 and 2 ). The CS procedure had a lower prevalence of smoking (54.3% versus 74.0%, P =0.004) and diabetes (38.3% versus 66.0%, P <0.001) before matching. No significant differences were confirmed in the other or lesion characteristics between 2 groups. The mean lengths of lesions were 156.5±87.7 mm and 153.0±55.1 mm in the CS and DCB procedures, and most of them were complicated TASC C/D (79.8% versus 78.0%) and severe calcification lesions (30.8% versus 30.0%; all P >0.05). Moreover, 18 patients (18.0%) in the DCB group underwent bailout stenting.\n\nPSM revealed 49 pairs (49 CS cases and 49 DCB cases), with no remarkable intergroup differences in all baseline characteristics (Tables 1 and 2 ).\n\nProcedural Clinical and Safety Outcomes\n\nThe median follow‐up time was 31.0 months (interquartile range, 22.0–36.0 months). Clinical outcomes, including access and postprocedural complications, were shown in Table 3 . The majority of patients in the CS and DCB groups improved at least 1 level in Rutherford category after procedures (89.4% versus 91.0%, P =0.70), and the improvement in postprocedural ABI compared with baseline ABI was significant respectively in the 2 groups ( P <0.001), without between‐group differences.\n\nAs shown in Figure 2A , the CS procedure resulted in significantly greater primary patency at 24 months than DCB (74.4%±4.6% versus 55.8%±5.3%, P =0.019). A similar trend was observed at 12 months, although not significantly (81.5%±4.1% versus 68.4±4.7%, P =0.063). Similarly, greater primary patency was also confirmed in the CS group at 24 months after PSM (76.8% versus 50.0%, P =0.016; Figure 3A ). The rates of freedom from CD‐TLR were comparable between CS and DCB procedures at 12 months (85.8% versus 85.6%, P >0.05) and 24 months (81.0% versus 77.2%, P >0.05, Figure 2B ). Limb salvage (97.7% versus 97.0%) and overall survival (89.4% versus 84.3%) were also comparable at 24 months (Figure 2C,D ; P >0.05), and similar trends were confirmed after matched analysis (Figure 3B through 3D ; P >0.05).\n\nThe cumulative major adverse events during the follow‐up period were similar with no differences confirmed in cumulative stroke, myocardial infarction, or death between CS and DCB procedures (Table 3 ; all P >0.05).\n\nSubgroup Analysis\n\nNo difference of primary patency between CS and DCB on the long length lesion (>200 mm, P >0.05; Figure 4A ), and the KM analysis revealed a trend toward greater patency in the CS procedure than DCB in TASC C/D (73.2% versus 57.4%, P =0.070, Figure 4B ), severe calcification (80.4% versus 57.1%, P =0.075, Figure 4C ), and distal RVD ≥4.5 mm lesions (71.6% versus 55.3%, P =0.070, Figure 4E ). Moreover, primary patency was superior in the CS procedure for lesions with a proximal RVD ≥5.0 mm (71.3% versus 49.9%, P =0.038; Figure 4D ), especially in patients with diabetes (82.7% versus 54.4%, P =0.010, Figure 4F ).\n\nRisk Factors for Restenosis\n\nSeven significant potential risk factors for restenosis were identified via univariate Cox regression analysis and then were used to construct this multivariable Cox model (shown in Table 4 ). A baseline ABI <0.40 (HR, 1.68 [95% CI, 1.00–2.81]) tended to be an independent risk factor for restenosis though P =0.05. The postprocedural ABI ≥0.80 (HR, 0.59 [95% CI, 0.36–0.99], P =0.046) and the CS used (HR, 0.54 [95% CI, 0.32–0.91], P =0.021) were potential protective factors for restenosis.\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nTo the best of our knowledge, this study is one of the first and the largest multicenter retrospective studies comparing the CS and DCB procedures in the treatment of complicated FPO lesions, in view of the lack of relevant prospective trials or RCTs currently. Plenty of published studies have already evaluated CS or DCB with standard angioplasty respectively and confirmed superior clinical results in the former. 6 , 16 However, direct comparison of both is seldom reported; therefore, we chose the head‐to‐head way to better compare these two mainstream procedures.\n\nIn this study, we confirmed CS was the procedure associated with greater 24‐month primary patency (74.4% versus 55.8%), and the results remained consistent after PSM adjustment for confounding baseline characteristics. The latest 2‐center retrospective study 17 demonstrated that the CS procedure resulted in significantly higher primary patency rates at 12 and 24 months than the DCB procedure (75.8% versus 39.2%, 64.1% versus 31.9%), and similar results were obtained from KM curves in this study. The higher primary patency at 24 months was identified in CS while this trend appeared at 12 months, although no statistical difference. Therefore, our results demonstrated that the patency of DCB was lower for complicated FPO lesions and that the CS procedure might be a suitable therapeutic option for complicated and challenging lesions. A multicenter, prospective, real‐world VANQUISH (Viabahn Stent‐Graft Placement for Femoropopliteal Diseases Requiring Endovascular Therapy) study 18 demonstrated that the primary patency at 12 months was 80.3%, with a full coverage method for complicated patients. Ichihashi et al. 12 reported that the 2‐year primary patency of the CS procedure was 69.5% for long lesions (23.0±6.9 cm) after PSM analysis. Furthermore, the newly comparative study between DCB and DES tended to indicate a greater durable patency result in the latter, 10 probably due to the support effect of scaffold in complicated, severely calcified FPO lesions, which was in line with our finding of similar effect in CS.\n\nCS is a novel flexible, self‐expanding graft stent consisting of an external scaffold lined with the expanded polytetrafluoroethylene membrane that extends along the stent with covalently bonded bioactive heparin on surface. 16 , 19 In the CS, the biocompatible porous expanded polytetrafluoroethylene membrane acts as a mechanical barrier against neointimal hyperplasia that encroaches the vessel lumen, fully covering target lesions regardless of length, 18 , 20 which could be used for artery injury repair in the case of full dilation of severe calcification vessels, and the metal scaffold can overcome external forces from the calcified vascular wall and provide adequate radial pressure to prevent elastic recoil. 21 , 22 In addition, the heparin immobilized on surface was confirmed to be associated with superior clinical and patency benefits in heparin‐bonded CS. 19 Another study indicated that more aggressive antiplatelet/anticoagulation regimens improved primary patency and reintervention after CS placement. 23 Recently, VOYAGER PAD (Vascular Outcomes Study of ASA [Acetylsalicylic Acid] Along With Rivaroxaban in Endovascular or Surgical Limb Revascularization for Peripheral Artery Disease) RCT showed the clinical benefit of rivaroxaban combined with aspirin in patients undergoing lower limb revascularization. 24 As a result, we believed several factors might potentially explain the separation of KM curves in primary patency of CS compared with DCB, which means CS is more suitable for complicated FPO lesions. 12 , 13 , 21\n\nRegarding to DCB, although primary patency rates differed in 2 procedures, the rates of freedom from CD‐TLR in this study were comparable at 24 months (81.0% versus 77.2%), which is favorable and consistent with the findings of previous studies. 10 , 11 , 12 , 21 Ye et al. 17 reported that the adjusted freedom from CD‐TLR was not significantly different between 2 groups. The DCB procedure inhibits early restenosis, but the antiproliferation effect does not maintain for a long time; thus, long‐term loss of patency reflects the progression of disease or losing efficacy in DCB. That is another controversial issue on whether a single‐dose, single short contact treatment could deliver sufficient therapeutic effect for a long time, considering in treatment of complicated FPO lesions while DES could continuously supply drugs. 25 , 26 Moreover, severe calcification lesions can prevent drug absorption, especially without atherectomy devices used. These would be part of reasons that DCB performed poorly in the gradual separation of patency KM curves with time. Therefore, the long‐term outcomes of DCB might be affected by its technical and biological features, which means CS displayed a superior clinical patency by contrast. However, in other hand, neointimal proliferation mainly occurring at the edges of stents and in‐stent thrombosis also trouble CS, 27 which may lead to procedure failure with early reintervention, resulting into a similar freedom from CD‐TLR KM curve with DCB. Although CS had a higher midterm primary patency than DCB, there were comparable freedom from CD‐TLR with no difference in rates of limb salvage, overall survival or major adverse events before and after PSM. Based on this analysis, we confirmed that CS was superior to DCB alone in the treatment of complicated FPO lesions. The combination of DCB and atherectomy reported currently may lead to better results. 28 Therefore, our study further recommended that in such lesions, CS or DES may be a better choice if no debulking devices applied; conclusions need to be further confirmed by RCTs.\n\nPrevious studies have reported that CS is likely to overcome the influences of major risk factors such as long lesions, total occlusion, and severe calcification, with the exception of vessel diameter, which seems to be the only risk factor for patency loss in the CS procedure; however, these challenges and difficulties still remained in the DCB procedure. 14 , 18 In our study, greater patency of the CS procedure was found in patients with TASC C/D, severe calcification, larger proximal and distal RVD lesions, and diabetes. Despite promising data on the DCB procedure as the first‐line treatment for PAD, published studies have indicated decreased patency for challenging complicated FPO lesions (chronic total occlusion, severe calcification, etc.). 8 , 29 A small vessel is another well‐known risk factor for restenosis after femoropopliteal procedures 18 and becomes a restriction for CS implantation. 17 Our results suggested that the CS procedure resulted in better outcomes for lesions with proximal diameter >5 mm, further confirming this view. Furthermore, our study revealed that patients with diabetes treated with CSs rather than DCBs presented relatively superior patency. Diabetes increases claudication by 2‐ to 3‐fold and worsens outcomes by increasing the risk of critical limb ischemia, amputation, and mortality. 1 , 30 , 31 A 5‐year DCB post hoc analysis revealed a higher mortality rate in patients with diabetes, 32 whereas studies comparing CS and DCB procedures in the diabetic population are limited.\n\nIt is likely that a baseline ABI <0.40, as an independent risk factor for restenosis in this study, often indicates severe symptoms and greater atherosclerotic burden and is correlated with poor long‐term patency. This finding was consistent with available scientific data, which indicated that a value of <0.5 was a strong predictor of adverse events affecting patency after angioplasty, 33 whereas our study approximated the cutoff value to 0.4 in a further step. Similarly, a postprocedural ABI ≥0.80, as a protective factor in this study, could be used to evaluate the treatment effect of endovascular recanalization, which has proven the efficacy of the procedure in target vessels. A published report indicated that the higher postprocedural ABI was associated with superior limb salvage, 34 which was in line with our results from a certain perspective. Although we obtained supporting evidence for the CS procedure, limitations still exist because we did not consider the application of debulking devices. Proper vessel preparation including modified balloons and atherectomy could significantly reduce the occurrence of flow‐limiting dissection, increase the effective lumen, and thus improve clinical outcomes potentially in complicated lesions. 35 , 36 Therefore, a combination of multiple endovascular technologies encouraging the appropriate use of vessel preparation rather than a specific single device would probably be needed to find the optimal treatment strategy in addressing complicated FPO lesions through longer term prospective studies, especially RCTs.\n\nLimitations\n\nThere were several limitations in this study. First, this study was a retrospective rather than a prospective or RCT study, in addition, it was a midterm instead of long‐term study because most of longer term data were not collected and followed up, and the limited sample size might affect the overall value of the study. Second, the different pricing strategies of CS and DCB devices in our region (CS is more expensive) may also have affected the outcomes. Third, the current study did not collect detailed data about the use of intravascular ultrasound in stent placement, DCB procedure, and vessel diameter measurement, which might affect the accuracy and generality of the results. Last but not least, this study did not involve the use of debulking such as atherectomy, which might affect the determination of the optimal endovascular therapy strategy. Therefore, the conclusions need to be verified via prospective long‐term randomized trials in the future.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nCompared with the DCB procedure, the CS procedure resulted in greater primary patency at 24 months in the treatment of complicated FPO lesions, especially in the subgroup of patients with diabetes and lesions with proximal RVD ≥5.0 mm. However, more studies are necessary to assess the outcomes of various strategies thoroughly and identify the most beneficial therapy choice for patients with FPO.\n\nSources of Funding\n\nThis project was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 82370459).\n\nDisclosures\n\nNone.",
