  "abstract": "Background and goals of the study: Adherence to lung-protective ventilation leads to a lower incidence of perioperative pulmonary complications. However, adherence is reported to be only approximately 15% worldwide. Therefore, we conducted a prospective interventional clinical pre-post study to assess the impact of a standardized operating procedure (SOP) enhanced with a mandatory educational programme on adherence to intraoperative lung protective ventilation (IOLPV).\n\nMaterials and methods: First, we assessed the current level of adherence to the IOLPV concept (Group A - before SOP). Thereafter, we implemented the SOP enhanced with a mandatory educational programme. When the program finished, our team assessed the new adherence level to the LPV concept (Group B – after SOP). We compared the number of cases that abided by each IOLPV recommendation and the number of cases that abided by the whole IOLPV bundle between the groups.\n\nResults: A total of 164 patients were enrolled (Group A 82, Group B 82) in the study. The number of procedures with adherence to the whole IOLPV bundle was significantly greater in Group B (Group A, 4%; Group B, 24%; p < 0.001). Similarly, the total number of recruitment manoeuvres performed was significantly greater in Group B than in Group A (Group A 11, Group B 35, p < 0.001). The mean positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) was likewise significantly greater in Group B than in Group A (Group A, 6.6 ± 1.88 mbar; Group B, 7.8 ± 2.10 mbar; p < 0.001), leading to significantly more cases with an abiding level of PEEP, as recommended in Group B, than in Group A (Group A, 22; Group B, 49; p < 0.001). There was no significant difference between the groups in terms of the number of cases that abided by the plateau, the driving pressure, the tidal volume, or the breathing frequency.\n\nConclusions: The SOP enhanced with a mandatory educational program focused on IOLPV may be an effective tool for increasing adherence to IOLPV in daily practice.\n\nTrial registration: The study has been preregistered in registry clinicaltrials.gov and assigned the study registration number NCT05831683 with the brief title “Standard Operating Procedure as a Valuable Tool to Increase Adherence to Lung Protective Ventilation among Anaesthesiologists”.

  "full_text": "Background\n\nMechanical ventilation can contribute to perioperative pulmonary complications (PPCs) through multiple mechanisms, including ventilation-induced lung injury (VILI) and atelectasis [ 1 ]. PPCs are among the most common complications of general anaesthesia [ 2 , 3 ]. This markedly impacts morbidity, mortality, length of ICU stays and healthcare costs. Recent papers reported that 23% of individuals undergoing general anaesthesia experience PPC [ 4 ]. Several studies indicate that adjusting ventilator settings during general anaesthesia can substantially reduce the incidence of PPC [ 5 – 13 ]. The concept of intraoperative lung protective ventilation (IOLPV) embodies a comprehensive set of guidelines aimed at optimizing ventilator settings to lower the risk of PPC development. IOLPV includes three major strategies: low tidal volume (6–8 ml/KG IBW), PEEP (4–10 cmH2O) and recruitment manoeuvres [ 13 , 14 ]. IOLPV has been recognized as the gold standard of care for more than two decades; however, compliance among anaesthesiologists with this concept remains very low [ 15 – 17 ].\n\nOne promising strategy to bolster adherence to IOLPV principles may be the adoption of a standardized operating procedure (SOP) enhanced with an educational programme. A comparable approach has previously demonstrated success in improving adherence to perioperative management in colorectal surgery and to other guidelines and recommendations [ 18 – 21 ].\n\nThis knowledge raised the question, whether a SOP with educational program could be a tool to increase adherence to IOLPV. Therefore, we conducted this interventional study. We hypothesized that the implementation of the SOP regarding IOLPV enhanced with an educational program would lead to an increased compliance with IOLPV strategy.\n\nMethods and materials\n\nStudy design\n\nThe study was designed as a prospective, pre-postintervention, unblinded study with one month of preintervention clinical data collection, one month of intervention and one month of postintervention clinical data collection, as depicted in Fig. 1 . Data were collected from the 20th of April 2023 until the 18th of July 2023. The study was approved by the ethics committee (Ethics Committee, Masaryk Hospital Ustí nad Labem, Czech Republic; reference code 313/3). The study was conducted in accordance with the Helsinki Declaration and good clinical practice. The consent to participate was obtained from all participants. The study was preregistered and assigned the study registration number NCT05831683.\n\nObjectives\n\nThe primary objective of the study was to prove that the implementation of the SOP regarding IOLPV enhanced with a mandatory educational program will lead to an increased number of cases that abide by IOLPV recommendations.\n\nThe secondary objectives were to prove that the implementation of the SOP regarding IOLPV enhanced with a mandatory educational program will lead to an increased number of cases where the mean PEEP is more than or equal to 8 cmH2O (the recommended PEEP for nonthoracic general anaesthesia in the literature ranges from 4 to 10 cmH2O; we chose 8 cmH2O for the initial PEEP setting in our SOP regarding the IOLPV [ 13 , 14 ]), and that the implementation of the SOP regarding IOLPV enhanced with a mandatory educational program will lead to an increased number of cases in which RCM (recruitment manoeuvre) is used.\n\nStudy site description\n\nThe study took place at Masaryk Hospital in Ustí nad Labem, Czech Republic. This is the tertiary hospital centre that serves the North Bohemian region. The long-term average number of surgical procedures performed under general anaesthesia per year is up to 16 000. Clinicians in the Department of Anaesthesia at Masaryk Hospital knew about ongoing study but did not possess knowledge of the objectives of the study or the recorded variables.\n\nIntervention\n\nThe intervention in this study was designed to implement an SOP regarding IOLPV enhanced with an educational programme. The SOP consists of the initial ventilator setting (for details, see Table 1 ), the PEEP titration recommendation, and the recruitment manoeuvre manual (for details, see Tables 2 and 3 ). The recommended approach for PEEP titration was to use the built-in step-down PEEP titration function of the GE Healthcare Aysis CS 2 , which identifies the optimal PEEP level that is associated with the highest respiratory system compliance.\n\nAfter the preintervention phase the SOP was introduced to all the clinicians in the Department of Anaesthesia. Thereafter, mandatory educational program with a focus on IOLPV started. This educational programme consists of 11 half-hour-long lectures. The themes of the lectures were as follows: general anaesthesia induction, preoxygenation, PEEP intraoperatively, IOLPV concept and perioperative pulmonary complications, IOLPV in specific situations, IOLPV during laparoscopy, IOLPV during robotics surgery, IOLPV in pronation, recruitment manoeuvres during general anaesthesia, emergence from anaesthesia and extubating, neuromuscular blockade depth monitoring, and monitoring of the depth of anaesthesia and analgesia. The lectures had a 1:10 teacher–student ratio. Lectures were thought in person. All the lectures were theoretical except the lecture regarding RCM during general anaesthesia. This lecture was thought practically with hands-on simulation using a ventilation simulator ASL 5000 manufactured by IngMar Medical (Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA). Each lecture included an oral evaluation at the end of the lecture. The teachers were members of the study team with wide experience in LPV, including IOLPV. All the teachers were certified as lectors in anaesthesiology and intensive care medicine.\n\nMeasures\n\nWe assessed the effect of the intervention with six observational measures. Data collection was performed via the Carestation Insights Analytics Applications software developed by GE HealthCare (Madison, Wisconsin, USA). Using this software, the data were collected automatically directly from ventilatory to cloud based data storage. In this study, only Aysis CS2 anaesthesia machines made by GE HealthCare (Madison, Wisconsin, USA) were used to administer general anaesthesia. The measures used were as follows: positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP), tidal volume in millilitres per kilogram of ideal body weight (IBW), driving pressure in mbar, plateau pressure in mbar, end tidal carbon dioxide in kPa, and recruitment manoeuvre procedure usage.\n\nPositive end expiratory pressure (PEEP)\n\nPEEP between 4 and 10 cmH2O is recommended to prevent PPC [ 6 , 13 , 14 , 22 – 25 ]. We compared the number of patients with a mean PEEP higher or equal to 8 cmH2O between the preintervention and postintervention phases.\n\nTidal volume\n\nVentilation with a low tidal volume (6–8 ml/kg IBW) in combination with moderate to high PEEP prevents ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI) and lowers lung inflammation in comparison with ventilation with a conventional tidal volume (10 ml/kg IBW) [ 6 , 8 – 10 , 13 , 24 – 29 ]. We compared the number of patients with a mean tidal volume of 6–8 ml/kg IBW between the preintervention and postintervention phases.\n\nDriving pressure\n\nTo prevent lung inflammation, the onset of VILI, and PPC, it is recommended not to exceed the driving pressure of 15 cmH2O [ 6 , 22 , 23 , 30 , 31 ]. We compared the number of patients whose mean driving pressure was lower than 15 cmH2O between the preintervention and postintervention phases.\n\nPlateau pressure\n\nA plateau pressure exceeding 30 cmH2O is linked with lung inflammation and a higher incidence of VILI and PPC [ 5 , 6 , 32 ]. We compared the number of patients whose mean plateau pressure was less than 30 cmH2O between the preintervention and postintervention phases (subgroups of patients in which the volume control ventilation mode was used).\n\nEnd tidal carbon dioxide\n\nETCO₂ is closely linked to minute ventilation: as minute ventilation increases, ETCO₂ decreases [ 33 ]. Therefore, low ETCO₂ levels may indicate excessive minute ventilation. Overventilation can result from an increased tidal volume, a high respiratory rate, or both—leading to unnecessary increases in mechanical power. To assess this, we compared the number of patients with ETCO₂ values between 36 and 44 mmHg during the preintervention and postintervention phases.\n\nRecruitment manoeuvre\n\nRecruitment manoeuvres are another pillar of the IOLPV concept alongside low tidal volume and PEEP between 4 and 10 cmH2O [ 5 , 6 , 13 , 14 , 34 , 35 ]. We compared the total number of cases in which RMs were used, the number of cases in which RMs were used after induction, the number of cases where RMs were used after induction and during the case, and the number of cases where the exit PEEP was greater than 5 cmH2O between the preintervention and postintervention phases. The RMs in our study were all multistep and automatically delivered by an anaesthesia machine with a predefined scenario; for details, see Table 3 .\n\nCompetence of investigators\n\nWe defined the degree of competency of the investigators as follows: performing more than 3000 general anaesthesia procedures, having a duration of clinical practice in the respiratory ICU of more than 5 years, and having a lecture about LPV and the IOLPV concept for more than a year.\n\nAnalysis\n\nA sample size of 158 subjects was calculated to identify a 20% difference in the primary outcome between the two groups, with 95% power and a cut-off for statistical significance of p = 0,05. The normality of the data was evaluated via the Shapiro‒Wilk test. Differences in categorical variables were standardly evaluated via the chi-square test and the Pearson coefficient. Comparisons of two continuous variables were performed via t tests for independent samples. All calculations were performed in the open-source R environment (v4.1.2, R Core Team (2021)). R: A language and environment for statistical computing. R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria, https://www.R-project.org/ ).\n\nResults\n\nA total of 164 patients met the inclusion criteria, of whom 79 (48.17%) underwent general anaesthesia before the introduction of the SOP (Group A), 3 (1,83%) patients were excluded for incomplete data sets, and the remaining 82 (50%) patients underwent general anaesthesia after the SOP introduction (Group B). Half of the patients were treated for neurosurgical indications (50.31%), followed by 36.02% for gynaecological cases and, finally, 13.66% for patients who were treated for different indications. There was a significantly greater ideal body weight in group A ( p < 0.001), and patients were significantly older in group A ( p < 0.001). The demographics is presented in Table 4 .\n\nWe observed significantly higher adherence to the whole LPV bundle in Group B compared to Group A (Group A 3, Group B 19; p < 0.001). Similarly, we observed significantly greater mean PEEP in the Group B compared to Group A (Group A, 6.6; Group B, 7.8; p < 0.001), leading to significantly more cases that abide by recommendation criteria for the mean PEEP in Group B (Group A, 22; Group B, 49; p < 0,001). There was no significant difference between the groups in the number of patients who abided by other ventilatory parameter recommendations. See Table 5 for detailed statistics of the number of cases that met the recommended criteria.\n\nThe introduction of the SOP increased the total number of recruitment manoeuvres used (Group A, 11; Group B, 35; p < 0.001) and the number of RCMs performed within the first ten minutes after securing the airway (Group A, 6; Group B, 21; p = 0.002). The number of patients with exit PEEP values above 5 cmH2O significantly increased in the group after the introduction of SOP ( p < 0.001). See Table 6 for a detailed demonstration of the total number of RCMs and cases with exit PEEP above 5 cmH2O.\n\nDiscussion\n\nThe study revealed several effects of the implementation of the mandatory educational program supplemented with the SOP. Notably, there was a marked increase in the utilization of RCM during general anaesthesia. Additionally, there was a significant increase in mean PEEP levels and, importantly, a considerable improvement in adherence to the entire LPV bundle recommendations. IOLPV recommendations such as driving pressure, tidal volume, and plateau pressure were already being met prior to the intervention and remained unchanged. Overall, the educational programme enhanced by the SOP successfully increased adherence to IOLPV recommendations during general anaesthesia among anaesthesiologists in our study.\n\nAccording to current literature adherence to the IOLPV strategy significantly reduces the occurrence of ventilator-induced lung injury and postoperative pulmonary complications [ 6 , 15 , 24 , 34 , 36 – 38 ]. Paradoxically, to the best of our knowledge, there are scarce data on the level of adherence to the whole bundle IOLPV strategy in noncritical ill patients among anaesthesiologists.\n\nA clinical study published by Ladha in 2018 documented a probability of 54% for a patient to receive IOLPV during general anaesthesia [ 38 ]. However, the definition of IOLPV in Ladha’s study differed greatly from the definition used in our study. Ladha considered only tidal volume, mean PEEP and maximum plateau pressure. In our study, the definition of IOLPV also includes RCM usage and the end tidal carbon dioxide level. Moreover, even the criteria for the mean PEEP and tidal volume in our study differ from those in Ladha’s study. In our study, the criteria are in accordance with international expert panel-based consensus recommendations and were stricter than those of Ladha [ 6 , 34 ]. Therefore, we cannot compare the results of our study with those of Ladha. Another study published by Chaiwat revealed that adherence to the entire IOLPV bundle intraoperatively was as low as 53% in critically ill patients with preexisting acute lung injury or acute respiratory distress syndrome [ 16 ]. We cannot extrapolate these data either, as the study population in both studies differed. In our study, we documented the use of IOLPV in noncritically ill patients. Notably, the results of the Chaiwats study were significantly influenced with the use of the LPV strategy preoperatively [ 15 ]. Another study published by Bloos reported that IOLPV adherence was as low as 15%, but the study was performed in very different environments than general anaesthesia [ 39 ]. Lastly all mentioned studies used questionaries for gathering data and only initial ventilator setting was recorded. Our study is the first one uses automatically data recording with direct recording from ventilator to cloud based data storage and throughout the whole case.\n\nThere are several published clinical studies regarding the effect of educational programs on adherence to the IOLPV strategy intraoperatively. One of the most recent published studies documented the effect of IOLPV training on certified anaesthesia nurses [ 17 ]. This study by Wilson reported an increase in the level of adherence to IOLPV intraoperatively of 2.4% following an educational programme. Anaesthesia was given by certified anaesthesia nurses only to patients who underwent robotic surgery. The generalization of Wilson’s findings is therefore limited by the study population and specific patient conditions. In our study we enrolled patients who underwent general anaesthesia. Procedures with capnoperitoneum and without were equally represented in both groups in our study. Even though, the Wilsons results are in concordance with our findings.\n\nAnother study that documented the impact of education on increasing adherence to IOLPV intraoperatively was published by Kim [ 16 ]. This was a retrospective study, and the results are based on the questionnaire method. Moreover, ventilation parameters were recorded only once after general anaesthesia induction, and the use of RCM was not recorded. In our study, we emphasize RCM usage, as 90% of patients who undergo general anaesthesia develop atelectasis during induction [ 7 ]. The presence of atelectasis increases the risk of developing postoperative pulmonary complications. In our study, we documented that following educational programs and SOP implementation, the use of RCM increased significantly from 14% to 43%.\n\nIn accordance with the findings of Kim and Wilson, the adherence to the entire IOLPV recommendation bundle in our study increased following the educational program and SOP implementation. In our study, the increase was more than 19%. Compared to Wilson, who reported an increase of only 2.4%, the difference could be due to another study population, as Wilson included only patients who underwent robotic surgery, and anaesthesia care was delivered by CRNAs. These findings align with a study by Bloos and Wolthuis, which demonstrated that staff training can increase adherence to LPV recommendations in intensive care units [ 37 , 39 ].\n\nIn our study we chose the structure of the educational programme to be more theoretical and less practical because we believed that there is mainly knowledge gap. The practical unit in the educational program was focused on RCM usage. This unit was practical to bolster technical skills regarding initiation and usage of automatically delivered RCM. Unfortunately to our best knowledge there are no data on preference and the type of the educational programme that can be used to improve adherence to IOLPV. We can conclude that our developed programme did not burden the department workflow because the units were half hour long and were thought during morning department sessions. Ideal type of educational programme should the matter of future research.\n\nWe recognize several limitations of the study. First, we did not assess how long the effect of the intervention lasted. We admit that the effect of the intervention could last shorter than that in Wolthuis’s study [ 37 ]. Also, we did not perform analysis of specific subgroups such as cases with laparoscopy where adherence in Group B can be higher than in cases without capnoperitoneum. For post hoc analysis we do not possess enough data sets to prevent statistical errors type I and II. Finally, we recognize as a limitation that we did not monitor clinical outcomes as Wilson did in the mentioned study. However, that was not the main research question in our study because this topic was addressed in several different studies.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn our study, the mandatory educational module increased the effect of introducing the SOP for Lung Protective Ventilation during anaesthesia. Further studies would be appropriate to evaluate the duration of the observed effect and whether the concept of enhanced implementation of SOP can also work for other medical procedures.",
