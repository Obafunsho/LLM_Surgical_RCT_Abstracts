  "abstract": "Background and Aims:: Postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) is a common and distressing complication in all types of surgeries involving general anaesthesia. To establish evidence for best clinical practices, this meta-analysis compares the efficacy and safety of palonosetron and ondansetron in preventing PONV in patients undergoing non-laparoscopic surgeries.\n\nMethods:: A PRISMA-guided systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted in PubMed, Google Scholar, Semantic Scholar, and Cochrane Library to identify comparative studies that reported the efficacy (nausea and vomiting) at postoperative time points, namely T1 (0–2 hours), T2 (0–6 hours), T3 (12–24 hours), T4 (24–48 hours), and T5 (24–72 hours), as well as safety (number of incidence of adverse effects). A meta-analysis of the efficacy and safety groups was performed using a random-effects model.\n\nResults:: Nineteen randomised controlled trials were included. Pooled risk ratio (RR) revealed that patients receiving palonosetron were significantly less likely to develop nausea [0–2 h, RR = 0.82 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.50, 1.34), P = 0.317, I 2 = 15.3%], [0–6 h, RR = 0.76 (95% CI: 0.44, 1.29), P = 0.137, I 2 = 45.7%], [12–24 h, RR = 0.39 (95%CI: 0.16, 0.96), P = 0.088, I 2 = 54.2%], [24–48 h, RR = 0.44 (95% CI: 0.20, 0.96), P = 0.598, I 2 = 0%], [24–72 h, RR 0.22 (95% CI: 0.08, 0.57), P = 0.119, I 2 = 53.0%] and vomiting [0–2 h, RR = 0.59 (95% CI: 0.29, 1.23), P = 0.868, I 2 = 0%], [0–6 h, RR = 1.42 (95% CI: 0.74, 2.72), P = 0.790, I 2 = 0%], [12–24 h, RR = 0.14 (95% CI: 0.04, 0.51), P = 0.749, I 2 = 0.0%], [24–48 h, RR = 0.24 (95%CI: 0.09, 0.62), P = 0.561, I 2 = 0%], [24–72 h, RR = 0.11 (95% CI: 0.02, 0.58), P = 0.859, I 2 = 0%]. The safety profiles of palonosetron and ondansetron were comparable [headache: RR = 0.82 (95%CI: 0.65, 1.04), P = 0.940, I 2 = 0%], [drowsiness: RR = 0.96 (95%CI: 0.54, 1.71), P = 0.870, I 2 = 0%], [constipation: RR=1.20 (95%CI: 0.52, 2.79), P = 0.650, I 2 = 0%], [dizziness: RR = 0.60 (95%CI: 0.44, 0.83), P = 0.644, I 2 = 0%].\n\nConclusion:: Palonosetron and ondansetron exhibited comparable efficacy in the early hours (0–6 h). Palonosetron showed superior efficacy beyond 6 hours, providing sustained PONV prophylaxis in patients undergoing various surgeries, excluding laparoscopic procedures.",

  "full_text": "INTRODUCTION\n\nPostoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) prevalence ranges between 20% and 40% in adults, reaching as high as 79% in patients with multiple risk factors.[ 1 2 3 ] In addition, PONV poses complications such as pulmonary aspiration and wound-related problems, underscoring the importance of effective prophylaxis.[ 4 5 ]\n\n5-hydroxytryptamine-3 receptor antagonists (5-HT3RAs) are a preferred class of antiemetics for PONV prophylaxis.[ 6 ] Despite the efficacy of first-generation 5-HT3RAs in mitigating PONV, a substantial proportion of patients still endure its distressing effects. Ondansetron is most commonly used. Palonosetron, a 5-HT3RA, has superior receptor binding affinity, prolonged plasma half-life, and allosteric binding, and is used to prevent chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting.[ 7 8 9 10 11 ]\n\nIn 2015, Xiong C et al .[ 12 ] conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis comprising nine studies to evaluate the efficacy and safety of palonosetron and ondansetron for preventing PONV under general anaesthesia. The meta-analysis reported that palonosetron was more efficacious than ondansetron in preventing early postoperative nausea (PON), late PON, and late postoperative vomiting (POV). They also reported that various other patient-related and perioperative factors may influence the incidence of PONV. This review had limitations and gaps in concluding the best antiemetic drug, including high-PONV-risk surgery (laparoscopic surgery) studies with low-PONV-risk surgery, limited risk factors, and the overall small number of included trials. With additional randomised controlled trials (RCTs) after the earlier meta-analysis,[ 12 ] it was necessary to re-evaluate the existing evidence in light of these studies. The present systematic review aims to compare the efficacy and safety of palonosetron and ondansetron in preventing PONV, specifically in patients undergoing various non-laparoscopic surgeries.\n\nMETHODS\n\nThe present review was reported according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines.[ 13 ] It was prospectively registered with the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO) (ID: CRD42023426785). The comprehensive search was conducted using PubMed, Google Scholar, Semantic Scholar, and the Cochrane Library. Our study focused on patients undergoing various surgical procedures under general anaesthesia, except laparoscopic surgeries, with the aim to evaluate the efficacy and safety of intravenous palonosetron compared to intravenous ondansetron for the prophylaxis of PONV.\n\nThe PICOST criteria were defined as follows: Population (P): patients undergoing surgery under general anaesthesia; Intervention (I): administration of intravenous palonosetron for PONV prophylaxis; Comparator (C): intravenous ondansetron; Outcome (O): assessment of efficacy and safety of both palonosetron and ondansetron; Study design (S): randomised controlled trials; and Time frame (T): spanned from January 2008 to April 2024.\n\nWe included studies published in English that were conducted in patients undergoing non-laparoscopic surgeries and compared the efficacy and safety of ondansetron and palonosetron as single-agent antiemetic therapy. In instances where multiple articles were reported on the same study population, the most recent publication or study with the larger sample size was included. Exclusion criteria included studies that used combination therapy with medications such as dexamethasone, in vitro and animal studies, letters to the editor, reviews, book chapters, and studies lacking sufficient data to mitigate potential publication bias.\n\nSearch strategy\n\nThe search strategy encompassed exploring pertinent literature using the combined terms ‘Palonosetron AND Ondansetron’ [ Supplementary Table 1 ]. Following this initial search, two reviewers (JK and RA) manually eliminated duplicate entries and examined the reference lists of the articles included for further possible additions to our review.\n\nData abstraction\n\nTwo independent reviewers (JK and BL) meticulously assessed all included studies, initially screening them based on title and abstract, followed by a detailed analysis of the shortlisted articles. Any discrepancies were resolved through consensus between the reviewers. Data extraction was conducted using a standardised form, capturing key variables, including first author name, publication year, total patient count, demographic details such as age and gender distribution, drug dosage, the timing of administration, surgical and anaesthesia duration, occurrences of nausea and vomiting, and adverse effects. The kappa statistic was calculated to assess inter-rater reliability.\n\nThe incidence of nausea and vomiting measures the primary outcome efficacy of both palonosetron and ondansetron. This assessment was based on postoperative outcomes observed at five distinct time intervals: T1 (0–2 hours), T2 (0–6 hours), T3 (12–24 hours), T4 (24–48 hours), and T5 (24–72 hours). Additionally, the palonosetron and ondansetron safety profiles, as indicated by the incidence of all adverse effects, mainly headache, constipation, dizziness, and drowsiness, served as secondary outcome measures. This structured approach ensured comprehensive data collection and enabled a thorough examination of the comparative effectiveness and safety of the two medications.\n\nRisk of bias and GRADE assessment\n\nRoB-2.0 was used to analyse the risk of bias within the included studies.[ 14 ] Two independent reviewers (JK and RA) assessed the risk of bias, and any inconsistency was resolved by discussion. Robvis’ tool generated traffic light plots to visually display the risk of bias.[ 15 ]\n\nThe Grading of the Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations (GRADE) GRADEpro GDT, developed by McMaster University, was used to analyse the certainty of the evidence for each meta-analytic outcome.[ 16 ]\n\nStatistical analysis – Meta-analysis\n\nThe summary metric used in the meta-analysis was relative risk (RR) with a 95% confidence interval (CI) for dichotomous data. The trial results were aggregated using the random-effects model (DerSimonian and Laird approach). A continuity correction was made when there were no events; this was done by adding a little constant (usually 0.5) to each cell in the contingency tables. Using the Q-statistic and Moran’s I 2 , heterogeneity was evaluated and classified as low (25%–50%), moderate (50%–75%), or high (75%–100%). Forest plots were then used to summarise and depict these data visually.\n\nWe evaluated small-study effects, including publication bias, using a funnel plot. To look for potential publication bias, we also used the ‘metabias’ command to assess each funnel plot using Egger’s asymmetry test. With the aid of the ‘metan’ package, STATA version 16 (StataCorp. 2019. Stata Statistical Software: Release 16. College Station, TX: StataCorp LLC) was used to conduct the statistical analyses. A two-tailed P value was used for all data, and a P value of 0.05 level of statistical significance was used.\n\nRESULTS\n\nStudy results\n\nThe process of study identification is summarised in the PRISMA chart [ Figure 1 ]. We shortlisted 106 articles for full-text reading. Of these, 19 articles were included in the systematic review. The kappa statistic for the literature selection was 0.70, indicating substantial agreement between the reviewers. For data extraction, the kappa statistic was 0.83, indicating excellent agreement.\n\nStudy characteristics\n\nAll the included studies were published between 2012 and 2024. The total number of participants in the palonosetron group was 842 (233 men, 529 women, and 80 unspecified). The ondansetron group had 839 participants (236 men, 523 women, and 80 unspecified). Table 1 reveals the characteristics of the included studies and the heterogeneity in terms of the type of surgery: ear, nose, throat (ENT) surgeries (n = 6)[ 17 18 19 20 21 22 ] and other than ENT surgeries (n = 13);[ 23 24 25 ] general anaesthesia agents (isoflurane, n = 7;[ 17 19 20 24 25 28 35 ] sevoflurane, n = 7);[ 18 21 23 30 31 32 33 ] dose and timing of antiemetic administration (before intubation: 0.075 mg palonosetron versus (vs) 4 mg ondansetron, n = 7;[ 17 18 20 28 29 30 35 ] before intubation: 0.075 mg palonosetron vs 8 mg ondansetron, n = 4;[ 19 24 27 31 ] before extubation: 0.075 mg palonosetron vs 4 mg ondansetron, n = 2;[ 32 34 ] and before extubation: 0.075 mg palonosetron vs 8 mg ondansetron, n = 4);[ 22 23 25 33 ] and rescue drugs such as metoclopramide (n = 13),[ 19 20 22 23 25 26 27 28 30 31 33 34 35 ] ondansetron (n = 4),[ 17 18 25 29 ] and dexamethasone (n = 2).[ 29 32 ] The detailed incidence of PONV and adverse effects in the included studies is presented in Supplementary Tables 2 and 3 .\n\nThe most common side effects reported in the studies were headache, dizziness, drowsiness, and constipation. However, some other side effects, such as diarrhoea, abdominal discomfort, rash, itching, cough, allergic reactions, dyspepsia, fatigue, insomnia, and QTC prolongation, were also reported in both groups.\n\nMeta-analysis\n\nSix of the 19 studies did not report PONV outcomes in the pre-identified time-frames.[ 17 22 25 27 32 35 ] We included the remaining 13 studies for efficacy assessment. Four of these 19 studies did not report any adverse effects.[ 21 26 34 35 ] Therefore, we included the remaining 15 studies for safety assessment.\n\nEfficacy assessment\n\nNausea\n\nThe overall pooled RR for nausea indicated that palonosetron had a significantly less likely chance of developing nausea. As compared to ondansetron, this reduction was seen at all time points [18% at 0–2 h (n = 5), RR = 0.82 (95%CI: 0.50, 1.34), P = 0.317, I 2 = 15.3%], [24% at 0–6 h (n = 4), RR = 0.76 (95% CI: 0.44, 1.29), P = 0.137, I 2 = 45.7%], [61% at 12–24 h (n = 4), RR = 0.39 (95%CI: 0.16, 0.96), P = 0.088, I 2 = 54.2%], [56% at 24–48 h (n = 3), RR = 0.44 (95%CI: 0.20, 0.96), P = 0.598, I 2 = 0.0%], and [78% at 24–72 h (n = 3), RR = 0.22 (95%CI: 0.08, 0.57), P = 0.119, I 2 = 53.0%], of which the latter three points were found to be statistically significant The effect of heterogeneity was low at 0–2 h, 0–6 h, and 24–48 h and moderate at 12–24 h and 24–72 h [ Figure 2 a].\n\nVomiting\n\nThe overall pooled RR for vomiting indicated that palonosetron had significantly less likely chances of developing vomiting at all time points [41% at 0–2 h (n = 5), RR = 0.59 (95%CI: 0.29, 1.23), P = 0.868, I 2 = 0%], [86% at 12–24 h (n = 3), RR = 0.14 (95%CI: 0.04, 0.51), P = 0.749, I 2 = 0%], [76% at 24–48 h (n = 3), RR =0.24 (95%CI: 0.09, 0.62), P = 0.561, I 2 = 0%], and [89% at 24–72 h (n = 2), RR =0.11 (95%CI: 0.02, 0.58), P = 0.859, I 2 = 0%], of which expect 0–2 h, all others were found to be statistically significant. Patients receiving palonosetron [58% (n = 3), RR =1.42 (95%CI: 0.74, 2.72), P = 0.790, I 2 = 0%] were more likely to develop vomiting at 0–6 hours than those receiving ondansetron; however, it was statistically not significant. The effect of heterogeneity was low for all time points [ Figure 2 b].\n\nSafety assessment\n\nFifteen studies reported the incidence of the most common side effects, such as headache, dizziness, drowsiness, and constipation. Pooled analysis to differentiate patterns in the most prevalent adverse effects revealed that headache [18%, RR =0.82 (95%CI: 0.65, 1.04), P = 0.940, I 2 = 0%], drowsiness [4%, RR =0.96 (95%CI: 0.54, 1.71), P = 0.870, I 2 = 0%], and dizziness [40%, RR = 0.60 (95%CI: 0.44, 0.83), P = 0.644, I 2 = 0%] were comparatively less, while constipation [20%, RR = 1.20 (95%CI: 0.52, 2.79), P = 0.650, I 2 = 0%] was relatively high in the palonosetron group [ Figure 3 ].\n\nSensitivity analysis was not feasible as excluding studies with a high risk of bias resulted in few studies being included in the meta-analysis. In addition, the heterogeneity of the included studies in each time frame was low and moderate.\n\nPublication bias\n\nA funnel plot was made for safety parameters. As for efficacy, there were not more than 10 studies for any of the time points, and as a rule of thumb, publication bias was not assessed for efficacy. Funnel plots showed symmetry for safety in both headache and dizziness, according to Egger’s test ( P = 0.73 and 0.58, respectively), supporting that no publication bias was seen for safety.\n\nRisk of bias and grade assessment\n\nOut of 19 included studies, 11 revealed a low risk of bias, and the remaining eight exhibited high risk or some concerns [ Figure 4 ]. The quality of evidence in the present study was found to be high, while studies were modest in sample size (30–99 participants per group). The certainty of evidence and its importance were high and critical during the early hours (0–2 hours), moderate and important in the 6–24-hour range, and low yet critical after 24 hours. This indicates a need for further studies to validate the findings regarding palonosetron outperforming ondansetron in the later hours. In the case of headache and dizziness, the certainty of evidence was high, and the importance was critical. However, while the certainty of evidence was high, its importance was insignificant for drowsiness and constipation, indicating that the findings do not significantly influence clinical practice [ Figure 5 ].\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nOur systematic review and meta-analysis revealed pooled reduction in PON ranging from 18% to 78%, and POV ranging from 41% to 89%. Meta-analysis indicated that palonosetron exhibited comparable efficacy in the early hours (0–6 hours) and significantly lower chances of PONV at various time frames beyond 6 hours, highlighting its advantage in sustained PONV prophylaxis. The safety profiles of both drugs were similar, with headache, dizziness, drowsiness, and constipation being the most commonly reported side effects.\n\nPONV is a prevalent complication following surgeries performed under general anaesthesia. The multifactorial nature of PONV, influenced by anaesthetic agents, surgical techniques, and individual patient characteristics, necessitates effective management strategies. Ondansetron has been a standard treatment for many years among the various antiemetics available. Despite extensive research on the prevention and management of PONV, debates continue over the optimal use of newer-generation antiemetics. Palonosetron, a newer-generation 5-HT3 receptor antagonist, has shown promise due to its prolonged half-life and potentially superior efficacy.[ 36 ]\n\nThe pooled data from the included studies revealed that the pooled reduction of PON was 18%–78%, steadily increasing over time. The lack of significant reduction in nausea with palonosetron during the early hours of the present meta-analysis can be attributed to the findings of Moon et al .[ 23 ] and Shadangi et al .,[ 24 ] which favoured ondansetron. However, the differences were not statistically significant. Similarly, during the 0–6-hour period, nausea reduction with palonosetron was not significant, while significant reductions were observed in later postoperative phases, specifically at 12–24 hours, 24–48 hours, and 24–72 hours. Few studies report that palonosetron administered before tracheal intubation was notably more effective, suggesting that its optimal effectiveness requires preoperative administration.[ 18 19 24 28 29 30 31 ] These findings indicate a need to reconsider the timing of palonosetron administration to enhance its effectiveness in the initial hours post-surgery.\n\nRegarding vomiting, the pooled RR revealed that the palonosetron group had a lower chance of developing vomiting, ranging from 41% to 89%. In the initial 2 hours, the instances of vomiting in the palonosetron group were less but insignificant. Conversely, the meta-analysis of three studies indicated that patients receiving palonosetron were 58% (n = 8) more likely to develop vomiting in the 0–6-hour time frame than those receiving ondansetron. This finding can be attributed to the studies by Yoo et al .[ 33 ] and Arya et al .[ 28 ]\n\nYoo et al .[ 33 ] compared a 0.075 mg bolus of palonosetron administered intravenously 30 minutes before the end of surgery alongside an 8 mL saline addition to the IV-patient-controlled analgesia (PCA). In contrast, ondansetron was given as an 8 mg bolus intravenously 30 minutes prior to the end of surgery, with a total of 16 mg added to the IV-PCA. The equipotency of these dosages is questionable, particularly given the higher dosage in the ondansetron group, which may explain the differences observed. Arya et al .[ 28 ] reported that although the ondansetron group had fewer instances of vomiting, the difference between the two groups was not statistically significant.\n\nIn the late postoperative phases, the chances of both nausea and vomiting were significantly less in the palonosetron group. This is attributed to its longer plasma half-life and higher affinity for 5-HT3 receptors. The requirement for rescue antiemetic was less in the palonosetron group, underscoring its potential for better PONV control. Despite these advantages, the included studies showed significant variations in dosing, the timing of administration, anaesthesia drugs and types of surgeries, underscoring the complex nature of PONV and the numerous factors that influence its incidence. The reported timing of nausea and vomiting incidences varied widely among the included studies. Consequently, conducting a subgroup analysis based on different types of surgeries was not feasible.\n\nA pooled meta-analysis of overall side effects could not be conducted because the included studies did not provide the number of patients experiencing any side effects in each group and only reported the frequency of individual side effects such as headache, dizziness, drowsiness, and constipation. This lack of patient-specific data means that individual sensitivities to the same dose cannot be accounted for, as some patients may experience more side effects than others. Specifically, headache incidence was significantly less in patients receiving palonosetron. This might be attributed to weak 5-HT1 antagonistic action. Dizziness was significantly less common with palonosetron.[ 19 23 24 26 30 31 33 35 ] Conversely, constipation was relatively higher in the palonosetron group, although this difference was not statistically significant. The increased incidence of constipation with palonosetron may be linked to its greater affinity for the 5-HT3A receptor, which prolongs gut transit time and suppresses postprandial colonic motor function.[ 37 ] These findings suggest that palonosetron may offer a favourable side effect profile in managing PONV. However, attention should be given to the potential for increased constipation. Vishwasrao et al .[ 27 ] reported QTc prolongation in one patient in the ondansetron group. This warns of the need to document baseline QT intervals and monitor for their prolongation, especially in patients receiving ondansetron. However, the palonosetron is safe in this regard.[ 38 ]\n\nPONV is a multifactorial condition, making it difficult to determine the safest and most effective antiemetic drugs. Although numerous RCTs and published meta-analyses have addressed these issues, they often have limitations, particularly in standardising key parameters.[ 12 39 40 41 42 43 ] The current study also faces several challenges, including variability in reported data, inconsistent PONV assessment timings, lack of detailed information on anaesthetic techniques, and inadequate consideration of patient baseline risks. Based on an extensive literature review, we recommend a list of specific preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative parameters for future high-quality studies [ Table 2 ]. These studies should be designed with large sample sizes and adopt a multicentre approach to thoroughly evaluate the safety and efficacy of commonly used antiemetic drugs on the market. This approach will also facilitate the identification of novel antiemetic agents that may be superior to current medications. Additionally, evaluating cost-effectiveness and prioritising the inclusion of novel antiemetic agents will help improve clinical outcomes and guide better decision-making in PONV management. Despite its effectiveness, palonosetron did not fully eliminate PONV, highlighting the need for further investigation into more potent antiemetics or combination therapies tailored to specific patient populations.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nBased on our meta-analysis, palonosetron and ondansetron exhibited comparable efficacy in the early hours, supported by high-certainty evidence. Palonosetron showed superior efficacy, demonstrating significantly lower chances of PONV and revealing sustained PONV prophylaxis beyond 6 hours compared to ondansetron in patients undergoing various surgeries, excluding laparoscopic procedures. However, the evidence for this finding is of low certainty, and further research is needed to validate it. The safety profiles of both drugs are similar and supported by high-certainty evidence. Further multicentre, randomised trials comparing equipotent doses can strengthen the available evidence.\n\nData availability\n\nThe data for this systematic review and/or meta-analysis may be requested with reasonable justification from the authors (email to the corresponding author) and shall be shared upon request.\n\nConflicts of interest\n\nThere are no conflicts of interest.",
