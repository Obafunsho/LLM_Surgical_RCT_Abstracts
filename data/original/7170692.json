  "title": "Does An Augmented Reality-based Portable Navigation System Improve the Accuracy of Acetabular Component Orientation During THA? A Randomized Controlled Trial",
  "abstract": "Background: We developed an augmented reality (AR)-based portable navigation system in which the surgeon can view the pelvic plane and placement angle of an acetabular cup on the display of a smartphone during THA.\n\nQuestions/purposes: (1) Is acetabular component placement more accurate using the AR-based portable navigation system compared with the conventional freehand technique? (2) Is intraoperative measurement of placement angle more accurate when using the AR-based portable navigation system compared with a goniometer?\n\nMethods: Forty-six patients were randomly assigned to undergo acetabular cup placement during THA using the AR-based portable navigation system (AR navigation group) or placement of a mechanical alignment guide (conventional group). All surgeries were performed with the patient in the lateral decubitus position. We compared the absolute value of the difference between the targeted placement angle and postoperative measured placement angle between the groups using two types of imaging (radiography and CT).\n\nResults: In terms of radiographic inclination, the mean differences between the targeted placement angle and postoperative measured angle were smaller in the AR navigation group than in the conventional group for both radiographs and CT images (2.3° ± 1.4° versus 3.9° ± 2.4°, respectively; p = 0.009 and 1.9° ± 1.3° versus 3.4° ± 2.6°, respectively; p = 0.02). There were no differences in radiographic anteversion between the two groups. No complications were associated with the use of the AR-based portable navigation system.\n\nConclusions: This system yielded no differences in acetabular anteversion accuracy, and no clinically important differences in acetabular inclination. Therefore, at this time we cannot recommend this device as its costs and risks cannot be justified based on the absence of a clinically meaningful difference in cup placement accuracy. Although we detected no complications, this was a small series, and this approach adds both surgical time and pins in the ilium.\n\nLevel of Evidence: Level I, therapeutic study.",
