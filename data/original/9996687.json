  "title": "The Impact of Perioperative Stroke and Delirium on Outcomes after Surgical Aortic Valve Replacement",
  "abstract": "Objectives:: The effects of stroke and delirium on post-discharge cognition and patient-centered health outcomes after surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) are not well characterized. Here we assess the impact of post-operative stroke and delirium on these health outcomes in SAVR patients at 90 days.\n\nMethods:: Patients (N=383) undergoing SAVR (41% received concomitant CABG) enrolled in a randomized trial of embolic protection devices underwent serial neurological and delirium evaluations at post-operative days 1, 3, and 7, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at day 7. Outcomes included 90-day functional status, neurocognitive decline from pre-surgical baseline, and quality of life (QoL).\n\nResults:: By post-operative day 7, 25 (6.6%) patients experienced clinical stroke and 103 (28.5%) manifested delirium. During index hospitalization, time to discharge was longer in patients experiencing stroke (HR 0.62;95% CI 0.42–0.94;p=0.02) and patients experiencing delirium (HR 0.68;95% CI 0.54–0.86;p=0.001). At day 90, stroke patients were more likely to have a modified Rankin score >2 (OR 5.9;95% CI 1.7–20.1;p=0.01), depression (OR 5.3;95% CI 1.6–17.3;p=0.006), a lower 12-Item Short Form Survey (SF-12) physical health score (adjusted mean difference −3.3±1.9;p=0.08) and neurocognitive decline (OR 7.8;95% CI 2.3–26.4;p=0.001). Delirium was associated with depression (OR 2.2;95% CI 0.9–5.3;p=0.08), lower SF-12 physical health (adjusted mean difference −2.3±1.1;p=0.03), and neurocognitive decline (OR 2.2;95% CI 1.2–4.0;p=0.01).\n\nConclusions:: Stroke and delirium occur more frequently after SAVR than is commonly recognized and these events are associated with disability, depression, cognitive decline, and poorer QoL at 90 days post-operatively. These findings support the need for new interventions to reduce these events and improve patient-centered outcomes.",
