  "abstract": "Background: Total gastrectomy (TG) is the predominant approach for proximal gastric cancer; however, it frequently leads to various postoperative nutritional and metabolic disorders. Recently, double‐tract reconstruction (DTR) following proximal gastrectomy (PG) has been developed to preserve gastric function and reduce postoperative reflux esophagitis. This study aimed to compare the outcomes of PG‐DTR with those of TG in patients with proximal gastric cancer.\n\nMethods: Patients with clinically staged cT1 to cT2 proximal gastric cancer who underwent either PG‐DTR or TG with Roux‐en‐Y reconstruction (TG‐RY) were enrolled. Propensity score matching (PSM) was applied to reduce confounding bias. Surgical outcomes, nutritional status, reflux esophagitis, and prognosis were prospectively analyzed. Quality of life (QOL) was assessed at 3, 6, and 12 months postoperatively using the Postgastrectomy Syndrome Assessment Scale‐45 (PGSAS‐45).\n\nResults: After PSM, 93 patients were included in each group (PG‐DTR and TG‐RY). The PG‐DTR group had fewer retrieved lymph nodes than the TG‐RY group. No significant differences were observed between the groups in operative time, blood loss, postoperative complications, length of hospital stay, reflux esophagitis, overall survival (OS), or disease‐free survival (DFS). Female sex, preoperative BMI, TG‐RY procedure, and severe postoperative complications (POCs) were identified as independent risk factors for malnutrition at 3 months postgastrectomy. Postoperatively, the TG‐RY group exhibited significantly lower levels of hemoglobin, total protein, and albumin than the PG‐DTR group. No differences were observed in postoperative QOL between the two groups, except for greater weight loss in the TG‐RY group.\n\nConclusions: Compared to TG‐RY, PG‐DTR was associated with improved postoperative nutritional status, including better body weight, hemoglobin, and albumin levels, in patients with early‐stage proximal gastric cancer. Additionally, PG‐DTR demonstrated comparable short‐term outcomes, prognosis, and postoperative QOL to TG‐RY, further supporting its viability as a surgical option.",

  "full_text": "Introduction\n\nGastric cancer was the fifth most commonly diagnosed cancer and the fourth leading cause of cancer‐related mortality worldwide in 2020 [ 1 ]. In recent years, the incidence of tumors in the upper stomach, particularly adenocarcinomas of the esophagogastric junction (EGJ; predominantly Siewert type II and III tumors), has been steadily rising, likely due to factors such as the increasing prevalence of gastroesophageal reflux disease, changes in Helicobacter pylori infection rates, and environmental influences, including the rising rates of obesity [ 2 , 3 ]. The incidence of early gastric cancer has also increased, primarily due to advancements in diagnostic technologies, improved screening methods, and greater public awareness [ 4 , 5 ].\n\nTotal gastrectomy (TG) is the conventional surgical option for proximal gastric cancer, which enables comprehensive lymph node dissection and helps prevent severe reflux esophagitis. However, TG is linked to significant long‐term nutritional and metabolic complications, as well as reduced quality of life (QOL) [ 6 , 7 ], which pose particular challenges for early gastric cancer patients with favorable prognoses and longer survival.\n\nAccording to the 2018 Japanese gastric cancer treatment guidelines, proximal gastrectomy (PG) is recommended for early upper gastric cancer if an R0 resection can preserve more than half of the distal stomach [ 8 ]. PG aims to preserve partial gastric function but disrupts the anti‐reflux mechanism of the cardia while retaining the pylorus, which may delay gastric emptying. Consequently, PG is associated with complications such as severe reflux esophagitis and anastomotic strictures [ 9 ]. To mitigate these issues, various reconstruction techniques—including esophagogastrostomy, jejunal pouch interposition, jejunal interposition, and double‐tract reconstruction (DTR)—have been developed. Each reconstruction method has unique advantages and limitations; however, high‐quality evidence remains scarce, and no consensus on the optimal reconstruction technique has been established [ 10 ]. PG‐DTR provides a dual route for food passage through the residual stomach and jejunum, demonstrating effective anti‐reflux properties and gaining clinical popularity [ 11 , 12 ]. While PG‐DTR has shown short‐term feasibility and safety, data on its mid‐term nutritional outcomes and QOL remain inconsistent [ 13 , 14 , 15 , 16 ]. Thus, we conducted a comparative analysis of PG‐DTR and TG in patients with early‐stage proximal gastric cancer to provide further insight into their respective outcomes.\n\nMethod\n\nPatients\n\nPatients with proximal gastric cancer were prospectively enrolled in this observational study from February 2021 to March 2023. The inclusion criteria were: (1) Histologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the stomach; (2) Underwent PG‐DTR or TG with Roux‐en‐Y reconstruction (TG‐RY); (3) Tumor located in the upper third of the stomach, with a clinical stage of cT1 to cT2; (4) No severe comorbidities. The exclusion criteria were: (1) Siewert type I adenocarcinoma of the EGJ; (2) Presence of distant metastasis; (3) Tumor size > 4 cm; (4) Postoperative fluoroscopy showing contrast passage solely through the remnant stomach or only through the jejunum in the PG‐DTR group (as shown in Figure 1 ); (5) Incomplete clinicopathological data.\n\nDefinitions and Clinical Outcomes\n\nFluoroscopy is routinely performed on postoperative Day 5 for PG‐DTR patients. Follow‐up was conducted every 3 months in the first postoperative year and every 6 months in the subsequent second and third years, with the last follow‐up in April 2024. Disease‐free survival (DFS) was defined as the interval from surgery to the first occurrence of disease recurrence, last follow‐up, or death from any cause. Overall survival (OS) refers to the time from surgery to either death from any cause or the last follow‐up.\n\nRoutine endoscopy was performed approximately 1 year postoperatively to assess the severity of reflux esophagitis using the Los Angeles Classification System [ 17 ]. Pathological staging was conducted following the AJCC 8th edition staging system for gastric cancer [ 18 ].\n\nSurgical outcomes assessed included blood loss, operative time, resected lymph nodes, radical resection status, postoperative complications (POCs), time to first flatus, time to first soft diet, and postoperative stay. POCs were classified according to the Clavien–Dindo grading system, with grades III to V defined as severe POCs [ 19 ]. Nutritional indicators measured were hemoglobin, total protein, albumin, and body mass index (BMI). Bowel function recovery was evaluated by the time to first flatus and the initiation of a soft diet [ 20 ].\n\nQOL was assessed using the Postgastrectomy Syndrome Assessment Scale‐45 (PGSAS‐45), a multidimensional tool comprising 45 items. It includes 23 items grouped into seven symptom subscales: esophageal reflux, abdominal pain, meal‐related distress, indigestion, diarrhea, constipation, and dumping. Additionally, 22 items evaluate aspects such as decrease in body weight, ingested amount of food per meal, necessity for additional meals, quality of ingestion, ability for work, dissatisfaction with symptoms, meals, working, daily life, and both physical and mental component summaries. Overall, this comprehensive scale provides a thorough assessment of QOL after gastrectomy [ 21 , 22 , 23 ].\n\nThe GLIM (Global Leadership Initiative on Malnutrition) criteria were applied to assess malnutrition at the third postoperative month. This evaluation followed a two‐step process: first, the Nutrition Risk Screening (NRS‐2002) was used to identify at‐risk patients, followed by the GLIM criteria to confirm malnutrition, requiring at least one phenotypic criterion (e.g., weight loss, low BMI, or reduced muscle mass) and one etiologic criterion (e.g., reduced food intake, inflammation, or disease burden). Since all patients underwent gastrectomy for gastric cancer, they inherently met the etiologic criterion due to disease burden and inflammation [ 24 , 25 ].\n\nDetailed Surgical Technique of PG‐DTR\n\nIn accordance with the Japanese Gastric Cancer Treatment Guidelines, a D1+ lymphadenectomy was performed, targeting lymph nodes No. 1, 2, 3a, 4sa, 4sb, 7, 8a, 9, and 11p [ 26 ]. The procedure included transection of the esophagus and resection of the tumor with the proximal stomach. The jejunum was divided approximately 20 to 25 cm distal to the ligament of Treitz. An end‐to‐side esophagojejunostomy was performed using a circular stapler, and the jejunal stump was closed with a linear stapler. A side‐to‐side jejunojejunostomy was created approximately 45 to 50 cm distal to the esophagojejunostomy between the proximal and distal jejunum. Additionally, a side‐to‐side anastomosis was performed between the jejunum and the posterior wall of the remnant stomach using a 60‐mm linear stapler, 10 to 15 cm distal to the esophagojejunostomy, followed by closure of the gastric stump (Figure 2 ).\n\nStatistical Analysis\n\nAll statistical analyses were performed using SPSS version 27.0 and R version 4.1.1. Categorical variables were analyzed using the chi‐squared test or Fisher's exact test, while continuous variables were compared with either Student's t ‐test or the Mann–Whitney U test, depending on data distribution. To reduce confounding, propensity score matching (PSM) was performed using one‐to‐one nearest neighbor matching without replacement with a caliper width of 0.02. The propensity score was estimated using a logistic regression model that included the following covariates: age, sex, preoperative BMI, hypertension, diabetes, preoperative hemoglobin, preoperative serum iron, preoperative total protein, preoperative albumin, ASA score, tumor size, type of surgery, pTNM stage, and adjuvant chemotherapy. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was then conducted to identify independent risk factors for malnutrition. Longitudinal changes between groups were analyzed using a linear mixed model (LMM), with Bonferroni correction applied to adjust for multiple comparisons. Survival analysis was conducted with the Kaplan–Meier method, and survival rates were compared using the Log‐rank test. A p ‐value of < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.\n\nResults\n\nPatient Characteristics\n\nA total of 344 patients with clinical stage cT1 to cT2 proximal gastric cancer were initially enrolled. After applying the exclusion criteria, 263 patients were eligible for analysis, comprising 98 patients in the PG‐DTR group and 165 in the TG‐RY group (Figure 3 ). Before PSM, significant differences were observed in several baseline characteristics, including preoperative BMI, hypertension status, preoperative total protein and albumin levels, and tumor differentiation ( p < 0.05). After 1:1 PSM, 93 matched patients were included in each group, resulting in a balanced cohort with no statistically significant differences in baseline characteristics, thus facilitating robust comparative analysis ( p > 0.05; Table 1 ). After matching, all 186 patients completed postoperative assessments for body mass index, blood tests, and endoscopic examinations as scheduled. QOL at 3 months post‐surgery was evaluated using the PGSAS‐45 for all patients. However, three patients in the PG‐DTR group and five patients in the TG‐RY group missed the QOL assessment at 6 months post‐surgery. At the 12‐month follow‐up, seven patients in the PG‐DTR group and eight in the TG‐RY group did not complete the QOL assessment.\n\nSurgical Outcomes\n\nThe TG‐RY group had a significantly greater total number of resected lymph nodes than the PG‐DTR group ( p < 0.05). This difference was attributed to the additional retrieval of lymph nodes at stations #4d, 5, 6, and 12a in the TG‐RY procedure—stations that are not routinely dissected in PG‐DTR according to current guidelines. However, the number of lymph nodes retrieved from stations #1 to 3, 4sa, 4sb, 7 to 9, and 11 did not differ significantly between the two groups ( p > 0.05). Importantly, none of the additionally retrieved lymph nodes (#4d, 5, 6, 12a) in the TG‐RY group were positive for metastasis. No other significant differences were observed in surgical outcomes between the two groups ( p > 0.05; Table 2 ). Additionally, as shown in Table 3 , there were no significant differences in overall postoperative complications (POCs), severe POCs, or length of hospital stay between the two groups across all subgroups ( p > 0.05).\n\nMid‐Term Outcomes\n\nAt 12 months postoperatively, no significant difference in reflux esophagitis incidence was observed between the two groups ( p > 0.05). At 3 months postoperatively, a greater proportion of patients in the TG‐RY group experienced moderate to severe malnutrition compared to the PG‐DTR group ( p < 0.05; Table 4 ). Multivariate analysis revealed that female sex, low preoperative BMI, TG‐RY reconstruction, and severe POCs were independent risk factors for malnutrition ( p < 0.05; Table 5 ).\n\nNo statistically significant differences in OS and DFS were observed between the PG‐DTR group and the TG‐RY group ( p > 0.05; Figure 4 ).\n\nThroughout this longitudinal study, hemoglobin, total protein, and serum albumin levels were higher in the PG‐DTR group compared to the TG‐RY group ( p < 0.05). Specifically, hemoglobin levels in the PG‐DTR group were significantly higher at 3, 6, and 12 months postoperatively, while total protein and serum albumin levels were higher at 3 and 12 months postoperatively ( p < 0.05; Figures S1 and S2 ).\n\nApart from the greater decrease in body weight observed in the TG‐RY group throughout the postoperative follow‐up period, the QOL scores measured by the PGSAS‐45 were comparable between the two groups ( p > 0.05; Figure S2 ).\n\nDISSUSION\n\nTo date, TG remains the preferred surgical approach for patients with early proximal gastric cancer unsuitable for endoscopic treatment [ 27 ]. With advancing understanding of lymphatic metastasis patterns and the development of anti‐reflux reconstruction techniques, PG has been increasingly adopted in clinical practice [ 28 , 29 ]. In addition to PG‐DTR, other reconstruction methods such as Kamikawa, SOFY, and tubular stomach reconstruction have been proposed to address postgastrectomy reflux and functional preservation. While Kamikawa and SOFY focus on creating anti‐reflux valves through flap or fundoplication techniques, tubular reconstruction aims to preserve gastric reservoir function by shaping a narrow gastric tube [ 30 , 31 ]. Although these techniques aim to optimize outcomes, no consensus exists on the optimal approach due to variations in technical complexity, postoperative complications, and nutritional outcomes.\n\nPG‐DTR has been established as a primary surgical approach for early‐stage proximal gastric cancer in our institution, supported by its endorsement in the 2020 Chinese Consensus on Digestive Tract Reconstruction (evidence level II C, recommendation grade B) [ 32 ] and by its dual‐pathway mechanism, which optimizes both anti‐reflux efficacy and nutrient absorption.\n\nIn this study, the majority of PG‐DTR patients underwent postoperative fluoroscopy, showing contrast agent passage through both the remnant stomach and jejunum into the distal jejunum. However, in two cases, the contrast agent passed only through the jejunum, and in one case, only through the remnant stomach. When most food bypasses the remnant stomach via the jejunal pathway, the benefits of PG may diminish, resembling those of TG [ 33 ]. A larger jejunogastrostomy anastomosis reduces resistance to food entry into the remnant stomach, allowing greater food volume [ 34 ]. In line with previous recommendations [ 35 , 36 ], this study used a 60 mm linear stapler to expand the jejunogastrostomy anastomosis.\n\nAlthough PG‐DTR involves more surgical steps and an additional anastomosis compared to TG‐RY, advancements in techniques and instrumentation prevented any increase in operation time or anastomotic leakage rates. Furthermore, the two procedures showed no significant differences in blood loss, radical resection rates, intraoperative blood transfusion, time to bowel function recovery, POCs, or mortality. These results are consistent with previous studies [ 16 , 37 , 38 ], supporting the satisfactory outcomes, feasibility, and safety of PG‐DTR.\n\nSince TG entails a more extensive lymphadenectomy that includes stations #4d, #5, #6, and #12a—stations not routinely dissected in PG per the Japanese Gastric Cancer Treatment Guidelines [ 26 ]—the TG‐RY group had more dissected lymph nodes in this study. This difference was entirely attributable to the retrieval of lymph nodes from these additional stations. Importantly, none of these additionally retrieved lymph nodes (#4d, #5, #6, and #12a) in the TG‐RY group were positive for metastasis. Oncological safety after PG depends not only on the extent of lymph node dissection but also on the metastatic risk in distal nodal basins. Our findings align with previous reports indicating a very low metastatic rate in stations #4d, #5, #6, and #12a—even zero among T2 tumors—which supports the oncological feasibility of omitting their dissection during PG [ 39 ]. A multicenter retrospective study in Japan found that for EGJ carcinoma ≤ 4 cm in diameter, distal gastric lymph node metastasis is rare, supporting the feasibility of transabdominal PG [ 40 ]. In this study, OS and DFS were comparable between the PG‐DTR and TG‐RY groups. For early‐stage gastric cancer, PG effectively ensures oncological safety by addressing necessary lymph node dissection while minimizing resection extent [ 41 , 42 , 43 ].\n\nPostoperative serum iron levels did not differ significantly between the PG‐DTR and TG‐RY groups. When serum iron or ferritin levels fall below normal, our institution routinely administers oral iron supplementation. However, hemoglobin levels were higher in the PG‐DTR group. The preservation of a portion of the stomach in PG‐DTR may permit limited production of gastric acid and intrinsic factor, potentially enhancing the absorption of iron and vitamin B12, thereby supporting hemoglobin maintenance. Additionally, the DTR approach promotes more efficient nutrient absorption, which may further contribute to improved hemoglobin levels [ 44 , 45 , 46 , 47 ].\n\nOne of the benefits of TG for proximal gastric cancer is its lower incidence of reflux esophagitis [ 48 , 49 ]. In this study, the DTR approach effectively reduced reflux symptoms to a level comparable to TG. The interposed jejunal segment between the remnant stomach and esophagus increases the distance for potential reflux while also allowing partial food passage through the jejunum, thereby alleviating food stasis in the remnant stomach [ 15 ].\n\nAlthough a small proportion of patients did not complete QOL assessments at 6 and 12 months postoperatively, the study employed a LMM, which is well‐suited for longitudinal data analysis and can accommodate missing data under the assumption that data are missing at random (MAR) [ 50 ]. This approach allowed for a robust comparison between the TG‐RY and PG‐DTR groups. QOL scores were comparable between the two groups, except for a greater decrease in body weight observed in the TG‐RY group during postoperative follow‐up. Park et al. [ 13 ] used the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) core questionnaires (QLQ‐C30) and the gastric cancer‐specific module (QLQ‐STO22) to assess postoperative QOL in PG and TG, finding similar outcomes between the groups up to 2 years after surgery. Another study found no clinically significant difference in food‐related symptoms or QOL between PG and TG [ 51 ]. However, Sato et al. [ 52 ] found that PG‐DT resulted in better QOL outcomes, particularly in diarrhea symptoms and food intake quality scores. Similarly, another study indicated that patients undergoing PG‐DT had improved QOL, with reduced reflux esophagitis and higher scores in global health and emotional functioning, along with fewer symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, and pain [ 53 ]. The variations in findings on PG‐DT's impact on QOL may stem from differences in assessment tools, as some scales emphasize gastrointestinal symptoms more than others, as well as from patient characteristics and surgical expertise across studies.\n\nNutritional indicators, including body weight, hemoglobin, albumin, and total protein, consistently remained higher in the PG‐DTR group, suggesting that DTR may improve postoperative nutritional status. Notably, total protein and albumin reached their lowest levels, and the most significant weight loss occurred at 3 months postoperatively. This period represents a critical phase in recovery, as highlighted by multiple studies emphasizing the importance of nutritional status at 3 months post‐surgery [ 54 , 55 ]. Accordingly, we used GLIM to assess malnutrition at this specific time point and identified TG‐RY as an independent risk factor for postoperative malnutrition. The preservation of part of the stomach and the open duodenal pathway in PG‐DTR promotes duodenal functionality, stimulating the secretion of cholecystokinin and secretin, which aid in food digestion and absorption. Additionally, retaining part of the stomach preserves its grinding and digestive functions, facilitating more effective bile and food transport and mixing, which supports overall nutritional maintenance [ 14 , 44 , 56 , 57 ].\n\nThis study has several limitations. First, although recent findings indicate that PG does not compromise OS in stage III gastric cancer [ 58 ], our study included only cases of stage cT1 to cT2. Second, differences in postoperative serum vitamin B12 levels between the two groups may partially explain the lower hemoglobin levels observed in the TG‐RY group [ 57 , 59 ]. Our study did not measure vitamin B12 levels or track the number of patients taking vitamin B12 supplements. Third, as a non‐randomized study, selection bias may exist despite PSM, as treatment allocation was based on clinical and anatomical criteria rather than randomization. Finally, although a small number of patients were excluded based on postoperative fluoroscopy findings (exclusive passage through either the remnant stomach or the jejunal limb), this criterion was used to ensure functional validation of the double‐tract physiology and maintain cohort homogeneity.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn summary, PG‐DTR demonstrated significant advantages over TG‐RY in enhancing postoperative nutritional status for patients with proximal gastric cancer, while maintaining comparable short‐term outcomes and mid‐term prognosis, establishing it as a viable surgical option. Further long‐term studies are warranted to more precisely define these benefits and to optimize patient outcomes.\n\nAuthor Contributions\n\nYing Liu: conceptualization (equal), data curation (equal), methodology (equal), project administration (lead), resources (lead), writing – original draft (equal).
