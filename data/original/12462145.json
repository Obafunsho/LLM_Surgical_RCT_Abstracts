  "full_text": "History of Presentation\n\nAn 80-year-old man presented to another hospital with back pain, shortness of breath, and anorexia 5 days before presenting to our institution. A ruptured internal iliac artery aneurysm (IIAA) was suspected based on the findings of plain computed tomography (CT) performed at the other hospital; therefore, he was referred to our hospital for surgical intervention. Take-Home Messages • Arteriovenous fistula formation after a ruptured aneurysm perforates the vein and can induce hemodynamic instability. • Temporary balloon occlusion of the arteriovenous fistula through the femoral vein can stabilize the hemodynamic status, enabling emergency endovascular aneurysm repair under stable conditions.\n\nPast Medical History\n\nThe patient's medical history included paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, hypertension, hyperuricemia, and benign prostatic hyperplasia. His medications consisted of a direct oral anticoagulant and an angiotensin receptor blocker. He had no preexisting renal dysfunction, and his creatinine level at a regular follow-up at the previous hospital was 1.05 mg/dL.\n\nInvestigations\n\nThe patient's height, weight, and body mass index were 170 cm, 81.0 kg, and 28.0 kg/m 2 , respectively. His vital signs were as follows: body temperature, 35.5 °C; heart rate, 113 beats/min; blood pressure, 97/53 mm Hg; and respiratory rate, 22 breaths/min. The initial laboratory test revealed the following: hemoglobin, 14.4 g/dL; white blood cell count, 10,100/μL with 81.9% neutrophils; and platelet count, 228,000/μL. The serum sodium, potassium, and C-reactive protein levels were 135 mEq/L, 5.1 mEq/L, and 1.87 mg/dL, respectively. Blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, and probrain natriuretic peptide levels were elevated at 45.2 mg/dL, 4.75 mg/dL, and 31,588 pg/mL, respectively. Electrocardiography showed a normal sinus rhythm with tachycardia, and chest radiography revealed cardiac enlargement with a cardiothoracic ratio of 61.8%. Echocardiography revealed dilation of the inferior vena cava (IVC), measuring 29.1 mm during inspiration and 27.6 mm during expiration. In contrast, the left ventricular systolic and diastolic diameters (44/24 mm) were within normal limits.\n\nContrast-enhanced CT performed at our institution revealed a ruptured right IIAA that perforated the common iliac vein and formed an arteriovenous fistula (AVF) with a dilated IVC ( Figures 1A to 1F ). The maximal diameter of the aneurysm was 60.7 mm.\n\nManagement\n\nAcute heart failure caused by an AVF formed by the rupture of IIAA into the common iliac vein was diagnosed. He had preoperative renal function deterioration caused by systemic venous hypertension, which posed a risk of dialysis initiation due to contrast agent use; however, endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) was chosen for life-saving purposes. A central venous catheter was inserted at the right internal carotid vein, and central venous pressure monitoring was initiated. Figure 2 shows the time course of the patient's vital signs during surgery. The initial central venous pressure was consistently in the range of 16 to 19 mm Hg. During general anesthesia induction, the patient experienced shock. Catecholamine administration and volume loading were required because he experienced hemodynamic instability. Surgical groin exposure was performed for vascular access to safely and accurately access the target vessels. Following opening bilateral groins and taping right common femoral artery, vein, and left common femoral artery, a 10-F introducer sheath (TERUMO) was promptly inserted through the right femoral vein (FV). The AVF site was identified using contrast venography ( Figures 3A and 3B ) and temporarily closed by dilatation of a Cook CODA balloon catheter (Cook Medicals) ( Figures 3C and 3D ), resulting in hemodynamic stability with elevated blood pressure and decreased central venous pressure ( Figure 2 ). Subsequently, an 8-F introducer sheath (TERUMO) was inserted through the right common femoral artery. In order to prevent a type Ⅱ endoleak, the right superior and inferior gluteal arteries were selectively embolized using a Penumbra POD packing coil and Ruby coil (Penumbra, Inc) ( Figures 3E and 3F ).\n\nFigure 3G shows the aortography results after coil embolization. A trunk-ipsilateral leg (28.5 mm/14.5 mm × 12 cm; Gore Excluder; W. L. Gore & Associates, Inc) was inserted through the right femoral artery and deployed at 3 cm distal to the origin of the right renal artery. A contralateral leg (27 mm × 12 cm; W. L. Gore & Associates, Inc) was inserted through the left femoral artery and deployed at the distal level just above the bifurcation of the left external iliac artery and internal iliac artery. An additional ipsilateral leg (14.5 mm × 14 cm; W. L. Gore & Associates, Inc) was inserted and deployed to cover the IIAA. After contracting the temporary balloon inserted in the FV, aortography revealed the absence of AVF flow and no endoleaks ( Figure 3H ).\n\nOutcome and Follow-Up\n\nThe patient's postoperative respiratory status and hemodynamics status remained stable without hemodialysis. Extubation was performed 1 day after surgery, and the patient was discharged from the intensive care unit 3 days after surgery. CT performed 9 days after surgery revealed the absence of arteriovenous flow and no endoleaks ( Figures 4A to 4D ). Postoperative echocardiography revealed improved right-heart dilatation. The IVC diameters were 14.2 mm during expiration and 4.2 mm during inspiration. The creatinine and pro-brain natriuretic peptide levels were 1.01 mg/dL and 425 pg/mL, respectively, at the time of discharge 30 days after surgery.\n\nDiscussion\n\nA ruptured abdominal aortic or iliac aneurysm perforating the vena cava or iliac vein comprises 0.3% to 10% of all ruptured aneurysms and is associated with a high mortality rate. 1 Acute AVF can drastically increase the preload of the right heart, thus causing acute heart failure and requiring an emergency surgical intervention. 2\n\nWhether open surgery or EVAR should be performed remains controversial. Although open surgery can accommodate a wide range of anatomical conditions and achieve reliable aneurysm resection and secure closure of the AVF, unresolved issues include the control of venous bleeding and prevention of pulmonary embolisms caused by debris or air, 3 which can be life-threatening for patients experiencing shock.\n\nEVAR is less invasive than open surgery, and the risk of major blood loss during EVAR is low compared with that in open surgery. 3 Thus, EVAR is preferred for patients with anatomical conditions that can withstand hemodynamic instability or poor preoperative conditions. Antoniou et al 4 reported that EVAR, for a major abdominal AVF, is a safe and effective treatment option that results in good short-term and mid-term results. Moreover, a recent study 5 assessed the durability of the Excluder device (W. L. Gore & Associates, Inc) over the course of 5 years and found a negligible incidence of compromised graft integrity and low aortic-related and device-related reintervention rates. In recent years, percutaneous EVAR has also been increasingly adopted in an effort to further minimize invasiveness. 6 However, our institution has limited experience with such devices. Moreover, because this case required access to both the femoral artery and vein, surgical groin exposure was considered more appropriate than percutaneous puncture.\n\nEndoleaks can occur after EVAR. Dakis et al 7 reported that endoleaks occurred in 39.5% of patients who underwent EVAR, and Orion et al 8 reported that endoleaks occurred in 50% of patients who underwent EVAR. The persistence of AVF shunts is another issue associated with EVAR. Chung et al 9 performed hybrid surgery comprising EVAR without coil embolization as damage-control therapy for a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm with an AVF and staged open surgery for a type II endoleak of the internal iliac artery; during this procedure, the internal iliac artery and inferior mesenteric artery were ligated. Another study 10 reported a similar case of an abdominal aortic aneurysm with an AVF treated with EVAR without coil embolization of the inferior mesenteric artery and careful observation of the remaining type II endoleak and AVF shunt.\n\nEVAR was anatomically feasible for our patient. To avoid shock, the AVF must be temporarily occluded before EVAR. Balloon dilatation through the right FV improved the patient's hemodynamic status. His vital signs remained stable; therefore, we were able to perform EVAR including coil embolization of the aneurysm without type II endoleaks. In addition, temporary closure of the AVF resulted in well-delineated visualization of the superior/inferior gluteal arteries from the aneurysm, without simultaneous opacification of the veins. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of a new approach to AVF management during EVAR using balloon catheter occlusion. However, if the AVF site is located at the IVC, then occlusion of the IVC may reduce systemic venous return, potentially causing a lower systemic output. Therefore, our approach is considered effective when the AVF site is distal to the IVC.\n\nConclusions\n\nWe encountered a case of a ruptured IIAA perforating the IVC that caused acute heart failure. An AVF has the potential to induce hemodynamic instability. Temporary balloon occlusion of the AVF through the FV before EVAR can stabilize the hemodynamic status, thus allowing emergency EVAR under stable conditions.\n\nFunding Support and Author Disclosures\n\nThe authors have reported that they have no relationships relevant to the contents of this paper to disclose.",
