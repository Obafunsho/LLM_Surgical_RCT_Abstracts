  "title": "Safety and Feasibility of Near Infrared Image-Guided Lymphatic Mapping of Regional Lymph Nodes in Esophageal Cancer",
  "abstract": "Objective: To assess safety and feasibility of an intraoperative, minimally invasive NIR image-guided approach to lymphatic mapping in esophageal cancer patients. Although local lymph nodes (LNs) are removed with the esophageal specimen, no techniques are available to identify the regional LNs (separate from the esophagus) during esophagectomy. We hypothesize that NIR imaging can identify regional LNs with potential to improve staging and the extent of lymphadenectomy (LAD).\n\nMethods: Of the 10 patients enrolled, nine had resectable esophageal adenocarcinoma and underwent NIR mapping following peritumoral, submucosal injection of Indocyanine Green (ICG) alone or pre-mixed in human serum albumin (ICG:HSA) prior to resection. NIR imaging was performed in situ and ex vivo.\n\nResults: Intraoperative NIR imaging demonstrated NIR signal at all tumors and in 2–6 NIR + regional LNs in six of the patients. NIR + LNs were not identified in 4 cases: one occult stage IV patient, for which further imaging was not performed and was thus excluded from analysis, and 3 cases in which ICG was used without HSA. Identification of local LNs on the esophagus was obscured by peritumoral background. Importantly, pathologic status of NIR + regional LNs reflected overall regional nodal status.\n\nConclusions: NIR lymphatic mapping is safe and feasible in esophageal cancer and can identify regional LNs when ICG:HSA is used. Although future work is needed to improve background signal and local LN identification, intraoperative detection of regional NIR + LNs allows in-depth histologic analysis of LN basins not commonly scrutinized as part of the specimen and may improve detection of occult nodal disease.",
