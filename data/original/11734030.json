Anesthetics are categorized into two classes: general anesthetics (GA) and local anesthetics (LA) [ 1 ]. GA acts on central nerves, while LA acts on nerve endings and trunks. Although the mechanism of action of the two drugs is different, both can make pain temporarily disappear, creating favorable conditions for surgery and greatly promoting the development of modern surgery [ 2 , 3 ]. Studies demonstrate that commonly used LAs, including bupivacaine (Bup) and ropivacaine (Rop), are both long-acting amide Las [ 4 ]. Bupivacaine has a strong anesthetic effect and long duration and obvious separation of sensory and motor block, but the most significant disadvantage is that the central nervous system (CNS) and cardiac toxicity is strong, excessive drugs into the circulation can cause ventricular arrhythmia, resuscitation is quite difficult [ 5 , 6 ]. Rop and Bup are similar in structural, physicochemical properties, and anesthetic efficacy, but the toxicity, especially myocardial toxicity, is significantly lower than that of Bup [ 7 , 8 ]. It has been identified that using Rop might cause neurotoxicity and also cardiotoxicity in the perioperative duration of local anesthesia effects [ 9 , 10 ]. However, the mechanism of Rop in triggering neurotoxicity is not entirely understood. To date, numerous types of research have confirmed that the neurotoxicity of anesthetics was connected to cell apoptosis [ 11 ]. Apoptosis consists of three stages: signal transduction, gene regulation, and apoptosis effect. Activation of signal transduction is the prerequisite for the initiation of apoptosis. Additionally, AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)-mediated apoptosis is a vital attribute of anesthetics-induced neurotoxicity and has been considered a therapeutic target for several neurodegenerative diseases [ 12 ].\n\nRecently, rising research suggested that neurotoxicity could be deteriorated by some neuroprotective reagents such as dexamethasone, lithium, and α‐lipoic acid [ 13 ]. Quer is a common flavonoid molecule found in many foods, with reddy or dark green vegetables being a prosperous source, and has been commonly reported as a possible neuroprotective representative in neural injury versions. Nevertheless, it stays unidentified whether Quer can relieve Rop‐induced neurotoxicity. Thus, the present research is intended to determine the functions and molecular systems of Quer in Rop-induced neurotoxicity.\n\nMaterials and methods\n\nChemicals and reagents\n\nWe purchased Quer and Rop from Sigma-Aldrich (Purity: United States Pharmacopeia Reference Standard).\n\nCell culture and ropivacaine treatment\n\nThe SH-SY5Y cell line was purchased from the Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences (Shanghai, China). The SH-SY5Y cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium NutrientMixture F-12 Ham (DMEM/F12, 1:1 mixture), supplemented with 10 % Fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 U/mL penicillin, 100 μg/mL streptomycin (37 °C, 5 % CO 2 ). The medium was replaced every two days during cell growth. To test the effect of Rop on neuronal cells, Rop solution was mixed with cell culture media to make 0.5 % and 1 % concentrations.\n\nProliferation assay\n\nThe proliferation of SH-SY5Y cells was assessed in each group using the CCK8 Kit (Solarbio) following the manufacturer's protocols. The detailed methods have been described in a previous paper [ 14 ].\n\nEdU proliferation assay\n\nThis study used the EdU (5-ethynyl-2′-deoxyuridine) proliferation test to detect cell proliferation. To test the efficacy of various medicines, SH-SY5Y cells were plated in 24-well plates at a density of 5 × 10 4 cells/well. The cells were fixed and subsequently stained with Apollo and DNA to detect cycling cells during the EdU treatment. The labeling index was calculated using fluorescence microscopy images of the cells.\n\nImmunocytochemistry (ICH) staining analysis\n\n4 % Paraformaldehyde (Sigma) was used to fix the cells, and bovine serum albumin (Sigma) was used to block them for 30 min. Cells were treated overnight at 4 °C with primary antibodies in the blocking solution. After that, the cells were incubated for 2 h at room temperature with fluorogenic secondary antibodies and then incubated with DAPI for another hour at room temperature. Laser confocal microscopy was used to image sections (Nikon, Japan).\n\nVisualization and analysis of intracellular autophagic vacuoles\n\nMonodansvleadaverine (MDC, Sigma-Aldrich) may be used to identify autophagic vacuoles. For 30 min, cells were treated with 50 μM fluorescent dye, a recognized marker for autophagic organelles. Washing three times with PBS after incubation, fluorescence microscopy was used to examine cells immediately.\n\nWestern blot assay\n\nProtein was extracted from cultured cells in RIPA buffer containing 1 mM PMSF (SolarBio, China) and separated on 8%–10 % SDS-PAGE to quantify the level of LC3 (Abcam, ab128025), Beclin1 (Abcam, ab62557), P62 (Abcam, ab91526), ATG5 (Abcam, ab228668), Bax (Proteintech, 50599-2-Ig), Bcl-2 (Proteintech, 60178-1-Ig), Caspase 3 (Proteintech, 19677-1-AP), AMPK (Cell signaling Biotechnology, #5831), p-AMPK (Cell signaling Biotechnology, #2535), mTOR (Cell signaling Biotechnology, #2983) and p-mTOR (Cell signaling Biotechnology, #5536). Then the proteins were transferred to a polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membrane (Millipore, USA) with being probed with a different antibody for 24 h at 4 °C. Afterward, and the proteins were incubated with appropriate secondary antibodies for 2 h at about 25 °C. All Western blots were repeated at least 3 times. The density of the immunoreactive bands was quantified using ImageJ software.\n\nTarget protein prediction\n\nThe target protein of Quer was performed using the PharmMapper server ( http://www.lilabecust.cn/pharmmapper/ ) PharmMapper, an online tool for identifying potential target candidates based on molecular structure [ 15 ].\n\nStatistical analysis\n\nStatistical analysis and figures were carried out using GraphPad Prism 8.0. Comparisons between groups were determined using the Student's t -test. A p -value of 0.05 or less was considered significant.\n\nResults\n\nQuercetin attenuated ropivacaine-induced cytotoxicity in SH-SY5Y\n\nWe evaluated the cytotoxicity of Rop in SH‐SY5Y cells. CCK8 assay revealed that Rop therapy at various concentrations (0, 1, 2,5, and 10 mM) caused a decrease of SH‐SY5Y cell viability in a dose‐dependent manner ( Fig. 1 A). Then the dose of 5 mM of Rop was used in the following analysis. Quer (5, 10, 15, and 20 μM) treatment did not affect the cell viability of SH‐SY5Y ( Fig. 1 B), suggesting that Quer had no cytotoxicity on SH‐SY5Y cells when its concentration reached 40 μM. As provided in Fig. 1 C, Quer pretreatment for 24 h restored cell viability in Rop-treated SH‐SY5Y cells. EdU assay was performed to detect cell proliferation, and the results showed that the EdU‐positive cells decreased in the Rop group compared to the control group, which was significantly prevented by Quer pretreatment ( Fig. 1 D). The protein level of ki67 was significantly down-regulated in the Rop group compared to the control group, but the ki67protein level was reversed in the presence of Quer ( Fig. 1 E).\n\nQuercetin attenuated ropivacaine-induced cell apoptosis in SH-SY5Y\n\nFlow cytometry results showed that apoptosis was elevated after Rop (5 mM) treatment, and the Quer rescued Rop-induced apoptosis ( Fig. 2 A), as confirmed by the increased Bcl-2 and decreased Bax and caspase 3 expression levels ( Fig. 2 B). In addition, we detected the expressions of caspase‐3 by immunofluorescence, and the results were consistent with the Western blot results ( Fig. 2 C). These results suggest that Quer moderated Rop-induced apoptosis in SH-SY5Y cells.\n\nQuercetin targets Pim1\n\nPrediction of Quer's target protein using PharmMapper ( http://www.lilabecust.cn/pharmmapper/ ) sheds light on the molecular mechanism through which Quer exerts its protective function. According to the findings, Quer may bind to the protein Pim1, which is involved in autophagy. Fig. 3 A displays the molecule and pharmacophore model. WB results showed that Quer can increase the protein level of Pim1, which can be further strongly enhanced by co-treatment with Rop and Quer ( Fig. 3 B).\n\nDownregulation of Pim1 attenuated Quer-induced autophagy in SH-SY5Y cells\n\nFig. 4 A showed strong MDC fluorescence in Quer and Rop + Quer groups, whereas MDC fluorescence decreased after the downregulation of Pim1. We observed the fluorescent punctuate distribution of LC3 by immunofluorescence staining ( Fig. 4 B). The results showed consistency with the data in Fig. 4 A. WB was used to discover autophagy-related proteins LC3II, p-62, ATG5, and Beclin 1. We found that Quer treatment improved the levels of LC3II, ATG5, and Beclin 1, while the expression of p62 was decreased and was blocked after the downregulation of Pim1 ( Fig. 4 C). These results indicate that the downregulation of Pim1 attenuated Quer-induced autophagy in SH-SY5Y cells.\n\nInhibition of Pim1 abolished the protective effect of Quer against ropivacaine in SH-SY5Y cell\n\nQuer therapy restored cell viability in SH-SY5Y cells that Rop had decreased, but downregulation of Pim1 blocked this effect ( Fig. 5 A). Additionally, inbibition of Pim1 attenuated the antiapoptotic effects of Quer on Rop-induced SH-SY5Y cells ( Fig. 5 B, C, and D).\n\nDownregulation of Pim1 attenuated Quer-induced AMPK/mTOR pathway activating in SH-SY5Y cells\n\nTo further evaluate the protection mechanism of Quer on Rop-induced cytotoxicity, SH-SY5Y cells were co-treated with Quer and Rop. As shown in Fig. 6 A, Rop + Quer markedly decreased the protein level of p-AMPK and p-mTOR, which could be significantly reversed after the downregulation of Pim1. In addition, the Western blotting analysis showed that the Rop + Quer group increased autophagy-associated proteins LC3, Beclin1, and P62, which were obviously reduced in treatment with si-Pim1 ( Fig. 6 B).\n\nDiscussion\n\nQuer was shown to protect SH-SY5Y cells against Rop-induced neurotoxicity in our investigation. Human neuroblastoma cell line SH-SY5Y is commonly utilized in cytotoxic studies because its cytotoxic reaction mimics that of human primary neuron cultures [ 16 ]. Rop suppressed cell viability and promoted neurogliacyte apoptosis, while SH-SY5Y cells were pretreated with Quer for 12 h. We found that SH-SY5Y cells' apoptosis was significantly suppressed. In addition, Quer reduced Rop-induced cytotoxicity by stimulating autophagy in SH-SY5Y cells by targeting the Pim1 protein, which could be mediated by AMPK/mTOR signaling.\n\nA prior study demonstrated that Quer could cross the blood-brain barrier in situ models [ 17 ], which implies that Quer might be a viable neuroprotective method to slow the course of degenerative diseases. Additionally, Quer inhibited the development of neuropathic pain by suppressing satellite glial cells [ 18 ]. The present study demonstrates that Rop inhibits the cell viability and induces apoptosis in SH-SY5Y cells, which was reversed by treatment with Quer. Moreover, by using the PharmMapper website and molecular docking assay, we predicted that Pim1 might be the potential target of Quer. Proto-oncogene serine/threonine-protein kinase (PIM1) is known to regulate autophagy by p21–mTOR signaling [ 19 , 20 ]. Besides, many reports have shown that Quer could inhibit the activity of Pim1 [ 21 , 22 ]. Studies have confirmed that PIM1 is involved in the cell cycle, apoptosis, and autophagy processes [ 19 ]. Autophagy is a double‐edged sword in cell survival regulation and is understood to manage apoptosis in different cell types [ 23 , 24 ]. Autophagy has additionally been recommended as a protective mechanism against LA's neurotoxicity [ 25 ]. As a result of this study, we noticed that Quer treatment improved the levels of LC3II, ATG5, and Beclin 1, while the expression of p62 was decreased and blocked after the downregulation of Pim1. These results indicate that the downregulation of Pim1 attenuated Quer-induced autophagy in SH-SY5Y cells.\n\nNext, in this study, we explored the prospective signaling pathways underlying Quer-initiated neuroprotection. It was shown that Quer might put in neuroprotective features via the neurotrophic signaling pathway [ 26 ]. This research discovered that Quer undermined Rop-induced cytotoxicity in SH-SY5Y cells via the AMPK/mTOR pathway. Inhibition of AMPK significantly reverses the effects of Quer on Rop-induced cytotoxicity in SH-SY5Y cells, suggesting that quercetin activates an AMPK-regulated autophagy signaling pathway, which may offer a protective effect in Rop-induced cytotoxicity in SH-SY5Y. Stress triggers the protein kinase AMPK, activated when cells experience an energy shortage. mTOR is a serine/threonine kinase downstream of AMPK that promotes anabolic metabolism and inhibits autophagy induction [ 27 , 28 ]. By increasing AMPK activity and increasing Nrf 2 pathway-mediated antioxidative defenses, Quer improves cognitive impairment caused by domoic acid in rats [ 29 ]. However, solubility of Quer for its clinical applications. The nano-formulation of quercetin, particularly in the forms of liposomal encapsulation and cellulose nanocrystal loading, offers promising advancements in enhancing the bioavailability and therapeutic efficacy of Quer [ [30] , [31] , [32] ].\n\nIn conclusion, this study's results indicate that Quer could provide neuroprotection against Rop‐induced neurotoxicity in SH‐SY5Y cells by targeting the Pim1 protein, which was accomplished via regulating the AMPK/mTOR pathway. As a result of these findings, Quer might be used to treat human neurotoxicity caused by Rop.\n\nEthical approval\n\nNot Applicable.\n\nFunding\n\nThis work was supported by grants CLB19J051 from Scientific Research Project of Military Logistic and 18PJ159 from Scientific Research Project of 10.13039/501100020207 Sichuan Provincial Health Commission .\n\nData availability statement\n\nAll data generated or analyzed during this study are included in this published article.\n\nCRediT authorship contribution statement\n\nYinghai Liu: Writing – review & editing, Writing – original draft, Methodology, Formal analysis, Data curation.
