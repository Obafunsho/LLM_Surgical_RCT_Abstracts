  "abstract": "Objectives: The goal of this study is to assess the safety, feasibility and clinical outcomes of prophylactic fibrinogen administration in paediatric scoliosis surgery.\n\nDesign: Prospective, two-arm, randomised, double-blind pilot trial.\n\nSetting: Single-centre study conducted at a tertiary care hospital specialising in scoliosis surgery.\n\nParticipants: 32 children undergoing scoliosis surgery entered and completed the study. The inclusion criteria were elective scoliosis surgery, age <18 years, provision of a signed informed consent form by both parents and consent to contraception use for the duration of this clinical trial among sexually active (≥15 years of age) participants. The exclusion criteria were diagnosed congenital or acquired coagulopathy, use of anticoagulants other than perioperative prophylactic administration of low molecular weight heparin to prevent venous thromboembolism, known hypersensitivity to the active substance or any excipients in the investigated medicinal product, history of deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism, pregnancy and lactation.\n\nInterventions: Participants were randomised 1:1 to a standard group, receiving standard blood and coagulation management, or a fibrinogen group, receiving a single prophylactic dose of fibrinogen concentrate in addition to standard care.\n\nPrimary and secondary outcome measures: Safety, the primary objective, was assessed according to adverse events, serious adverse events and other safety parameters. Secondary objectives included feasibility and clinical outcomes.\n\nResults: In the fibrinogen group, 101 adverse events across 19 types were observed, whereas in the standard group, 95 adverse events across 21 types (p>0.9999) and one serious adverse event were observed. No adverse events of special interest or deaths occurred in either group. Blood loss did not significantly differ between the fibrinogen (1021.88 mL (SD 473.63)) and standard (859.38 mL (SD 713.03)) groups (p=0.1677). The mean length of hospital stay was 8.88 (SD 0.81) days in the fibrinogen group and 9.25 (SD 1.88) days in the standard group (p=0.9210). No statistically significant differences in the use of blood transfusions, blood derivatives, crystalloids or colloids were observed between groups.\n\nConclusions: This study demonstrates that the prophylactic administration of fibrinogen during scoliosis surgery in children is feasible and appears to be safe. Due to the limited sample size, no conclusions can be drawn regarding the efficacy of pre-emptive fibrinogen administration on clinical outcomes.

  "full_text": "Background\n\nScoliosis, one of the most common spinal deformities in paediatrics, has an average prevalence of 2–3% worldwide. 1 2 Scoliosis is usually defined as a lateral curvature of the spine measuring >10° in the coronal plane on an X-ray. However, this condition is a complex multidimensional structural spine deformity resulting from rotation, angulation and curvature abnormalities in all three axes. 3 5 The progression of the scoliotic curve over time, particularly during rapid growth periods, changes the shape and size of the rib cage and thorax, thus leading to respiratory, cardiovascular, gastrointestinal and psychosocial disorders affecting multiple organs. Scoliotic curve progression is also associated with back pain. 6 Scoliosis treatments are aimed at stopping the progression of curve deviation and thus preventing the development of multiple-organ diseases. 7 Treatment options for scoliosis include observation, physiotherapy, bracing and surgery. The choice of treatment method depends on the severity and progression of the scoliotic curve. A common indication for surgical treatment is progressive deviation of the scoliotic curve and a Cobb angle >40°.\n\nScoliosis surgery is challenging because of long operation times, body temperature management, positioning, intraoperative neurophysiological monitoring and high blood losses. 8 9 Blood transfusions in the perioperative period are required in approximately 30%–60% of cases and are associated with prolonged hospital stays, increased costs and mortality. 10 11 Strategies to decrease blood loss and the need for transfusions are therefore warranted; these strategies include antifibrinolytic treatment (eg, tranexamic acid), hypothermia prevention and cell salvage. 12 14\n\nRecently, attention has been paid to fibrinogen, a coagulation factor essential for clot formation during haemostasis. 15 16 Hypo/dysfibrinogenaemia can lead to severe bleeding during high-risk surgeries. 17 20 Moreover, some studies have reported less blood loss in patients with higher preoperative fibrinogen levels. 21 22 The effects of prophylactic fibrinogen administration have been reported in cardiovascular or urological surgery, and decreased blood loss and transfusion requirements have been observed. 23 25 Early intraoperative fibrinogen administration, compared with late administration, has been found to decrease transfusion volume and blood loss in children undergoing surgery for craniosynostosis but not for scoliosis. However, the scoliotic population in the trial was small. 26 The effects of prophylactic fibrinogen administration in the paediatric population undergoing scoliosis surgery, particularly regarding safety and the magnitude of blood loss, remain unclear. This study was aimed at assessing the safety, efficacy and feasibility of prophylactic fibrinogen administration in paediatric scoliosis surgery.\n\nMethods\n\nStudy design and participants\n\nThis two-arm, single-centre, randomised, double-blind trial was conducted between June 2022 and October 2023 at a tertiary teaching hospital in the Czech Republic. All patients admitted for elective scoliosis surgery were screened for eligibility. The inclusion criteria were elective scoliosis surgery, age <18 years at the time of enrolment, provision of a signed informed consent form by both parents and consent to contraception use for the duration of this clinical trial among sexually active (≥15 years of age) participants.\n\nThe exclusion criteria were diagnosed congenital or acquired coagulopathy, use of anticoagulants other than perioperative prophylactic administration of low molecular weight heparin to prevent venous thromboembolism, known hypersensitivity to the active substance or any excipients in the investigated medicinal product, history of deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism, pregnancy and lactation. After provision of informed consent, each patient was randomised to one of the trial arms. The randomisation procedure was implemented in an electronic case report form with a randomisation ratio of 1:1. The study statistician generated the randomisation list, which the study data manager implemented in the electronic case report form. Allocation concealment was ensured with a web-based randomisation system. The generation of the allocation sequence was embedded in the trial website. The study investigator enrolled participants and randomised them with the web-based randomisation system. The patient and treating physicians and nurses were blinded to the study intervention. An unblinded investigator performed the randomisation before induction to the anaesthesia, and the study medication was prepared by the unblinded study nurse outside the operating theatre. It was administered/non-administered after induction of anaesthesia before the beginning of surgery under the supervision of an unblinded investigator. The blinded surgical and anaesthesia team was outside of the operating theatre during the administration/non-administration of fibrinogen. The data management group and statisticians worked with a pseudo-anonymised data set. The detailed methods of this study have been published as a protocol. 16 No interim safety analysis was conducted, as the study was designed to explore safety. The study is reported according to CONSORT guidelines. 27\n\nInterventions\n\nStandard of care\n\nIn one arm of the study (STANDARD), all participants received standard of care blood and coagulation management for scoliosis surgery according to the local protocol, which adheres to international guidelines. 28 Standard blood and coagulation tests were performed before the surgery. Tranexamic acid was administered intravenously before the skin incision at a dose of 10–15 mg/kg. A restrictive approach was used to administer blood transfusions, plasma derivatives and fluids. The indications for administration depended on clinical judgement, according to assessment of blood loss, blood test results and vital signs. The thresholds were set to Hb at 70–90 g/L, fibrinogen at >2 g/L and platelets at >50×109 /L. In the event of life-threatening bleeding, the transfusion strategy of fibrinogen concentrates and red blood cells or fresh frozen plasma in a ratio of at least 1:2 was used.\n\nIntervention group\n\nParticipants randomised to the second arm (FIBRINOGEN) received the standard of care. In addition, a single dose of 20–30 mg/kg of fibrinogen was administered intravenously before the skin incision.\n\nOutcome measures\n\nPrimary outcome\n\nThe primary outcome of the study was the safety assessment of prophylactic fibrinogen administration in scoliosis surgery in children.\n\nThis primary outcome monitoring followed European directive 2001/20/EC. 29 According to this directive, the safety assessment included the incidence of adverse events (AEs), adverse drug reactions, serious AEs, serious adverse reactions, unexpected adverse reactions and suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions, which were compared between study groups.\n\nSecondary outcomes\n\nAdditional safety information\n\nAEs of special interest (AESI), including deep vein thrombosis verified on ultrasound imaging, pulmonary embolism confirmed on CT scan and infection or healing disorder requiring re-surgery and/or the initiation of antibiotic therapy, were monitored. Intensive care unit (ICU) and hospital length of stay (LOS) and 28-day mortality were also assessed.\n\nFeasibility\n\nThe following parameters were analysed in the study feasibility assessment: the recruitment rate of eligible patients approached for consent to participate (with a feasibility criterion of >75% of enrolled participants), the percentage of missing outcomes and clinical data (with an aim of <10% missing outcome data and <10% missing clinical data obtained from patient records).\n\nClinical outcomes\n\nThe analysed clinical outcomes included demographic data, total volume blood loss, blood loss per one fused level, number of patients receiving transfusion products or blood derivatives, number of administered transfusions and blood derivatives (red blood cells, thrombocytes of apheresis, fresh frozen plasma, fibrinogen concentrate, prothrombin complex concentrate), volume of administered fluids (crystalloid or colloids), urine output within the 24 hours after the surgery, blood counts (haemoglobin, haematocrit and platelets) and coagulation parameters (fibrinogen, activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), prothrombin time (PT) and thrombin time (TT)) before surgery, at the end of surgery and 24 hours after surgery.\n\nSample size and power considerations\n\nBecause this study was a pilot study, a power calculation to determine sample size was not required. By considering pilot study standards and guidelines, we set the sample size to 30 participants, with 15 per study arm. 30 32 According to the expectation of a 5% dropout rate, the final sample size was set to 32 participants (16 per arm). 33\n\nStatistics\n\nThe statistical analyses were performed according to a previously published protocol. 16 Categorical data are presented as numbers and percentages. For continuous data, the mean, SD, median, minimum and maximum were calculated. Test for normality (Shapiro-Wilk test) was used together with visual inspection of data (histograms and Q-Q plots were used) for continuous parameters. For comparison of continuous variables between treatment groups, the two-sample t-test or its non-parametric alternative, the Mann-Whitney U test, was used, as appropriate. For categorical parameters, Fisher’s exact test was used when assumptions for Pearson’s χ2 test were not met (ie, at least one expected frequency was <5 in contingency table). All statistical tests were two-sided, and p values <0.05 were considered to indicate statistically significant differences. Analyses were conducted on an intention-to-treat basis and missing data were not imputed. The statistical analyses were performed in SAS version 9.4. The study statistical analysis plan is available in online supplemental file 1 .\n\nEthical considerations and data protection\n\nThe study was approved by University Hospital Brno’s Ethics Committee (No 24/22MONO) and by State Institute for Drug Control (No sukls11048/2022), and was conducted in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. The study was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov ( NCT05391412 , date of approval 6 May 2022). No later than 3 years after the collection of the 1-year post-randomisation, a completely blinded data set will be delivered to an appropriate data repository for sharing purposes.\n\nPatient and public involvement\n\nPatients and/or the public were not involved in the design, or conduct, or reporting or dissemination plans of this research.\n\nResults\n\nCharacteristics of the study sample\n\nBetween 8 June 2022 and 14 June 2023, a total of 32 children with adolescent idiopathic scoliosis undergoing scoliosis surgery were enrolled in this study. The mean age was 13.8 years, and nine (28.1%) participants were boys. The demographic characteristics between groups were comparable, except for the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) score, which showed a difference that was not statistically significant, as demonstrated in table 1 .\n\nPrimary outcome\n\nRegarding the primary outcome, safety, all patients in both groups showed some AEs. A total of 101 AEs of 19 types were observed in the FIBRINOGEN group. In the STANDARD group, 95 AEs of 21 types were observed. These AEs were of grades 1–3, whereas no AEs of grades 4 and 5 were observed. In the STANDARD group, one serious AE occurred, which required reoperation because of breakage of the implanted rod. Throughout the study, we observed no adverse drug reactions, serious adverse reactions, unexpected adverse reactions or suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions. The detailed list of individual AEs is presented in table 2 . The difference in AEs between groups was not statistically significant.\n\nSecondary outcomes\n\nNo AESI were observed in both groups. The mean LOS was 8.88 (SD 0.81) days in the FIBRINOGEN group and 9.25 (SD 1.88) days in the STANDARD group (p=0.9210). The mean ICU LOS was 3.38 (SD 1.09) days in the FIBRINOGEN group and 3.63 (SD 1.63) days in the STANDARD group (p=0.9069). No significant differences were observed between groups in either measure. No patients died during the 28-day observation period.\n\nFeasibility\n\nThe patient enrolment process is shown in figure 1 . Ultimately, 32 participants were enrolled, and the recruitment rate of eligible patients approached for consent was 88.9%, exceeding the required threshold of 75%. The percentage of missing outcome data (LOS, ICU LOS and 28-day survival) was 0%, a value well below the required threshold of 10%. The percentage of missing clinical data (clinical medical notes and electronic patient records) was 0.0047% (7 of 1504), a value also below the required threshold of 10%.\n\nClinical outcomes\n\nAnother aspect of the secondary outcomes was the comparison of selected haematological parameters before, during and 24 hours after surgery, and the comparison of blood loss during and 24 hours after surgery between groups ( table 3 ). A statistically significant difference was observed in platelet count, which was higher in the STANDARD group at the end of surgery (mean 222.88 (SD 53.03) vs 184.50 (SD 46.75); p=0.0379) and 24 hours after surgery (mean 202.44 (SD 43.31) vs 170.50 (SD 32.56); p=0.0251). Another statistically significant difference was observed in PT at the end of surgery: in the STANDARD group (mean 17.83 s (SD 1.73) vs 19.38 s (SD 2.17); p=0.0371), PT was shorter than the standard range of 11.0–17.0 s. Blood loss did not differ significantly between the FIBRINOGEN and STANDARD groups during surgery (mean 1021.88 mL (SD 473.63) vs 859.38 mL (SD 713.03); p=0.1677) and 24 hours after surgery (mean 290.0 mL (SD 79.55) vs 326.43 mL (SD 93.86); p=0.4983). The administration of blood transfusions, blood derivatives, crystalloids and colloids showed no statistically significant differences between groups ( table 4 ).\n\nDiscussion\n\nHere, we present the results of a pilot study exploring the safety and feasibility of prophylactic fibrinogen administration in paediatric scoliosis surgery. Supplementation with fibrinogen, an essential coagulation factor, is currently a discussed topic. However, the influence of prophylactic administration, particularly in the paediatric population before high-risk surgery, remains unclear. To our knowledge, this study is the first trial examining the safety and feasibility of prophylactic fibrinogen administration in this population. Regarding safety, the incidence of AEs of grades 1–3 was comparable and showed no statistically significant differences between groups. Most monitored AEs, such as anaemia, leukocytopenia, tachycardia or high body temperature, were complications of the major surgery with blood loss and are part of postoperative systemic inflammatory response syndrome, as previously described. 34 36 No AEs of grades 4 or 5 occurred in either group. A comparison of the incidence of serious AEs in both groups revealed only one case of a patient with a prolonged hospital stay and need for reoperation in the STANDARD group. However, a second surgery was indicated for rod breakage, a surgical complication. The observed need for reoperation in 1 of 16 patients was comparable to that in the most extensive study published in 2022, in which the reoperation rate was 6.0%. 37 Thus, the authors did not assume a significant effect of fibrinogen on the occurrence of AEs, as confirmed by our findings of no AESI in either the FIBRINOGEN STANDARD group. The differences in ICU LOS and hospital LOS were not statistically significant in both groups. Our hospital LOS findings were comparable to those in a study from Syracuse, USA, in which the average hospital LOS between 1997 and 2012 was 8 days. 38 Another study from Denmark has reported a mean LOS of 8 days in more than 1300 patients. 39 In contrast, other studies have described shorter hospital LOS of 4.9 days and 5.4 days. 40 41 The variations among studies are likely to be due to the different surgical approaches, healthcare systems or methods for counting days of hospitalisation. Therefore, we conclude that the prophylactic fibrinogen administration appears safe and to have no effect on LOS. Our study demonstrated 0% mortality in both groups at 28 days. This finding is in accordance with those from prior studies, although the number of patients included in our study did not allow for a relevant comparison. 38 39 Thus, the prophylactic fibrinogen administration before scoliosis surgery is likely to be safe.\n\nIn terms of feasibility, most patients met the inclusion criteria, and fibrinogen was able to be administered. The main challenge arose from national legislation requiring both parents of each patient to provide signed informed consent in studies of paediatric patients. Because University Hospital Brno is one of the largest scoliotic centres in Central Europe, the travel distance to Brno is long, and both parents are often unable to travel with their children to admission. However, the requirement to obtain the signatures of both parents ended after the enforcement of EU Regulation 536/2014. 42 We therefore assume that easier patient recruitment in the future will enable more extensive studies to be conducted. The missing outcomes and clinical data percentages were both below the pre-set threshold of 10%. Therefore, on the basis of the above considerations, we conclude that a future large study would be feasible.\n\nRegarding clinical outcomes, the measured blood loss during surgery was higher in the FIBRINOGEN group than in the standard group, but the difference was not statistically significant. The blood loss was comparable to that in a study by Wang et al in 765 adolescent patients with idiopathic scoliosis undergoing posterior spinal fusion surgery, in which the measured blood loss reached 926.8 ± 521.1 mL. 43 Our study population showed variability in blood loss, with a minimum value as much as 10 times lower than the maximum. Therefore, we adjusted the measurements by converting absolute blood loss to relative blood loss per fused level. Although higher mean blood losses per fused level were observed in the FIBRINOGEN group than the STANDARD group during surgery, the differences were not statistically significant. The mean blood loss in both groups in the present study was lower than the reported mean blood loss of 123.9 mL per fused level in a study by Modi et al , which used a similar normalisation method. 44 Blood loss may be influenced by several external factors. Differences in bone age, bone density and intraoperative haemodynamic parameters contribute to patient variability. 44 The surgeon’s experience also plays a role, and inaccuracies in measuring blood loss may exist. 45 We note the nearly significant difference in ASA scores between the groups, with a mean of 1.63 in the FIBRINOGEN group vs 1.25 in the STANDARD group (p=0.068). The monitored haematological parameters revealed that the platelet count was statistically significantly higher in the STANDARD group than the FIBRINOGEN group at the end of surgery and 24 hours postoperatively. Studies focused on preoperative prophylactic administration of fibrinogen have often not reported platelet count dynamics. However, a study by Kwapisz et al , which focused on high-risk cardiac surgery, did not demonstrate this phenomenon. 46 In a study by Karlsson et al , platelet aggregability increased in the group that received prophylactic fibrinogen before cardiac surgery, but no trend toward a platelet count decrease was observed in this group. 47 This finding might potentially explain our findings; however, further research is required to comprehensively elucidate this phenomenon.\n\nLike any clinical study, this research has certain limitations that must be acknowledged for accurate interpretation of the results. First, the inability to include children without both parents present to provide informed consent substantially restricted patient enrolment and might potentially have exacerbated selection bias. This limitation might have been further accentuated by the small sample size, which was nevertheless expected, given the pilot study context. Second, AEs were not specifically predefined but were recorded at the discretion of the investigators; consequently, either an overestimation or underestimation of the reported number of AEs might have resulted. Another limitation of this study was the short 28-day follow-up, as some thromboembolic events or wound complications can emerge after 4 weeks. Furthermore, clinical outcomes, including laboratory values and blood loss, can be influenced by multiple factors. A notable strength of this study is that all participants had idiopathic scoliosis, and the demographics were largely uniform across groups (except for ASA scores, which present an additional limitation). The authors assume that our sample is worldwide representative as scoliosis surgery is primarily focused in a limited number of hospitals. Specifically, there are only two centres in the Czech Republic. In addition, our centre, with almost 300 scoliosis surgeries per year, is one of the largest centres in Europe. From this perspective, our sample is assumed to be demographically and characteristically representative. Although the single-centre design ensured strong adherence to protocols and standardised procedures, it could not completely eliminate interindividual differences among the attending anaesthesiologists and attending surgeons.\n\nConclusions\n\nIn conclusion, this study demonstrates that the prophylactic administration of fibrinogen during scoliosis surgery in children is feasible and appears to be safe. Due to the limited sample size, no conclusions can be drawn regarding the efficacy of pre-emptive fibrinogen administration on clinical outcomes. However, the results provide valuable data to inform sample size calculation and feasibility considerations for a future full-scale randomised controlled trial.",
