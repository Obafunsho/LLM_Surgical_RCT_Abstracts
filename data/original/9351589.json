  "title": "A randomized phase II trial of adjuvant hepatic arterial infusion and systemic therapy with or without panitumumab after hepatic resection of KRAS wild-type colorectal cancer",
  "abstract": "Objective/Background:: The purpose was to determine whether adding Pmab versus no Pmab to an adjuvant regimen of HAI of floxuridine (FUDR) plus systemic (SYS) leucovorin, fluorouracil, and irinotecan (FOLFIRI) improves 15-month recurrence-free survival (RFS) for patients with RAS wild-type (WT) colorectal cancer. Secondary endpoints included overall survival (OS), toxicity, and influence of predictive biomarkers.\n\nMethods:: This phase II trial randomized patients with K RAS WT resected colorectal liver metastases (CRLM) to adjuvant HAI FUDR + SYS FOLFIRI +/− Pmab ( NCT01312857 ). Patients were stratified by clinical risk score and previous chemotherapy. Based on an exact binomial design, if one arm had ≥24 patients alive and disease-free at 15 months that regimen was considered promising for further investigation.\n\nResults:: Seventy-five patients were randomized. Patient characteristics and toxicity were not different in the two arms, except for rash in +Pmab arm. Grade 3/4 elevation in bilirubin or alkaline phosphatase did not differ in the two arms. Twenty-five (69%; 95% CI, 53 to 82) patients in the Pmab arm versus 18 (47%; 95% CI, 32 to 63) patients in the arm without Pmab were alive and recurrence-free at 15 months. Only the Pmab arm met the decision rule, while the other arm did not. After median follow-up of 56.6 months, 3-year RFS was 57% (95% CI, 43 to 76) and 42% (95% CI, 29 to 61), and 3-year OS was 97% (95% CI, 90 to 99) and 91% (95% CI, 83 to 99), +/− Pmab, respectively.\n\nConclusions:: The addition of Pmab to HAI FUDR + SYS FOLFIRI showed promising activity without increased biliary toxicity and should be further investigated in a larger trial.",
