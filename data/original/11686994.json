  "title": "ASSOCIATION OF LATERAL PELVIC LYMPH NODES WITH DISEASE RECURRENCE AND ORGAN PRESERVATION IN PATIENTS WITH DISTAL RECTAL ADENOCARCINOMA TREATED WITH TOTAL NEOADJUVANT THERAPY",
  "abstract": "Objective:: Assess the significance of enlarged lateral lymph nodes (LLN) for disease recurrence, metastasis, and organ preservation in patients with rectal cancer.\n\nBackground:: Optimal treatment of rectal adenocarcinoma involving LLN is subject to debate.\n\nMethods:: A post hoc analysis of the OPRA trial, a multicenter study of patients with rectal cancer treated with total neoadjuvant therapy (TNT) followed by total mesorectal excision or watch-and-wait management. We analyzed the association of visible LLN (LLN+), LLN ≥ 7 mm (short axis) on baseline MRI, and LLN ≥ 4 mm on restaging MRI with recurrence, metastasis, and rectum preservation.\n\nResults:: At baseline, 57 out of 324 (18%) patients had LLN+. In 30 (53%) of 57 patients with LLN+ on baseline MRI, the LLN disappeared after TNT. Disease recurrence in LLN was rare (3.5% of patients with LLN+ and 0.4% of patients with LLN−). All patients with recurrence in LLN also had distant metastasis. The rate of organ preservation was significantly lower in patients with LLN ≥ 4 mm on restaging MRI ( P = 0.013). We found no significant differences in rates of local recurrence or metastasis between patients with LLN+ vs. LLN− and in patients with LLN ≥ 7 vs. < 7 mm on baseline MRI. LLN dissection was performed in 3 patients; 2 of them died of distant metastasis.\n\nConclusions:: LLN involvement is not associated with disease recurrence or metastasis, but persistence of LLN ≥ 4 mm after TNT is negatively associated with rectum preservation in patients with locally advanced rectal cancer treated with TNT. Dissection of lateral nodes likely benefits few patients.",
