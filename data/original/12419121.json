  "abstract": "Objective:: The primary objective was to evaluate agreement between researchers’ and family members’ postoperative delirium assessment. The secondary objective was to assess the incidence of positive FAM-CAM after hospital discharge up to 30-days postoperatively.\n\nMethods:: This was a pre-specified sub-study of two multicenter randomized controlled trials that evaluated interventions to prevent postoperative delirium in older adults undergoing major elective surgery. In the hospital, delirium was ascertained using the Confusion Assessment Method (CAM) long-form or the Confusion Assessment Method for the Intensive Care Unit (CAM-ICU), and structured chart review. Family members completed a Family Confusion Assessment Method (FAM-CAM) concurrent with researchers’ assessments in the afternoons on postoperative days 1–3. At the time of hospital discharge, a booklet of FAM-CAM surveys was provided to complete daily until postoperative day 30. Agreement between researcher-rated CAM/CAM-ICU and family-rated FAM-CAM was analyzed using Generalized Linear Mixed Model with repeated measures, and Bland-Altman analysis. Inter-rater reliability for each instrument was modeled using intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). Overall agreement beyond chance between researcher’s assessment and the FAM-CAM was evaluated using repeated measure Cohen’s Kappa and sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predicted values. Post-discharge FAM-CAM data were summarized descriptively.\n\nResults:: A total of 817 patients had 1349 concurrent delirium assessments. Postoperative delirium incidence by researchers’ assessment was 18.8 % and detection of delirium symptoms by FAM-CAM was 22.4 %. Analysis comparing delirium assessments showed there is an observed agreement beyond chance of 79.7 % with a kappa of 0.33 between the assessments by Generalized Linear Mixed Modeling with repeated measures, treating patients and raters as random effects, with FAM-CAM being more likely to report a positive delirium outcome. Assessment by features showed similar results. Both methods had an excellent degree of internal validity (CAM/CAM-ICU intraclass correlation =0.938, FAM-CAM intraclass correlation = 0.985). Repeated measures Cohen’s kappa indicated good overall agreement (kappa = 0.72 [95 % confidence interval, 0.63 to 0.81]). Of the 330 booklets, 133 (40.3 %) were returned. A total of 18 patients exhibited symptoms indicative of delirium based on the FAM-CAM assessment between hospital discharge and 30 days postoperatively. Out of these, 9 (50 %) had also been diagnosed with postoperative delirium during their hospitalization.\n\nConclusion:: This study demonstrated that family member completed FAM-CAM had acceptable agreement with researchers’ delirium assessments. Postoperative delirium symptoms were detected more frequently by family-administered FAM-CAM compared to delirium incidence identified by researcher assessments. Family members identified that some patients experienced delirium symptoms after hospital discharge.",

  "full_text": "Introduction\n\nPostoperative delirium is a common complication following surgery, characterized by (i) an acute fluctuating change in mental status, (ii) inattention, and (iii) disorganized thinking or (iv) altered level of consciousness [ 1 ]. Postoperative delirium is associated with longer hospital stays, increased morbidity and mortality, and an increased financial burden on the healthcare system [ 2 , 3 ]. Multi-component non-pharmacological interventions such as light and sleep therapy, hydration and adequate nutrition, exercise, and cognitive therapy can mitigate delirium incidence, duration, severity, and long-term negative outcomes [ 4 – 6 ]. Consistent implementation of these interventions, combined with early detection of delirium, are essential to improve patient outcomes in older adults following major surgery.\n\nWhile there are no “gold standard” tools for detecting postoperative delirium, the Confusion Assessment Method (CAM) [ 7 ] and the Confusion Assessment Method for the Intensive Care Unit (CAM-ICU) [ 8 ] are well validated delirium assessment tools but require training and are not usually translated into standard care strategies for delirium detection. Although there is a plethora of literature on delirium in the postoperative period, it often goes undiagnosed or unrecognized [ 9 ]. Often, healthcare professionals are not well trained to look for symptoms of delirium, lack effective screening tools, or delirium diagnosis is missed due to its fluctuating nature [ 9 ]. Family members, caregivers, or friends may recognize unusual symptoms not characteristic of their family members that the healthcare professionals may miss [ 10 ]. Therefore, engaging caregivers, family, or friends is essential to improve early identification of delirium symptoms in the postoperative period when patients are the most vulnerable [ 11 ].\n\nThe Family Confusion Assessment Method (FAM-CAM) [ 12 ] is an 11-question delirium screening tool developed for this purpose. Based on the scoring of the CAM, it is designed to increase caregivers’ awareness of delirium symptoms, enabling families to bring these symptoms to medical attention and facilitating the diagnostic and therapeutic process [ 12 ]. In preliminary research, the FAM-CAM has been shown to have good agreement with the CAM [ 12 – 14 ] and has been applied across various settings, including the community, emergency department, ICU, skilled nursing centers, intermediate and post-acute care settings in multiple countries [ 13 – 19 ] While available evidence supports the FAM-CAM’s strong performance in detecting delirium in adults across these settings, studies specifically examining its performance in postoperative hospital settings and after hospital discharge are limited [ 17 , 20 ].\n\nPostoperative delirium during hospitalization after major surgery has been well characterized in different patient populations, but there is little research on delirium following hospital discharge [ 21 ]. This is especially relevant because there may be less active monitoring, care, and vigilance at patients’ homes. With the large number of older adults undergoing major elective surgery and many of them discharged home early, it could be helpful if family caregivers are able to assess for delirium symptoms, especially after hospital discharge [ 22 , 23 ]. Identification of such symptoms could prompt timely follow-up and a formal assessment by a clinician, potentially leading to clinically relevant interventions.\n\nThe first objective of this study was to assess agreement between the researchers’ concurrent postoperative delirium assessment (CAM/CAM-ICU) and the FAM-CAM in older adults undergoing major elective surgery during postoperative days 1–3. The second objective was to characterize whether this patient population experiences delirium symptoms resulting in a positive FAM-CAM after hospital discharge up to 30 days postoperatively, by family report.\n\nMethods\n\nRecruitment\n\nPatients were recruited to the Electroencephalography Guidance of Anesthesia to Alleviate Geriatric Syndromes (ENGAGES) study or the Prevention of Delirium and Complications Associated with Surgical Treatments (PODCAST) study [ 24 – 27 ]. This was a pre-specified sub-study of both the ENGAGES and POCAST studies [ 24 , 25 ]. Patients eligible for the ENGAGES study were 60 years or older, able to give informed consent, and scheduled for major elective surgery under general anesthesia with a potent volatile anesthetic, requiring at least a 2-day postoperative hospital stay [ 25 ]. Patients eligible for the PODCAST study were 60 years or older, able to give informed consent, and undergoing major open cardiac surgery or major non-cardiac surgeries under general anesthesia [ 24 ]. All patients provided written informed consent. This sub-study was approved by the Washington University Institutional Review Board. This manuscript follows the STROBE reporting guidelines for observational studies [ 28 ].\n\nDelirium assessment training\n\nResearch staff completed a structured training regimen prior to completing any postoperative delirium assessments as previously described [ 25 , 29 ]. Research members also were instructed on training family members to complete the FAM-CAM using standardized training materials and procedures, reviewing The Family Confusion Assessment Method (FAM-CAM) Instrument and Training Manual, and completing an in-person training session by a researcher trained in delirium assessments [ 12 ]. Family members were instructed on completing the FAM-CAM per the instruction guide provided in the training manual. Family members or close friends were asked to be objective when completing the FAM-CAM; any key features of delirium that were present as well as changes from usual preoperative behavior were reported and marked as present. Only individuals living with the patient, or those who had seen the patient at least once a month and knew the patient well enough to report mental and physical abilities about the patient were asked to complete the FAM-CAM survey.\n\nDelirium assessments in the hospital\n\nAfter surgery, patients were assessed for postoperative delirium by trained research staff per study protocols [ 24 , 25 ]. For the ENGAGES study, patients were assessed daily on postoperative days (POD) 1–5 in the afternoon using the CAM or CAM-ICU, and with structured delirium chart review as the combined approach increases the sensitivity of delirium detection and provides a more comprehensive detection of delirium [ 30 – 32 ]. Patients in the PODCAST study were assessed on POD 1–3 in both the morning and afternoon using the CAM or CAM-ICU. Delirium was assessed using the CAM preferentially in both studies. The CAM-ICU was used for patients who were unable to speak (e.g. tracheal tube or tracheostomy in place) and who were not sedated beyond a Richmond Agitation and Sedation Scale > − 4, or for those patients who refused the full CAM assessment. The CAM assessment has been validated in older adults across multiple care settings, including the intensive care unit, emergency department, and outpatient clinics [ 33 , 34 ]. Additionally, the CAM-ICU has been well studied in critically ill patients [ 8 , 35 , 36 ]. Both the CAM and the CAM–ICU have exhibited sensitivity of 94–100 %, specificity of 89–95 % compared to a geriatric psychiatrist using Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-IV criteria [ 37 ]. For the CAM and CAM-ICU, standard algorithm-based scoring criteria was applied as originally validated [ 7 , 8 ]. For the structured delirium chart review in the ENGAGES study, trained staff blinded to the intervention of the respective study and to the CAM/CAM-ICU assessment results reviewed the patients’ medical records including nurses’ notes, progress notes, consult notes, specialist reports, ICD codes, cognitive assessments and nursing delirium assessments for any evidence of acute confusional state. Any evidence including but not limited to words such as delirium, mental status change, inattention, disorientation, hallucinations, agitation, or inappropriate behavior was documented from the chart verbatim for each day POD 1–5 and sent to an external expert panel for adjudication [ 25 ]. For the structured chart review, published methodology and criteria for retrospective identification of delirium, as described in prior validation studies, was used [ 30 , 31 ].\n\nIn both studies, if a relative was present during the researcher’s assessment, they were asked to complete the FAM-CAM prior, during, or shortly after the researcher’s delirium assessment. The FAM-CAM has been validated in older adults who are cognitively intact as well as in individuals with dementia both in clinic and hospital settings. The FAM-CAM has shown to have good agreement with the CAM (sensitivity 88 % (95 % CI 47–99 %), specificity 98 % (95 % CI 86–100 %) as well as with rigorous assessments using Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-IV criteria [ 12 ] (sensitivity 75 % (95 % CI 35–95 %), specificity 91 % (95 % CI 74–97 %). The FAM-CAM was independently reviewed and scored by a separate blinded research staff member according to previously validated evaluation criteria [ 12 ]. For the primary objective, patients with concurrent CAM/CAM-ICU and FAM-CAM assessments completed in the afternoon of POD 1–3 from either study were included in the analysis.\n\nDelirium assessments after hospital discharge\n\nPrior to discharge or on the last day of assessments, family members of 330 participants in the ENGAGES study were given a FAM-CAM booklet and instructed to complete daily FAM-CAM surveys up to POD 30 and return the booklet by mail. A total of 1213 participants were able to complete at least one delirium assessment POD 1–5 (i.e. not sedated or deceased). Of those assessable, 883 were not provided FAM-CAM booklets for one of the following reasons: the patient was discharged early and missed providing a booklet, the patient did not have family members present at the time of the last delirium assessment, the patient was to be discharged to a nursing facility where no family member was available, the patient lived alone and did not have family members to complete a booklet, or the family declined to complete. There were no researcher’s delirium assessments or chart review performed after POD 5, during the 30-day follow-up period. For the second objective, both the researcher’s CAM/CAM-ICU and structured chart review on POD 1–5 from the ENGAGES study were used to assess the trajectory of postoperative in-hospital delirium.\n\nStatistical analysis\n\nAgreement between researchers’ and family members’ delirium assessments (Primary objective)\n\nCharacteristics are presented as descriptive statistics for those patients who had concurrent CAM/CAM-ICU and FAM-CAM assessments. To be considered positive for delirium, acute change, inattention, and either disorganized thinking or altered level of consciousness are required. The features of delirium including acute change, inattention, either disorganized thinking or altered level of consciousness, and overall delirium outcomes were compared between CAM/CAM-ICU and FAM-CAM assessments. Disorganized thinking or altered level of consciousness were combined based on the scoring algorithm for the FAM-CAM [ 12 ]. Agreement between the CAM/CAM-ICU and FAM-CAM was analyzed using the Generalized Linear Mixed Model (GLMM) with repeated measures, treating patients and raters as random effects. Bland-Altman analysis was also conducted to assess agreement between CAM/CAM-ICU and FAM-CAM. Inter-rater reliability for each instrument was modeled using intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). Agreement of each delirium feature (acute onset or fluctuation, inattention, disorganized thinking/altered level of consciousness) was compared between researcher’s CAM/CAM-ICU and FAM-CAM assessment using the GLMM [ 38 ]. Overall agreement beyond chance between the two instruments was evaluated using repeated measure Cohen’s Kappa and sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predicted values. Using the research-rated CAM/CAM-ICU as the reference standard, the adjusted sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) was calculated [ 39 – 41 ]. A total of 7 FAM-CAM surveys were missing an answer to the question about inattention. There was no imputation of missing data for any item in the FAM-CAM. Data analysis was completed using SAS 9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, North Carolina) and R statistical software (3.4.2) using the ‘psych’ package.\n\nFAM-CAM after hospital discharge (Secondary objective)\n\nPatient characteristics are presented as descriptive statistics for participants with concurrent CAM/CAM-ICU and FAM-CAM surveys and patients whose family members were given a FAM-CAM booklet. Data are segregated according to whether a booklet was returned. Descriptive characteristics for patients who were positive for delirium according to FAM-CAM booklets are presented.\n\nResults\n\nPrimary objective\n\nA total of 817 patients ( Table 1 ) had at least one concurrent CAM/CAM-ICU and FAM-CAM survey completed between POD 1 through 3. In these patients, there were 1349 paired CAM/CAM-ICU and FAM-CAM assessments. Over half of the FAM-CAM assessments completed in the hospital were completed by patients’ spouses or partners ( Table 2 ). The overall postoperative delirium incidence by researchers’ ascertainment defined by at least one positive delirium assessment (CAM or CAM-ICU) in these patients was 18.8 % (154/817), while the overall detection of possible delirium symptoms by the FAM-CAM survey defined by at least one positive FAM-CAM was 22.4 % (183/817). The sensitivity and specificity comparing the FAM-CAM with the researchers’ assessments (CAM/CAM-ICU) was 53.3 % (95 % CI =0.45 to 0.61) and 87.8 % (95 % CI =0.86 to 0.90) with a PPV of 35.5 % (95 % CI =0.29 to 0.42) and a NPV of 93.8 % (95 % CI =0.93 to 0.95). According to the GLMM model, there was a significant difference in overall agreement in delirium outcome between concurrent paired CAM/CAM-ICU and FAM-CAM assessments ( p = 0.0100) ( Supplement 1 ). An observed agreement beyond chance of 79.7 % with a kappa of 0.33 between the assessments was found, with FAM-CAM being more likely to report a positive delirium outcome. There were also significant differences in agreement between the following delirium features: acute change ( p = 0.0158), inattention ( p ≤0.0001), and disorganized thinking/altered level of consciousness (p ≤0.0001). The sensitivity and specificity for acute change was 55.5 % (95 % CI =51.9 to 59.0) and 71.5 % (95 % CI = 67.9 to 75.1) with a PPV of 70.4 % (95 % CI =66.7 to 74.1) and a NPV of 56.7 % (95 % CI =53.2 to 60.2). The sensitivity and specificity for inattention was 26.4 % (95 % CI =22.7 to 30.0) and 88.4 % (95 % CI = 86.2 to 90.7) with a PPV of 62.3 % (95 % CI =56.2 to 68.5) and a NPV of 62.3 % (95 % CI =59.4 to 65.1). The sensitivity and specificity for disorganized thinking/altered level of consciousness was 83.6 % (95 % CI =78.1 to 89.2) and 53.3 % (95 % CI = 50.5 to 56.2) with a PPV of 20.6 % (95 % CI =17.9 to 23.7) and a NPV of 95.7 % (95 % CI =94.2 to 97.3). Testing the modeled intraclass correlation, both methods found raters had an excellent degree of agreement (CAM ICC = 0.938, FAM-CAM ICC = 0.985). Bland Altman analysis indicated the probability of a positive FAM-CAM was greater than the researchers’ assessment ( Fig. 1 ). Overall delirium determination by CAM/CAM-ICU and FAM-CAM indicated good agreement beyond chance by repeated measures Cohen’s Kappa (0.72 [95 % CI = 0.63 to 0.81]). Cohen’s kappa for agreement beyond chance for individual features were 0.47 (95 % CI = 0.42 to 0.52) for acute change, 0.07 (95 % CI = 0.04 to 0.10) for inattention and 0.14 (95 % CI = 0.10 to 0.17) for disorganized thinking/altered level of consciousness. Adjusted sensitivity and specificity took into consideration the bias induced by an imperfect gold standard using previously published sensitivities and specificities of each measure [ 42 , 43 ]. The pooled sensitivities and specificity for CAM/CAM-ICU were 82 % [95 % CI = 0.69 to 0.91] and 99 % [95 % CI = 0.87 to 1.00]. Under the conditionally independent assumption, the adjusted specificity of FAM-CAM was 60 %, and the adjusted specificity was 85 %. The PPV was 57 % [95 % CI =0.48 to 0.66), and the NPV was 84 % [95 % CI = 0.81 to 0.86].\n\nSecondary objective\n\nOf the family members of 330 patients, 130 (39.4 %) returned a booklet with at least one day complete. Baseline characteristics of patients whose families returned a booklet compared to non-responders are presented in Table 3 . The majority of patients whose family members returned a booklet were male, Caucasian and had at least a high school degree or equivalent, or a higher level of education. A total of 18 patients had a positive FAM-CAM at least once between hospital discharge and 30 days postoperatively. Out of these, 9 (50 %) had postoperative delirium according to CAM, CAM-ICU, or delirium chart review assessments during their hospital stay ( Fig. 2 ). Baseline characteristics of the patients who were positive for delirium after discharge compared to patients who were negative are presented in Table 4 .\n\nDiscussion\n\nThe main finding of this study is that family members can use the FAM-CAM assessment to identify symptoms of delirium, with results showing acceptable agreement with the CAM or CAM-ICU assessments, a finding also supported previously [ 20 ]. These results suggest that the FAM-CAM, designed to enhance early recognition of delirium symptoms, is a practical tool for non-clinicians to use in the postoperative period. It can aid in the detection of delirium symptoms after major surgery in order to effectively supplement the CAM/CAM-ICU and ensure timely medical intervention. This study also raises the possibility that surgical patients may be experiencing delirium after hospital discharge, approximately half of whom were not diagnosed with postoperative delirium during their hospital stay.\n\nWhile the FAM-CAM had a higher likelihood of detecting possible delirium symptoms compared to the researchers’ assessment, the sensitivity and PPV were lower than what has been previously reported [ 14 ]. This may be due to differences in how and when assessments were conducted, the fluctuating nature of delirium, variability in how family caregivers interpret symptoms, or how well they were trained. Notably, the FAM-CAM captures behavior over a 24-h period, whereas clinical tools like the CAM or CAM-ICU rely on brief, point-in-time evaluations. This extended window may allow family members to notice subtle or transient symptoms that clinicians could miss. Despite the lower sensitivity and PPV, the specificity, NPV, and overall agreement between the FAM-CAM and the researchers’ assessments were good. This suggests that while family caregivers may over-identify symptoms, their reports are generally reliable for ruling out delirium. These findings highlight that, without a definitive gold standard for delirium diagnosis, a single assessment method may be inadequate. A combined approach using both clinical assessments and family-reported tools like the FAM-CAM may provide a more complete picture. Family caregivers who are familiar with the patient’s baseline cognitive and physical functioning, particularly those who have seen them at least once in the last month and received delirium education, may improve early detection and timely intervention after major surgery. Their involvement could also aid in identifying subsyndromal delirium [ 44 , 45 ], which may otherwise go undetected. Effective communication and collaboration between clinicians and family caregivers are likely to play a key role in improving the identification and management of postoperative delirium.\n\nOur findings suggest that delirium symptoms may also be present after hospital discharge in some surgical patients who were not identified as delirious during hospitalization. However, these results should be interpreted cautiously given the limitations in follow-up data and lack of a clinical reference standard. The different study designs may have influenced the incidence of delirium found during hospitalization. The PODCAST study assessed delirium twice a day for three days, while the ENGAGES study assessed delirium only in the afternoon for five days. Additionally, both studies were interventional trials and may have influenced delirium outcomes or caregivers’ perception of delirium, which may have influenced their reporting. Future research is needed to validate the FAM-CAM in post-discharge or home-based settings using standardized clinical assessments, to better understand the incidence and risk factors for post-discharge delirium, and to develop effective prevention and management strategies.\n\nThis study has limitations. First, there is no objective biomarker or gold standard for delirium. We did not compare the findings of the CAM and CAM-ICU separately against the FAM-CAM, as this was not feasible. Each patient was assessed with either the CAM or CAM-ICU daily, but not both. However, we and others have previously shown that the long CAM form is a reliable instrument in verbal awake patients with excellent agreement between raters while the CAM-ICU is reliable in ventilated or non-verbal patients [ 29 , 36 ]. Thus, these tools are reasonable instruments to use as a reference for other candidate assessments, as we did in this study. Second, among those participants who were accessible, many were not provided FAM-CAM booklets for the various reasons listed above. Consequently, the lack of data from this subgroup could lead to underestimation or inaccurate conclusions regarding the prevalence and relevance of delirium symptoms in the overall population. Furthermore, the inability to comprehensively report missing data for patients without concurrent researcher delirium assessments and FAM-CAM surveys, or for those not administered a FAM-CAM, may introduce selection and information bias, potentially affecting the accuracy and generalizability of the findings. Third, to maintain blinding and prevent bias in the scoring of the CAM/CAM-ICU, assessors who completed the delirium interview did not review the FAM-CAM after it was completed. Therefore, some data were missing, and family members may have misinterpreted questions when completing the FAM-CAM survey. Additionally, family caregiver demographic information was not collected, which could lead to potential bias in reporting. The family members were asked about the patient’s behavior the previous 24 h, but it is unknown how long or often the family members were with the patient before completing the assessment. No answers on the assessments were changed. However, some family members, instead of marking ‘yes’ for features like excessive drowsiness, noted in comments that they viewed such symptoms as normal for someone recovering from surgery and taking medications. This could account for some of the discrepancies between the concurrent CAM/CAM-ICU and FAM-CAM, not only in the presence of the features, but also the overall assessment. Fourth, of the 330 FAM-CAM booklets sent home, only 150 were returned, which may be influenced by both selection and responder bias. The low response rate and the absence of a gold standard clinical assessment after discharge limit any definitive conclusion that can be made regarding the proportion of individuals who may have experienced delirium post discharge. Caution should be applied when interpreting these secondary findings and future studies should be conducted using validated clinical assessments as a reference standard to assess this matter. Fifth, the FAM-CAM booklet is an adaptation of the assessment tool, where family members were only instructed on the instrument once rather than at each time point. Sixth, the home is a very different environment from the hospital setting, which may impact family member responses. Future studies should further explore reliability of the FAM-CAM completed outside of the hospital setting and incorporate item-level data collection over time to better capture and analyze how relatives’ observations of delirium symptoms change. Seventh, no delirium chart review was conducted for the PODCAST study. Although delirium was assessed twice a day, delirium is fluctuating in nature and therefore it is possible that episodes of delirium may have been missed. Lastly, dementia incidence was not formally recorded in the parent studies. While some participants may have had a history of dementia, this was likely uncommon, as all underwent cognitive screening and provided informed consent. The absence of confirmed dementia diagnosis may have influenced how delirium symptoms were perceived and reported.\n\nIn conclusion, this study demonstrates that involving family members can be practically implemented, with the understanding that clear instructions for completing the FAM-CAM are necessary to ensure optimal reporting. Family engagement could be bolstered by reaching out to family members prior to surgery and educating them on risk factors for and symptoms of delirium [ 46 , 47 ]. By early identification of delirium symptoms, family members could potentially partner with the healthcare team to enhance the ability of the team to diagnose delirium and to implement preventative strategies and safety measures to prevent known complications of postoperative delirium [ 48 ]. Future studies should clarify the incidence of postoperative delirium following discharge, validate the FAM-CAM in this setting, identify patients at highest risk, and develop strategies to prevent its negative consequences.",
