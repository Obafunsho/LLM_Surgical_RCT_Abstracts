  "full_text": "Case 1\n\nA 48-year-old female patient presented with recurrent VT despite previous endocardial ablations and taking amiodarone. She was also having gradual worsening of dyspnea, fatigue, and functional capacity. Transthoracic echocardiography showed a large LV apical aneurysm and a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 25% to 30%. Because of the significant functional limitation to which the LV aneurysm was thought to be contributing, she was referred for consideration of LV aneurysm resection. After comprehensive multidisciplinary discussion and examination of treatment options with the patient, the decision was made to proceed with surgical LV aneurysm exclusion with endoventricular patch repair (Dor procedure) in addition to ablation of the LV aneurysm.\n\nThis procedure was performed via a primary median sternotomy approach. Before starting cardiopulmonary bypass, a substrate map was performed in atrial pacing/intrinsic ventricular conducted rhythm using the EnSite Precision 3D electroanatomical mapping system and Advisor HD grid multipolar catheter (Abbott Laboratories). There were marked signal abnormalities with fractionation, low voltage, and late potentials at the apex of the aneurysm ( Figure 1 , A ). Mapping delineated the borders of abnormal substrate within the aneurysm. Mapping was performed with the chest open while the heart was beating. Sites of abnormal substrate were then marked (with a marker pen) to help guide ablation during cardioplegic arrest and ensure elimination of abnormal substrate. After mapping, cardiopulmonary bypass was commenced, and the ventricular aneurysm was opened parallel to the left anterior descending artery. The transition point between the aneurysmal wall and the normal LV wall was identified. Circumferential cryoablation was performed for 3 minutes each time ( Figure 1 , B ). Lesions were anchored to one another from the transition zone to the LV apex. Both endocardial and epicardial ablation was performed.\n\nStitches were placed circumferentially around the neck of the aneurysm in the transition between the normal myocardium and the aneurysmal wall and were reinforced with a strip of pericardium in the lateral wall. A Hemashield patch was then positioned and fixated in place using the previously placed sutures, performing a patch exclusion of the aneurysm using the Dor technique ( Figure 1 , C ). The wall of the aneurysm was then closed over the patch in 2 layers using running ETHIBOND sutures. Remapping after the surgery showed elimination of abnormal signals. Postoperatively, the patient's hemodynamics were excellent with a stroke volume of 60 mL and a LVEF of 45%. The patient recovered well and was discharged 7 days after the surgery with no major complications. She remains well at 28 months after the procedure without any recurrence of VT on amiodarone 200 mg daily, which was continued for management of atrial fibrillation.\n\nCase 2\n\nA 50-year-old man was referred for management of recurrent VT in the setting of nonischemic cardiomyopathy despite multiple endocardial and epicardial catheter ablation procedures. Ten years before his presentation, he had an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest and dual-chamber implantable cardioverter defibrillator implantation. On presentation, transthoracic echocardiography showed a LVEF of 30% to 35% and a large apical LV aneurysm with regional akinesis. Genetic testing revealed a titin (TTN) variant of uncertain significance.\n\nThe surgical procedure was overall similar to the one described in case 1. After cannulating the ascending aorta and right atrium, epicardial substrate mapping was done using the EnSite Precision 3D electroanatomical mapping system and Advisor HD grid multipolar catheter (Abbott Laboratories) ( Figure 2 , A and B ). After mapping, cardiopulmonary bypass was initiated. The aneurysm was opened parallel to the left anterior descending artery. An apical thrombus was identified and removed ( Figure 2 , C ). Circumferential epicardial and endocardial cryoablation was then performed from the transition zone identified with substrate mapping to the apex of the LV ( Figure 2 , D ). Each application was delivered over 3 minutes. Stitches were then placed at the transition zone, downsizing the neck of the aneurysm. The stitches were then passed through a Hemashield patch and tied ( Figure 2 , E ). The apical wall of the ventricle was then closed with running horizontal mattress of ETHIBOND sutures. Remapping after the surgery showed elimination of abnormal signals. Postoperatively, the LVEF improved to 45%. The patient was discharged 7 days after the surgery with no major complications. He remains well at 18 months after the procedure without any recurrence of VT off antiarrhythmic drug therapy.\n\nDiscussion\n\nThe treatment of drug-resistant recurrent VT has progressed significantly in recent decades, with both catheter ablation and surgical interventions playing important roles in management. Recognizing the complementary benefits of both surgical and catheter-based approaches, clinicians and proceduralists began to use a combination of these methods to address refractory VT in the setting of LV aneurysms more effectively. This integrated approach aims to target both the structural abnormalities of the ventricle and the arrhythmogenic foci underlying VT, thereby reducing the risk of VT recurrence and improving patient outcomes.\n\nThe Dor procedure was developed for surgical ventricular restoration in patients with postinfarction LV aneurysms. 1 The procedure excludes akinetic or dyskinetic portions of the LV, reshapes the LV with a stitch that encircles the transitional zone between normal myocardium and aneurysmal tissue, and creates a new apex using a patch. 1 The goal of the Dor procedure is to reduce the LV size and wall tension. 1 This procedure was also shown to be an effective treatment for VT, 2 with a favorable impact on survival reported. 3 However, some patients remain at risk for VT after surgical ventricular restoration, particularly those with a severely enlarged LV. 4 In 2019, van Huls van Taxis and colleagues 5 reported the outcomes of a randomized study assessing the effectiveness of adding endocardial cryoablation alone versus combined endocardial and epicardial cryoablation in isolating the aneurysmal scar. Results of the trial were negative, and the trial was terminated early because of high rates of VT recurrence in both groups. 5 One of the main limitations of this trial, however, was the lack of mapping or imaging guidance for scar identification. E1\n\nIn this case series, we report cases of refractory LV aneurysm-related VT that were successfully managed with the Dor procedure combined with intraoperative substrate mapping and ablation for successful anatomical as well as electrical exclusion of the aneurysm. Intraoperatively, the adjunctive catheter-based substrate mapping has been perceived by our surgeons as a great aid for the delineation and substrate characterization of the aneurysm borders. This allowed restricting ablation to areas of abnormalities while sparing normal areas, which is particularly beneficial in patients who may be at risk for having limited cardiac reserve. In addition, mapping was done over a short period of time without compromising the surgical workflow. The addition of intraoperative substrate mapping to the Dor procedure was not reported before and appeared to have favorable acute and long-term outcomes in the cases we had. Although intraoperative substrate mapping may be considered beneficial on the basis of our experience, the impact of the Dor procedure on the risk of ventricular arrhythmias remains complex and dependent on the surgical technique. While removing myocardial scar may reduce the risk of ventricular arrhythmias, the resulting ventriculotomy scar can introduce new proarrhythmic substrates. E2\n\nConclusions\n\nThe present case series describes our outcomes with using the Dor procedure combined with intraoperative substrate mapping and ablation in patients with LV aneurysms and ischemic as well as nonischemic VT. It also highlights the importance of a multidisciplinary approach in managing these high-risk patients.\n\nConflict of Interest Statement\n\nDisclosures: The authors reported no conflicts of interest.\n\nThe Journal policy requires editors and reviewers to disclose conflicts of interest and to decline handling or reviewing manuscripts for which they may have a conflict of interest.
