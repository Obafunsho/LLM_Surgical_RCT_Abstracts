Being a vulnerable age group, there is still much apprehension regarding early hydration or feeds due to fear of vomiting, aspiration, respiratory distress or hypoxia.[ 2 6 ] Recent studies have established the safety of early postoperative hydration in terms of the incidence of nausea, vomiting, respiratory insufficiency, and thirst satisfaction scores in older children.[ 1 2 3 ] There is a lack of such data in younger children who are unable to convey thirst or hunger satisfaction. Studies have used the Face, Legs, Activity, Cry, Consolability (FLACC) score to guide the timing of oral hydration but not as an outcome.[ 3 6 ]\n\nThe primary objective of this study was to compare the FLACC score as a surrogate for patient satisfaction in younger children between those who received early versus delayed postoperative oral hydration. The secondary objectives were to compare the incidence of complications, perioperative clinical parameters and parental satisfaction. The hypothesis was that children who are given early oral hydration will have a lower postoperative FLACC score.\n\nMETHODS\n\nA single-blind, parallel-arm, randomised controlled trial was conducted between June 2023 and July 2023 after ethical approval was obtained (All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Rishikesh Institutional Ethics Committee, vide approval number AIIMS/IEC/22/260 dated 27.05.2022). The trial was registered prospectively at the Clinical Trials Registry-India (vide CTRI/2022/06/043291 dated 15.06.2022, available at https://www.ctri.nic ). After obtaining written and informed consent from parents along with permission to use the data for educational and research purposes, patients meeting the inclusion criteria and scheduled for surgeries under general anaesthesia were enrolled in the study. Inclusion criteria were children aged 1–5 years of both genders, of American Society of Anaesthesiologists physical status I–II and undergoing elective surgery under general anaesthesia. Exclusion criteria were preoperative upper respiratory tract infections, maxillofacial, oropharyngeal, thoracic, gastrointestinal, neuro and laryngeal surgeries, altered mental status, dysphagia and parental refusal for participation. The study was conducted in the operation theatre post-anaesthesia care unit (PACU) and wards of a tertiary care centre. The research was conducted following the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki (2013) and Good Clinical Practice guidelines. The manuscript follows the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) guidelines.\n\nRandomisation and allocation concealment were done using serially numbered, sealed, opaque envelopes concealing the randomisation group, which was determined by a computer-generated, simple random number sequence (allocation ratio of 1:1) and prepared by the primary investigator using the online software random.org (Randomness and Integrity Services Ltd., Dublin, Ireland). This was a single-blind study. The physician or medical professional assessing outcomes was blinded to the intervention given. The enroled patients were randomly allocated into two groups: Group EH received early hydration and Group SH received delayed standard hydration. For all patients enroled in the study, a complete preoperative assessment was done, and parents/caregivers were informed of the study protocols and all possible complications associated with early oral hydration, such as nausea and vomiting, as well as measures to manage them.\n\nOn the day of surgery, nil per oral period and consent for surgery and anaesthesia were confirmed in the preoperative room. Fasting instructions were 6 h for solids/formula milk, 4 h for breast milk and 1 h for clear liquids (up to 5 ml/kg as per the child’s demand).[ 7 8 ] Premedication was given in the form of oral midazolam 0.5 mg/kg 30–40 min before arrival in the operation room (OR). In the OR, all standard monitors (automatic blood pressure measurement, five-lead electrocardiogram, finger pulse oximetry) were attached. In children with no intravenous (IV) access, inhalational induction was done with 8% sevoflurane and oxygen, following which the IV access was secured, and IV fentanyl was given (2 µg/kg). In children with IV access, fentanyl (2 µg/kg) and propofol (2 mg/kg) were administered for anaesthesia induction. Tracheal intubation or insertion of a supraglottic airway device was performed according to the duration and type of surgery, and the patient was put on mechanical ventilation. The use of IV atracurium was also based on the type and duration of surgery. Regional nerve blocks were given according to surgical indication wherever feasible. Dexamethasone 0.15 mg/kg IV was given after anaesthesia induction in those children where the postoperative vomiting in children (POVOC) score was more than or equal to 3.[ 9 10 ] Anaesthesia was maintained with sevoflurane in oxygen and air to achieve a minimum alveolar concentration of 0.8–1. IV Ringer’s lactate (RL) at 10–20 ml/kg/h was administered. Losses were replaced with RL or blood as per indication.\n\nAround half an hour before the conclusion of the surgery, paracetamol 15 mg/kg IV and ondansetron 0.1 mg/kg IV were given. The airway device was removed after appropriate clinical and neuromuscular recovery as applicable. After surgery was completed, patients were transferred to PACU. The FLACC score, along with other clinical parameters such as heart rate (HR), respiratory rate (RR) and oxygen saturation (SpO 2 ) were measured on arrival to PACU (within 5 min of arrival) by the blinded outcome assessor.\n\nThe sealed envelope was then opened by the PACU nurse/physician involved in administering the intervention, to ascertain group allocation. In Group EH, the patient was assessed based on the Modified Aldrete scoring system, which is used post-anaesthesia to detect complications as well as to guide exit or discharge from PACU.[ 11 ] If the score was more than or equal to 9 and the patient had normal swallowing and cough reflex, vocalisation and stable vitals, hydration was given within 30 min of arrival to PACU. In Group SH , hydration was given after 2 h or more (in the parent department ward) as per the protocols of the primary surgical team. Fentanyl IV 0.5 µg/kg was given if the FLACC score was more than or equal to 6 in either of the groups at any time during the stay in PACU (preferably after attempting to give hydration in Group EH).\n\nFor fluid administration in PACU, a trained medical professional measured the quantity of fluid to be given (up to 5 ml/kg of 5% dextrose water) to the patient in any utensil like a spoon, bowl or sipper the patient was comfortable with and was accustomed to at home.[ 2 3 ] This was administered by the parent in the presence of the medical professional. A maximum of two attempts were made to feed the child within a gap of 5–10-min. Those children who refused to accept dextrose water were offered breast milk if they were breastfeeding. If even that was rejected, then these were excluded from the analysis and were given fluids per oral later/IV fluids if indicated. Patients were observed for any complications till the end of their stay in PACU and in the ward. After 1 h of arrival at PACU, the FLACC score and other clinical parameters (HR, RR, SpO 2 ) were measured again by the blinded outcome assessor. Parents were asked for their satisfaction on a Likert scale of 1–5, in which 1 signified the worst satisfaction and 5 signified the best satisfaction in terms of the child’s condition and status postoperatively. Postoperative vomiting was managed by rescue doses of IV ondansetron or any other second-line antiemetic as per departmental protocol by the primary anaesthesia team. Aspiration or hypoxia, if it occurred, was documented and managed according to standard institutional protocols. After surgery, if enteral nutrition was not initiated after shifting out of PACU, RL was given according to the 2–1–0.5 rule for 12 h or till oral feed started.\n\nAge, gender, weight, total opioid requirement, airway device used, type of surgery, POVOC score and postoperative rescue opioid requirement (FLACC score ≥6) were recorded. The primary outcome was the FLACC score at 1 h of PACU stay. The FLACC scale is a way of quantifying postoperative pain in younger paediatric patients and assessing their discomfort using behavioural parameters. Here, this was used as a surrogate marker for hunger/thirst, while the pain aspect was taken care of by standardised perioperative analgesic techniques, including regional nerve blocks, across the two groups. Secondary outcomes were parental satisfaction after 1 h of PACU stay, clinical parameters such as HR, RR and SpO 2 (pre-incision baseline, on arrival to PACU and after 1 h of PACU stay) and incidence of complications such as vomiting, hypoxia (SpO 2 <90%) or any other unanticipated adverse event during the postoperative period in PACU and later in the ward.\n\nThe sample size was calculated using the software G power version 3.1.9.4 (Heinrich-Heine-University Düsseldorf, Düsseldorf, Germany). Based on a previous study conducted by Kim et al .,[ 12 ] the mean FLACC score was 4.7 postoperatively in paediatric patients undergoing surgery under anaesthesia, with a standard deviation (SD) of 2.47. To detect a decrease in FLACC score of 2 (effect size 0.8) in the early hydration group, we would require 29 patients in each group with 5% alpha error and 85% power with an allocation ratio of 1:1 (two-tailed) based on a superiority design. Adding 15% dropouts and exclusions, we required 33 patients in each group.\n\nData was recorded in an Excel spreadsheet (MS Office Home, 2019). InStat version 3.05 (GraphPad Inc., Boston, MA, USA) was used for data analysis. Numerical data was expressed as mean (SD) if normally distributed and analysed using the unpaired Student’s t -test (age, weight, fentanyl dose, duration of surgery, HR, RR and SpO 2 ), and expressed as median (interquartile range) and analysed using the Mann–Whitney U test if non-parametric (FLACC score, parent satisfaction score and POVOC score). Categorical data was presented as numbers/frequency and compared using the Fisher’s exact test (complications, gender, regional blocks given, airway device, opioid requirement and type of surgery). P value < 0.05 was considered significant.\n\nRESULTS\n\nA total of 75 children were assessed for eligibility to participate in the study between June 2022 and July 2023, out of which 66 were randomised and 61 were considered in the final analysis. Three patients in Group EH refused early hydration and were excluded [ Figure 1 ]. Demographic data was similar in both groups [ Table 1 ]. Intraoperative parameters, including total fentanyl given, regional block, type of airway device, duration and type of surgery, median POVOC score and requirement of rescue fentanyl dose postoperatively, were also similar in both groups [ Table 1 ]. Baseline clinical parameters on arrival and after 1 h of PACU stay were comparable [ Table 2 ].\n\nThe median FLACC score was comparable on arrival to PACU. Scores after 1 h were significantly lower in Group EH [1 (0.25-2)] versus Group SH [2 (1-3)]. The median absolute decrease in score was also more in Group EH [4 (3-5)] versus Group SH [3 (2-4)] ( P = 0.028). In the subgroup analysis of cases in which no rescue doses of fentanyl were given, Group EH had a lower median FLACC score after 1 h [1 (0.75-2)] versus [2 (1-2.5)] in Group SH [ Figure 2 ].\n\nMedian parental satisfaction (Likert scale 1–5) was higher in Group EH [5 (4-5)] versus Group SH [4 (4-4)] ( P < 0.001). One patient in Group SH needed prophylactic supplemental oxygen in PACU for 10–15 min (due to mild laryngospasm at recovery). There were no other complications.\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nEarly postoperative hydration in paediatric patients undergoing general anaesthesia led to lower FLACC scores compared to standard delayed hydration in the ward. Parental satisfaction scores were higher in the early hydration group, and there were no significant complications in either group.\n\nStudies conducted on early resumption of oral fluids among older children have found lower thirst scores and incidence of thirst, supporting the findings of the current study.[ 1 2 ] These studies analysed outcomes in children above 5 years of age who could understand and convey thirst in contrast to the current study, where a behavioural score was used as a surrogate for thirst satisfaction in younger children less than 5 years of age. Earlier oral hydration should logically lead to better child satisfaction and an earlier return to baseline physiological state by improving circulation and reducing inflammation, which may also hasten the process of surgical healing. In addition, the effects of airway intervention during anaesthesia, such as dryness and irritation, may also be soothed by oral fluid intake.[ 1 ] The requirement for postoperative opioids has also been found to be lesser in children who were given early oral hydration, as lower FLACC scores due to early hydration will decrease postoperative opioid use.[ 3 6 ]\n\nIn the current study, there were no major complications, like vomiting, hypoxaemia, etc., related to the oral intake observed in either of the groups. The incidence of these complications has been observed to be around 0.1%–0.7% in previous studies, which have similarly found no significant difference in the incidence of nausea (older children), vomiting and respiratory complications in early versus delayed oral hydration.[ 1 2 ] In addition, some studies have shown a decrease in the incidence of postoperative vomiting in those children who were given early oral hydration postoperatively, which supports the positive effect of early oral intake in such children.[ 3 6 ]\n\nIn the current study, parents of Group EH had a higher satisfaction rating than those of Group SH. Parents tend to be extremely sensitive to the needs of a child, especially an ailing one, and even a small improvement in the child’s satisfaction, as well as just the physical act of returning to normalcy after surgery, may significantly improve their perception of the care given.[ 13 ]\n\nIn a similar study, Chauvin et al .[ 6 ] found that around 30% of children who were offered oral hydration refused it, while in the current study, only 9% of children refused oral hydration postoperatively. This was perhaps because in the former, children were offered apple juice by medical personnel rather than by parents, and it was only offered to those children whose FLACC score was ≥4. In the latter, all children of the study group (irrespective of their FLACC score) were offered dextrose water (which might be more palatable). As the reason for oral intake refusal postoperatively can be multifactorial, children should be offered but not forced to drink, with the intent to create a conducive environment (including adequate analgesia) for increasing the probability of the child accepting oral hydration. Interestingly, one study by Mercan et al .[ 4 ] found oral fluids given at body temperature to be more beneficial than the ones given at room temperature, when giving early feeds 1 h postoperatively.\n\nThe limitations of the current study were that the results may apply only to a specific group of surgeries and to those children who accept hydration in PACU. Alternate strategies may have to be used for those who refuse oral hydration. In addition, the age range of children in the reference study (3–10 years) for sample size calculation was not exactly similar to the current study, but was the closest available. Twenty-four-hour postoperative opioid consumption could also have been measured, which was not feasible in the current study. The strength and novelty of the current study was that it assessed thirst satisfaction in a younger group of relatively preverbal patients who received early hydration post-elective surgery.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nIn preverbal and younger children undergoing elective surgery under general anaesthesia, for non-complex surgeries with no surgical indication of postoperative fasting, early resumption of enteral hydration within half an hour of PACU arrival has better patient satisfaction in terms of a lower FLACC score and better parental satisfaction compared to those children who resume hydration later in the wards.\n\nStudy data availability\n\nDe-identified data may be requested with reasonable justification from the authors (email to the corresponding author) and shall be shared after approval as per the authors’ institution policy.\n\nConflicts of interest\n\nThere are no conflicts of interest.\n\nPresentation at a meeting : Study data was presented at the World Congress of Anaesthesiologists, Singapore, March 2024.",
