  "title": "Movin and Bonar Scores Assess the Same Characteristics of Tendon Histology",
  "abstract": "The Movin scoring system and its validated modifications and the Bonar scoring system are used to classify the histopathological findings of tendinopathy. We compared the reliability of these two different histopathological evaluation scores of tendon tissue. Tendon samples were harvested from 88 individuals (49 men, 39 women; mean age, 58.2 years) who underwent arthroscopic repair of a rotator cuff tear, and from five male patients who died of cardiovascular events (mean age, 69.6 years). A piece of supraspinatus tendon that was not directly involved in the tear was harvested en bloc within the intact middle portion of the tendon. Using hematoxylin and eosin staining and Alcian blue, slides were assessed using Bonar and Movin scores. The intraclass correlation was 0.921 (confidence interval 95% 0.790–0.963). Movin’s and Bonar’s scores have a high correlation and assess similar characteristics and variables of tendon abnormalities.",
