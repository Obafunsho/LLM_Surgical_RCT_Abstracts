  "title": "Incidence and Cost Burden of Post-Thrombotic Syndrome",
  "abstract": "Post-thrombotic syndrome (PTS) is a long-term complication of deep-vein thrombosis (DVT), manifesting as swelling, pain, edema, venous ectasia, and skin induration of the affected limb. PTS has been estimated to affect 23–60% of individuals with DVT, frequently occurring within 2 years of the DVT episode. Symptomatic DVT, post-operative asymptomatic DVT, and recurrent DVT are all risk factors for the development of PTS. Treatment of PTS is often ineffective and treatment-related costs represent a healthcare burden. Therefore, prevention of DVT is essential to reduce PTS, and thus improve outcomes and reduce overall healthcare costs. Although recommended by guidelines, appropriate DVT prophylaxis remains considerably underused. This review evaluates the incidence, risk factors, and economic impact of PTS. Increasing the awareness of PTS, and the methods to prevent this complication may help reduce its incidence, improve long-term outcomes in patients, and decrease resulting costs associated with treatment.",
