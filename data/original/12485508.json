  "full_text": "Introduction\n\nSurgical risk plays an important role in clinical decision-making for patients with severe aortic stenosis (AS). Surgical risk is commonly assessed using the Society of Thoracic Surgeons Predicted Risk of Mortality (STS-PROM) score, a model designed to estimate perioperative mortality in patients undergoing cardiothoracic procedures. 1 Although calibrated for surgical patients, the STS score has also served as an important framework for stratifying transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) patients. In 2011, TAVR was first introduced for patients at prohibitively high surgical risk based on an STS-PROM >10%, 2 with a subsequent series of pivotal trials in the past decade opening the procedure to an increasingly low risk (STS-PROM <4%) patient population. 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7\n\nImportantly, stroke remains a serious complication of TAVR that occurs in 2% to 8% of patients at 30 days. The rate of stroke has remained relatively stable over time in the TVT registry (change of 0.3% from 2011-2019) despite expanding treatment to lower-risk patients and refinements in valve protheses and implantation systems. 8 , 9 Acute brain injury (ABI) detected by diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI) affects the majority of patients following TAVR, ranging from 75% to 100% of patients, and we have previously demonstrated that a greater burden of ABI is associated with clinical stroke. 10 , 11 Efforts to identify patient or anatomy-related factors that predict stroke remain challenging, and whether surgical mortality risk is associated with stroke or ABI is unknown but clinically relevant to inform: (1) the increasing number of low/intermediate risk patients undergoing TAVR, and (2) whether selective cerebral embolic protection (CEP) use can target patients at highest stroke risk in a more economically justifiable manner. 12 To address this question, we performed a patient-level pooled analysis to investigate the relationships between STS score and stroke, ABI, and cognitive impairment following TAVR.\n\nMaterials and methods\n\nStudy population\n\nPatient-level data were pooled from 4 prospective trials 13 including DEFLECT III ( NCT02070731 ), 14 NeuroTAVR ( NCT02073864 ), 15 REFLECT I ( NCT02536196 ), 16 and REFLECT II ( NCT02536196 ) 17 ( Supplemental Table S1 ). Clinical evaluation by a neurologist coupled with DW-MRI provides the highest level of sensitivity and accuracy in the assessment of brain injury and stroke. As such, all studies included patients undergoing TAVR for severe symptomatic AS with a protocol-mandated predischarge DW-MRI (4 ± 2 days postprocedure), with serial cognitive and neurological assessments using shared methods and a common core laboratory. The population included patients with baseline STS scores. Patients were stratified based on their STS-PROM score into low risk (<4%), intermediate risk (4%-8%), and high risk (>8%) groups. As the intent of this analysis was to assess the impact of STS on stroke and brain injury prediction, an analysis based on randomized CEP treatment allocation was not performed.\n\nProcedure and evaluations\n\nAll enrolled patients received a commercially available valve and were recommended to receive standard dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel through 6 months. Neurological and cognitive assessments were performed by a board-certified neurologist at baseline, postprocedure (predischarge or 2-5 days after TAVR), 30 days, and at 90 days. Cognitive assessments included the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). 18 Neurological assessments included the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale 19 and the modified Rankin scale. 20 All studies were conducted in compliance with their protocol, United States Food and Drug Administration regulations, International Council for Harmonization Good Clinical Practice guidelines, and the Declaration of Helsinki. All patients provided written informed consent before any study-specific procedures or assessments. The protocols were approved by the applicable institutional review boards at each center prior to subject enrollment.\n\nImaging methods\n\nAll DW-MRI were acquired using a standard acquisition protocol and analyzed at a single core laboratory (Buffalo Neuroimaging Analysis Center) using standardized methods and blinded to clinical outcomes. DW-MRI were acquired using 1.5 or 3.0 Tesla systems, 4 ± 2 days after TAVR, and included a 2D echo planar sequence with one b = 0 image and 3 orthogonal diffusion directions with b = 1000 s/mm 2 . T2-fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) images were acquired with a 2D spin-echo inversion recovery sequence. The b = 0 and 3 orthogonal diffusion-encoded raw images were combined to create trace and apparent diffusivity coefficient (ADC) images. All within-subject DW-MRI scans were coregistered to T2-FLAIR images using Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging of the Brain’s Linear Image Registration Tool with 6 degrees of freedom. 21 Corrected T2-FLAIR and DW-MRI trace images were standardized by applying a piecewise linear histogram adjustment method to compensate for scan-to-scan variability in absolute intensity. 22 Lesions were delineated on corrected and aligned DW-MRI trace images and T2-FLAIR images using a semiautomated contouring technique provided by the Java Image Manipulation software package, with simultaneous reference to the ADC and T2-FLAIR images, as previously reported. 16 , 17 , 23 , 24 A trained operator identified each lesion individually and delineated the iso-contour at the maximum local gradient using an automated algorithm. The operator viewed all images simultaneously to confirm hypointensity on ADC maps. T2-FLAIR lesions were restricted to those that were not simultaneously DW-MRI positive to quantify a proxy for preprocedural lesion burden on postprocedural images. DW-MRI measures included the number of lesions, the volume of individual lesions, and the total volume of all lesions.\n\nStatistical methods\n\nIn general, binary baseline and outcome variables are summarized with frequencies and percentages, and pairwise group differences are compared with the Fisher exact test. Continuous variables are summarized using means and standard deviations when normality cannot be ruled out, and pairwise groups are compared with t test. For MRI data, where the data are skewed, both means and standard deviations, as well as medians and interquartile ranges with minimum and maximum values, are presented to fully describe the distribution of the data. The nonparametric Wilcoxon rank sum test is used to compare pairwise groups in this case.\n\nResults\n\nA total of 603 patients were pooled from the 4 studies, of which 537 (89%) met inclusion criteria with an STS score at baseline. The mean STS score was 5.2 ± 3.6, of which 47% were low risk, 37% were intermediate risk, and 16% were high risk (including 3.2% extreme risk [STS >14]) ( Figure 1 ). Differences in baseline patient characteristics between STS groups are summarized in Table 1 . Hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, peripheral vascular disease, prior stroke, TIA, and procedural characteristics were similar between the 3 groups, with the exception of more balloon inflations required in the intermediate and high risk groups. Self-expanding valves were more commonly used in the high risk group ( P = .002), whereas balloon-expandable valves were more commonly used in the low risk group ( P = .005).\n\nAt 30 days, the high risk group had a mortality rate of 6.1% compared with 0.8% in the low risk group ( Table 2 ). High risk patients had higher rates of acute kidney injury, bleeding, and major vascular complications compared to lower-risk patients. There were no significant differences in overall stroke, disabling stroke, or patients with complete stroke recovery between STS groups. The high risk group had an overall stroke rate of 11.3% compared with 7.4% in the intermediate and 7.0% in the low risk group ( P = NS). The mean STS score among patients with vs without stroke was similar (5.9 vs 5.1; P = .19). Baseline cognitive function based on MoCA scores was higher in the low STS risk group, and low and intermediate STS risk groups followed similar trajectories with improvement through 90 days; this was not seen in the high STS risk group ( Figure 2 and Supplemental Table S2 ).\n\nAcute cerebral ischemia on DW-MRI was assessable in 495 of 603 (82%) patients, of which 445 of 495 (90%) had available STS scores. Patients without DW-MRI had higher body mass index, less congestive heart failure, were more likely to receive general anesthesia, but had less rapid pacing, and STS scores were similar for patients with and without DW-MRI (5.2 vs 5.4; P = .56) ( Supplemental Table S3 ). There were no significant differences in total lesion number, individual lesion volume, and total lesion volume between STS risk groups ( Table 3 ). The presence of any lesions above varying volume thresholds was not different between groups ( Central Illustration ).\n\nDiscussion\n\nThis patient-level pooled analysis adds to our understanding of the role of the STS-PROM in risk-stratifying patients undergoing TAVR. Our study confirms that STS-defined surgical risk predicts, but overestimates, 30-day mortality following TAVR, and predicts the risk of acute kidney injury, bleeding, and major vascular complications. However, STS does not predict the risk of stroke or ABI following TAVR.\n\nOur study demonstrates that the potential for stroke and brain injury affects all patients after TAVR, irrespective of STS risk; specifically, stroke and ABI risk are distinct from mortality risk, and they extend equally to otherwise lower comorbid patients. This is further supported by the fact that there has been little progress in curbing the risk of stroke following TAVR, whereas mortality rates have declined over time. 8 Together, this observation emphasizes the embolic mechanism underpinning TAVR-related stroke and cerebral injury and the need to focus preventive measures on procedure-related factors to mitigate stroke and embolic risk. Significant work has been undertaken to investigate the role of CEP devices designed to reduce embolic injury, but results have been inconclusive to date. In the PROTECTED-TAVR and the BHF PROTECT TAVI trials, the SENTINEL Cerebral Protection System (Boston Scientific) did not reduce periprocedural stroke, 9 , 25 nor did SENTINEL reduce DW-MRI infarct volume in its approval trial. 23 PROTECTED-TAVR did report a small but statistically significant reduction in disabling stroke, a secondary end point. Similarly, a recent STS/ACC TVT registry study showed a modest but significant reduction in disabling stroke with SENTINEL, without significant interaction when stratified by STS risk, suggesting a similar benefit of CEP across the spectrum of patient risk. 26 We will gain further insights on the role of SENTINEL, if any, in reducing disabling stroke in the upcoming patient-level pooled analysis of the PROTECTED-TAVR and the BHF PROTECT TAVI trials.\n\nEfforts to identify patients at increased risk of stroke or ABI after TAVR are ongoing, aiming for a more targeted (and cost effective) selection of TAVR patients for CEP therapy. The only predictor of disabling stroke identified in the STS/ACC TVT registry was a prior history of stroke. Although patients with prior stroke may derive greater benefit from CEP, there is currently no evidence supporting selective CEP use, as the risk of stroke and ABI appears to be universal across risk strata based on our study results, and the treatment effect of CEP appears to be independent of operative risk in the TVT analysis. Instead, efforts should continue to focus on overcoming the current limitations of first-generation CEP toward safe and effective embolic projection devices.\n\nWith the growing number of lower-risk and potentially younger patients opting for TAVR, our ability to predict and prevent stroke remains a priority. The low frequency and random nature of acute clinical stroke and brain injury after TAVR present a significant challenge in evaluating predictive factors and preventive strategies. In this respect, due to the rigorous neurologic assessments mandated in the trials contributing to our pooled analysis, the observed stroke rate (8%) in our study was higher than that reported in registries (2.5%). Nevertheless, the absolute number of stroke events remained low (40 events), potentially limiting our ability to detect clinically meaningful differences between STS groups. However, 85.5% of patients had evidence of new ischemic brain lesions on DW-MRI, whose size and number are associated with clinical stroke. 13 This analysis of ABI provides greater precision and confidence in confirming the absence of association between STS risk and acute infarct burden following TAVR.\n\nPrevious studies have evaluated the role of the STS and TVT risk scores in predicting stroke. Al-Azizi et al 27 recently compared the performance of the STS score and TVT score in a series of 3270 consecutive patients and found neither score predicted stroke (STS, 0.65 [0.62-0.58]). Our study is consistent with these findings and supports the notion that surgical risk is unlikely to be associated with stroke risk, but extends this observation by demonstrating that the STS score does not predict the difference in measures of brain injury by DW-MRI. Although no significant difference in stroke rates was observed based on STS risk, the numerically higher stroke rate in the highest STS risk group (11.3% vs 7.4% vs 7.0% in the intermediate- and low risk groups [ P = NS]) raises the question of power to detect a difference. In this context, the lack of a difference in brain injury in the highest risk group supports the lack of association.\n\nThere have been limited attempts to develop new models to predict stroke risk in TAVR patients. Thourani et al 28 developed a stroke model based on patients enrolled in the TVT registry undergoing TAVR, but the derived model was weakly predictive of stroke (c = 0.61) and limited by the low frequency (1.9%) of clinical stroke. This model did identify some features that are not included in STS, including aortic atherosclerosis, which is likely relevant to the embolic mechanism of stroke with TAVR. The upcoming pooled analysis of >10,000 randomized patients from the PROTECTED-TAVR and BHF PROTECT TAVI trials will provide further insights into predicting stroke risk.\n\nOur study also found that surgical risk is associated with differences in the cognitive trajectory of patients following TAVR. We observed a difference in baseline cognitive function using the MoCA score based on the STS score, and an improvement in the MoCA scores after TAVR in patients with low and intermediate risk that was not seen in high risk patients. It is possible that TAVR leads to improved cognitive function in some patients, as a result of enhanced cerebral hemodynamics, though improvement related to practice effects also likely plays a role. The lack of MoCA improvement in the high risk subgroup may reflect their increased age, which correlates strongly with incipient dementia, and would make them less likely to experience improvements from repeated assessments. 29 , 30 , 31\n\nOn the other hand, our study confirms that the STS score performed as intended by predicting differences in 30-day mortality based on STS strata. However, all 3 groups had consistently lower mortality rates than their respective score ranges would predict, which is in line with recent findings. 32 , 33 , 34 , 35 There are limitations to the STS risk score as it does not account for features such as frailty, liver disease, or anatomic considerations such as a hostile or porcelain aorta. Using a model calibrated by and for surgical patients has shortcomings in the context of transcatheter procedures. Lastly, another contribution of our study is demonstrating that STS can predict complications following TAVR, including acute kidney injury, bleeding, and major vascular complications. There is significant interest in augmenting risk models to improve our ability to predict outcomes, with ongoing efforts leveraging artificial intelligence. 34 , 36 , 37 , 38 , 39 Though imperfect in application for TAVR, the STS score remains an important tool in heart team discussions.\n\nLimitations\n\nOur study has several limitations. Systematic DW-MRI after TAVR is associated with an inherent high dropout rate; in our study 17% did not undergo DW-MRI, mostly due to the need for permanent pacemaker insertion. Nevertheless, this pooled analysis is the largest cohort of TAVR patients with systematic DW-MRI, and it is unlikely that this dropout rate impacted our results, given that STS scores were similar in patients with vs without MRI. In the future, small, portable DW-MRI units may help overcome the dropout rates but will require validation of acute infarct sensitivity. Imaging and the measurement of ABI has the benefit of being an objective and reproducible outcome that should play an important role in the development of the risk models of the future. Given the low frequency event rate of stroke, a larger sample size may have demonstrated more significant outcome associations. Although procedural characteristics were similar, except for more balloon inflations required in the intermediate- and high risk groups, there may be some further undetected nuance between self-expanding and balloon-expandable valves. It is also possible that subtle cognitive changes were not detected with the MoCA assessment.\n\nConclusion\n\nThis pooled analysis demonstrates that the STS score predicts a number of clinically important outcomes, including mortality, bleeding, kidney injury, and major vascular complications; however, it does not predict stroke or ABI on DW-MRI after TAVR. This observation supports the underlying embolic mechanism of stroke and ABI in the context of TAVR for calcific AS and suggests that stroke is independent of other procedural risks and affects all patients equally across the spectrum of STS risk.",
