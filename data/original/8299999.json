  "title": "The Internal Mammary Artery and its Resilience to Atherogenesis: Shifting from Risk to Resistance to Address Unmet Needs",
  "abstract": "Fuelled by the global surge in ageing, atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease reached pandemic dimensions putting affected individuals at enhanced risk of myocardial infarction, stroke and premature death. Atherosclerosis is a systemic disease driven by a wide spectrum of factors, including cholesterol, pressure and disturbed flow. Although all arterial beds encounter a similar atherogenic milieu, the development of atheromatous lesions occurs discontinuously across the vascular system. Indeed, the internal mammary artery (IMA) possesses unique biological properties that confer protection to intimal growth and atherosclerotic plaque formation, thus making it a conduit of choice for coronary artery bypass grafting. Its endothelium abundantly expresses nitric oxide (NO) synthase and shows accentuated NO release, whilst its vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) exhibit reduced tissue factor expression, high tissue-type plasminogen activator production and blunted migration and proliferation, which may collectively mitigate intimal thickening and ultimately the evolution of atheromatous plaques. We aim here to provide insights into the anatomy, physiology, cellular and molecular aspects of the IMA thereby elucidating its remarkable resistance to atherogenesis. We propose a change in perspective from risk to resilience to decipher mechanisms of atheroresistance and eventually identification of novel therapeutic targets presently not addressed by currently available remedies.",
