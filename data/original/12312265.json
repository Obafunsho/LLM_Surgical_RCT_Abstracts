  "full_text": "Background\n\nIn 1971, preliminary studies explored the prophylactic use of methylprednisolone before cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). Over the decades, numerous clinical studies, reviews, and systematic reviews have examined the benefits of corticosteroids during the perioperative period of cardiac surgery, comparing different dosages and administration schedules [ 1 – 3 ]. Currently, the impact of this intervention on clinical outcomes remains unclear [ 4 – 6 ]. Chaney et al. reviewed the relevant clinical studies, providing a historical overview of the use of corticosteroids during CPB from 1960 to 2003, and emphasized previous studies primarily focusing on inflammatory mediators [ 7 ]. To date, no studies have provided a comprehensive overview of the knowledge framework and research trends regarding corticosteroid use in the perioperative phase of cardiac surgery.\n\nBibliometric analysis represents a technique for exploring and analyzing scientific literature [ 8 ], with applications across numerous fields, including medicine [ 9 ]. This study performed a bibliometric analysis of publications addressing corticosteroid use during the perioperative phase of cardiac surgery, encompassing the period from 2000 to 2023. This analysis aims to enhance readers’ understanding of key research points and emerging trends in the field, illuminate urgent issues requiring exploration, and provide a foundation for future studies.\n\nMethods\n\nData Selection\n\nWe utilized the Web of Science Core Collection to identify publications concerning corticosteroid use during the perioperative period of cardiac surgery. Additional File 1 details the search strategy. The search encompassed publications from 2000 to October 30, 2023, including document types such as articles, proceedings papers, and early access documents. We examined titles and abstracts to select literature relevant to our research topic. Figure 1 illustrates the flowchart depicting the literature selection process.\n\nData analysis and visualization\n\nWe employed bibliometric tools to extract key information from selected articles, encompassing country, institution, author, keywords, highly cited articles, and journal data. All data records were retrieved from the Web of Science (including Science Citation Index and Social Sciences Citation Index) for subsequent analysis. To analyze and visualize these variables, we utilized Microsoft Excel 2019, VOSviewer (version 1.6.19), CiteSpace (version 6.2R4), and the biblioshiny R package. The H-index quantifies a researcher’s influence by determining how many of their publications and citations meet or exceed the threshold of h [ 10 ].\n\nResults\n\nOverall, 293 publications were selected for bibliometric analysis. Having analyzed the data, we meticulously crafted charts illustrating various types of information within that field, as shown in Fig. 2 .\n\nAnnual production\n\nAnnual Scientific Production demonstrated notable increases in 2001 with 22 publications and again in 2014 with 20 publications (Fig. 3 ). The average publication volume across most years was 12. However, in 2022, publication output declined to a low of 3, representing a significant decrease below the average annual level. We hypothesize that this phenomenon correlates closely with the developmental trajectory of the topic. During early developmental stages, numerous clinical trials employing various doses and types of corticosteroids across different centers were conducted to comprehensively investigate their safety and efficacy. As these foundational clinical trials reached completion, the number of published clinical trials has diminished in recent years. Concurrently, systematic reviews and meta-analyses on this topic have recently proliferated, seeking to comprehensively synthesize outcomes across various indicators. Given that our analysis focused on clinical trials, the recent decline in publication numbers is reflected in Fig. 3 .\n\nSource contribution\n\nWe utilized the biblioshiny R package to analyze journal data and Microsoft Excel 2019 to generate a bar chart (Fig. 4 A). The top 10 journals were identified according to their H-index, publication volume, and total citation count. The analysis revealed that journals with the highest H-index include the ANNALS OF THORACIC SURGERY (H-index: 17, 21 publications, IF: 4.6) and the JOURNAL OF CARDIOTHORACIC AND VASCULAR ANESTHESIA (H-index: 17, 26 publications, IF: 2.8). Among the top ten journals, eight originate from the United States and two from England. We employed VOSviewer to create a journal cooperation network map (Fig. 4 B). The ANNALS OF THORACIC SURGERY (H-index: 17, impact factor: 4.6) and the JOURNAL OF THORACIC AND CARDIOVASCULAR SURGERY (H-index: 11, impact factor: 6) demonstrate close connectivity, indicating substantial collaboration between these journals. Their prominent nodes in the network map signify their central role, prolific publication output, and substantial contributions to the field, establishing these journals as essential resources for researchers.\n\nInstitution distribution\n\nWe employed VOSviewer to analyze co-authorship networks among institutions, where circle size reflects centrality within the network [ 8 ]. We identified 19 institutions with publication counts exceeding five, qualifying them for inclusion. The figure in Additional File 2 displays the 10 institutions with the highest publication volumes. The distribution includes four institutions from the Netherlands, four from the United States, and one each from Finland and Canada. The University Medical Center Utrecht leads in publication volume with a total of 16 publications. Co-authorship analysis encompassed institutions with publications exceeding three. Network visualization clearly demonstrated that the University Medical Center Utrecht represents the largest node (Additional File 3 A), signifying its pivotal role in the field. The Overlay visualization’s color-coding illustrates the chronological sequence of institutional publications, with the “Medical University of South Carolina” ranking 10th in volume (Additional Files 2 and 3 B). Institutions such as “Ohio State University” and “Monash University,” while not among the top 10, have published recent articles, suggesting their potential emergence as leading research institutions.\n\nCountry contribution\n\nWe employed CiteSpace 6.2R4 and the biblioshiny R package for our analysis. Initially, we conducted a co-authorship analysis among countries (Additional File 4 A), followed by the creation of a map depicting countries of Corresponding Authors (Additional File 4 B). In analyzing national collaboration networks, node size represents each country’s publication output, while line thickness between nodes indicates collaboration intensity, though distance between nodes does not reflect collaboration strength [ 8 ]. We identified the top 10 countries based on total research publications and their centrality within the academic network (Additional File 5 ). The analysis reveals that the USA, the Netherlands, China, Germany, and Canada lead in publication output. These countries dominate the field, exerting substantial influence. The USA maintains extensive collaborations with numerous countries while leading in publication volume, with a centrality value of 0.36, compared to values of 0.14 and 0.11 for the Netherlands and Australia, respectively. Purple highlighting surrounding key nodes in these three countries indicates heightened activity [ 8 ], suggesting that research in these regions is both significant and increasingly prominent. Red shading around Germany and Iran denotes their strong research centrality [ 8 ], as these countries frequently generate foundational studies.\n\nAdditional File 4 B illustrates countries producing the most research output. The United States maintains a commanding position in this field. While multi-country publications remain relatively uncommon, the United States, Canada, and Australia lead international collaborations, contributing 10, 8, and 6 publications, respectively. Publication output demonstrates temporal variation among countries. Co-authorship analysis (Additional File 4 A) reveals that pre-2010 German publications predominantly examined corticosteroid effects on postoperative inflammatory markers, indicating Germany’s pioneering involvement in foundational research within this field.\n\nOverview of landmark articles and authors\n\nUtilizing the biblioshiny R package, we analyzed the corresponding authors of included articles and evaluated citations of the most highly cited publications. We identified the top 10 locally cited documents with their corresponding authors (Additional File 6 ). Review of these highly cited articles revealed predominant research themes for subsequent analysis. The analysis demonstrated that among highly cited authors, four originate from the United States, two from the Netherlands, and one each from Germany, Japan, Finland, and Canada. The article garnering most attention originates from the United States, authored by Backer, CL, entitled “Dexamethasone Reduces the Inflammatory Response to Cardiopulmonary Bypass in Children,” while the second-ranked article is “Intraoperative High-Dose Dexamethasone for Cardiac Surgery: A Randomized Controlled Trial.” Highly cited literature underscores the research emphasis on perioperative corticosteroid use and its impact on patients’ clinical outcomes.\n\nCo-occurrence analysis of keywords\n\nWe performed keyword co-occurrence cluster analysis of the literature, identifying four primary clusters. We analyzed keywords within these clusters and tracked their temporal progression, enabling a comprehensive overview of research focal point evolution within this field. Figure 5 A presents the network visualization, where distinct colors represent separate clusters denoting unique research topics. This analysis encompasses keyword co-occurrence analysis and network visualization. Larger node sizes indicate higher keyword frequency, reflecting stronger interest levels within clusters. Co-occurrence analysis employing overlay visualization identifies five frequently cited terms (Fig. 5 B): cardiopulmonary bypass (365 citations), cardiac surgery (233 citations), methylprednisolone (257 citations), dexamethasone (242 citations), and children (183 citations). These keywords primarily constitute four thematic clusters.\n\nCluster 1 (purple): This cluster primarily investigates physiological inflammatory responses and steroid-mediated inflammation modulation through comparative analysis of inflammatory mediators and cytokine levels between steroid-free control groups and steroid-supplemented intervention groups during the perioperative period. Most literature in this domain was published before 2010, indicating a focus on foundational research.\n\nCluster 2 (blue): Since 2010, research emphasis has transitioned from examining steroid effects on postoperative inflammatory mediators and cytokines toward clinical outcomes, including mortality, postoperative delirium, and atrial fibrillation. The impact of steroids on cardiac surgery outcomes has generated substantial research interest, encouraging researchers to adopt more “patient-centered” outcome measures. Two seminal clinical trials, the DECS trial and the SIRS trial, incorporated comprehensive clinical outcome measures [ 11 , 12 ].\n\nCluster 3 (green): This cluster primarily examines how corticosteroid dosage and administration timing affect adverse outcomes following cardiac operations. Despite numerous studies published since 2012, optimal dosage and timing for steroid administration remain incompletely understood. Current research yields inconsistent findings regarding several critical complications, including mortality, pulmonary complications, and cardiovascular complications, creating challenges for guidelines to formulate definitive recommendations. While most clinical studies administer steroids prophylactically before surgery, dosage determination relies on previous research and clinical team considerations [ 3 ]. These controversies have intensified researchers’ focus on key factors such as corticosteroid dosage and type to elucidate clinical benefits and risks. This shift reflects both a refined, comprehensive research approach and a significant directional change within the field. A meta-analysis by Kwok et al. demonstrates that low-dose and higher-dose regimens exhibit comparable effectiveness in improving clinical outcomes, with lower-dose regimens typically producing fewer adverse effects [ 13 ]. Whitlock et al. advocate a 500 mg methylprednisolone dose as optimal for balancing efficacy and safety [ 12 ]. Based on current literature findings, we compiled a preliminary summary regarding corticosteroid dosage and administration timing for prophylactic use in cardiac surgery, with comprehensive details in Additional File 7 .\n\nCluster 4 (yellow): This cluster primarily investigates corticosteroid benefits for cardiac surgery patients, emphasizing pediatric effects. Most relevant studies appeared around 2014. Figure 5 B illustrates the temporal evolution of research focus.\n\nThematic evolution\n\nFinally, we depict the evolution of research topics, as shown in Fig. 6 . The time span of the data is divided into five equal intervals. The nodes in the figure show the main research topics identified through co-occurrence network analysis for each interval. The size of the nodes in each topic corresponds to the frequency of their keywords, while streamlines illustrate how topics evolve between adjacent time slices. As research progresses, the topics initially consolidate, then disperse, and consolidate again. During the first phase (2000–2010), the main keywords included “cardiopulmonary bypass,” “glucocorticoids,” “adhesion molecules,” and “tumor necrosis factor.” During the second phase (2011–2014), clinical studies increasingly focused on reducing postoperative inflammatory responses and preventing adverse outcomes, such as acute renal failure. A growing consensus has emerged regarding the onset of systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) following CPB. This condition is associated with a continuous process of adverse clinical outcomes. The relationships among high-frequency keywords became more interconnected. This includes terms like “decrease,” “bypass,” “inflammation,” and “acute renal failure.” In the third phase (2015–2023), there was a further intensification of the research field’s focus, and previously loosely related keywords converged to create new thematic areas, with terms such as “cognitive dysfunction,” “therapy,” and “management.”\n\nDiscussion\n\nFollowing cardiac surgery, inflammatory responses manifest at varying degrees, with a reported incidence of 96.2% [ 14 ]. Corticosteroids function primarily through their potent anti-inflammatory effects, facilitating a balance between pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory functions within innate and adaptive immune systems [ 15 ]. This study utilized bibliometric analysis to assess the current research landscape spanning 23 years. Comprehensive literature review revealed that 2001 research was predominantly foundational, emphasizing intermediate, non-clinical endpoints such as serum inflammatory markers, demonstrating significant inflammation suppression [ 6 , 16 , 17 ]. Since 2010, clinical trials underwent a substantial shift toward clinical outcomes, including mortality and associated complications [ 18 ].\n\nKey term evolution analysis reveals that early research interests concentrated primarily on non-clinical endpoints. The innate immune system initiates postoperative inflammatory responses through pattern recognition receptor activation, including damage-associated molecular patterns and pathogen-associated molecular patterns. This activation triggers downstream signaling cascades, culminating in elevated inflammatory mediator, chemokine, cytokine, and immune factor levels [ 15 ]. Evidence conclusively demonstrates that corticosteroids exert substantial inhibitory effects on post-cardiac surgery inflammation [ 6 , 17 ].\n\nSubsequent research periods predominantly feature clinical prognostic indicators. SIRS-related complications following cardiac surgery may encompass respiratory dysfunction, postoperative delirium, adverse cardiac events, and acute kidney injury, among others [ 13 , 19 , 20 ]. The 2019 European Association for Cardio-Thoracic Surgery/European Association of Cardiothoracic Anaesthesiology/European Board of Cardiovascular Perfusion guidelines [ 21 ] integrated evidence from two large-scale randomized controlled trials. Despite variations in corticosteroid type and dosage, results demonstrated no statistically significant differences between corticosteroid-treated and control groups regarding primary outcome measures, including mortality and adverse event incidence encompassing cardiac, renal, and central nervous system complications. Additionally, a systematic review and meta-analysis incorporating 56 randomized controlled trials with 16,013 patients revealed that perioperative corticosteroid administration’s impact on mortality remains indeterminate, though it may increase myocardial injury risk while potentially reducing new-onset atrial fibrillation risk. Expert consensus regarding cardiopulmonary bypass indicates Grade A evidence (based on high-quality research) for prophylactic perioperative corticosteroid use, with a recommendation grade of IIB (weak recommendation) [ 22 ]. Perioperative corticosteroid application reduces postoperative myocardial injury markers; decreases infection incidence; lowers atrial fibrillation rates; shortens mechanical ventilation duration, intensive care unit stay, and total hospitalization time; and improves pulmonary function. However, corticosteroids fail to improve mortality and may increase hyperglycemia risk and insulin requirements [ 22 ]– [ 23 ]. The most recent meta-analysis demonstrates that corticosteroids modestly reduce pulmonary complication risk by 6.9%, decrease postoperative infection incidence by 10.3%, and lower new-onset postoperative atrial fibrillation frequency by 7.1%, though these conclusions derive from low-certainty evidence [ 24 ]. These findings emphasize the necessity for judicious corticosteroid utilization in clinical practice, avoiding unwarranted interventions while prioritizing individualized treatment plans to optimize patient postoperative recovery. Dieleman et al. demonstrated that dexamethasone use during cardiac surgery provides greater potential benefits for patients under 65 years than it does to those over 65 [ 11 ]. Subsequently, Myles et al. evaluated corticosteroid application in cardiac surgery patients under 75 years [ 25 ]. Kataoka et al. emphasized the need for additional neonatal research to identify patients at elevated adrenal insufficiency risk [ 26 ], while Abbasciano et al. proposed that future large-scale trials should delineate specific patient characteristics determining who may benefit from prophylactic steroid treatment without substantially increasing adverse outcome risk [ 24 ]. These targeted patient selection strategies correspond with our high-risk population concept and demonstrate strong consistency with our summarized research trends.\n\nThis analysis encompasses an extensive array of clinical trials, predominantly published before 2015. Recent years have witnessed a marked increase in systematic reviews and meta-analyses, seeking to consolidate findings from numerous high-quality clinical trials and inform clinical practice. However, definitive evidence guiding perioperative corticosteroid use remains elusive. Has the field reached a stalemate? Clinical study numbers in this area have progressively declined compared to previous years—perhaps authors recognize that conducting similar clinical trials across various centers no longer provides significant value? Conversely, recognition of individual corticosteroid response variability continues to grow. Patients developing severe SIRS post-surgery typically exhibit poorer prognoses. High-risk patients for severe SIRS likely derive greater benefit from prophylactic corticosteroid therapy, while certain low-risk patients may experience more harm than benefit from perioperative corticosteroid administration. Perioperative high-dose corticosteroid administration may be associated with specific adverse effects, including elevated blood glucose levels [ 27 ] and increased incidence of adverse cardiac events [ 28 ].\n\nThrough a comprehensive review and synthesis of high-citation impact literature, we note that Kilger et al. delineated a phenotype identifying high-risk patients susceptible to severe SIRS following surgery, who face elevated risk for multiple organ failure and mortality. Therefore, timely identification and immediate intervention remain essential for achieving favorable outcomes [ 29 ]. Addressing this high-risk population, Kilger et al. conducted clinical studies demonstrating that stress-dose hydrocortisone administration effectively reduced systemic inflammation in identified high-risk groups and enhanced early clinical outcomes, including reduced interleukin (IL)-6/IL-10 ratios [ 30 ] and decreased lactate levels. Additionally, postoperative follow-up revealed significant reductions in stress symptoms, physical dysfunction, and chronic pain, alongside marked improvements in overall health, vitality, and mental health-related quality of life [ 31 ].\n\nCurrent research demonstrates increasing refinement and must consider, first, methods for identifying patients likely to exhibit significant inflammatory dysregulation phenotypes before surgery [ 29 ]. Through predictive model development, identifying severe SIRS phenotypes anticipated postoperatively, corticosteroid efficacy in these high-risk patients can be assessed [ 29 ], the variables associated with high-risk patients are detailed in Additional File 8 . Moreover, these models can integrate into clinical research, facilitating targeted high-risk patient interventions and optimizing outcomes [ 15 ]. Through an extensive literature review and systematic analysis, we determined that high-risk patients are typically defined as those predisposed to developing severe SIRS postoperatively. Kilger et al. classified patients undergoing combined valve surgery and coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) or CABG with at least four grafts as high-risk, confirming corticosteroid benefits in this population [ 29 ]. Another significant model is the inflammation risk model utilizing C-reactive protein (CRP) response, defining high systemic inflammation as expected postoperative CRP levels exceeding 197.58 mg/L, revealing that each 1 mg/L preoperative CRP increase associates with a 7.34 mg/L postoperative peak CRP increase [ 32 ]. Additional research highlighting SIRS prediction complexity found that female sex, preoperative anemia, leukocytosis, lymphocytopenia, and thrombocytosis positively correlate with first postoperative day SIRS. Remarkably, higher preoperative glomerular filtration rates also predicted SIRS occurrence [ 33 ]. Another investigation emphasized relationships between SIRS and preoperative low creatinine clearance/low ejection fraction, as well as intraoperative surgical duration [ 34 ]. Inflammatory indices, including the blood cell count inflammation index [ 35 ] and systemic inflammation index [ 36 ], demonstrate predictive value for adverse outcomes in high-risk patients. SIRS-positive patients exhibit higher composite outcome incidence, including death, transient ischemic attack/stroke, and renal replacement therapy [ 34 ]. These findings collectively underscore SIRS’s multifactorial etiology and the critical importance of incorporating both preoperative and intraoperative variables in risk assessment. Second, determining optimal administration timing and protocols remains crucial. Despite lacking standardized corticosteroid administration protocols, our analysis identifies a prevailing practice: methylprednisolone administration initiated concurrent with CPB onset, with total dosages ranging from 500 to 3000 mg and a notable 500-mg dosage preference. Based on high-quality randomized controlled trials, systematic reviews, and meta-analyses, we propose 500 mg methylprednisolone administered preoperatively as the optimal corticosteroid regimen [ 3 , 12 ]. Third, considering marked physiological and pathological differences between adults and children, future research should separately investigate causative factors and future directions for evolving research hotspots in these populations. Therefore, based on bibliometric analysis, we project that predictive model development for high-risk patient identification, with subsequent corticosteroid effectiveness and safety evaluation in high-risk patients, will constitute a significant research area.\n\nLimitations\n\nBibliometric analyses inherently contain certain limitations. First, qualitative assessments of bibliometric outcomes may contain subjective bias. Second, bibliometric studies primarily provide short-term research trend predictions, with limited capacity for long-term hotspot trend assessment. Third, our data analysis was restricted to the Web of Science Core Collection database, excluding other databases, potentially omitting relevant literature not indexed within this database. Future analyses should expand database scope to obtain more comprehensive literature data. Furthermore, bibliometric tool limitations may introduce analytical bias—for instance, while we analyzed and referenced highly cited literature that typically reflects research academic influence and visibility, this cannot absolutely guarantee research quality. These factors collectively illuminate the nuances and limitations inherent in our bibliometric approach.\n\nConclusions\n\nWe performed a comprehensive bibliometric analysis examining literature on corticosteroid use during the cardiac surgery perioperative period, spanning 2000 to 2023. Early investigations primarily emphasized intermediate, non-clinical endpoints, demonstrating corticosteroids’ substantial inhibitory effect on postoperative inflammation following cardiac surgery. Subsequent research expanded to encompass broader clinical endpoint arrays, yet failed to generate conclusive practice guidance. Given substantial individual corticosteroid response variation, future research will likely emphasize preventive corticosteroid use for patients demonstrating the greatest benefit potential. Furthermore, developing personalized treatment regimens will remain a priority focus.\n\nElectronic supplementary material\n\nBelow is the link to the electronic supplementary material.\n\nSupplementary Material 1: Additional File 1: Search strategy.
