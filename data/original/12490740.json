  "title": "Top 100 Most-Cited Studies on MRI and Neuroplasticity in Stroke: A Scoping Review and Bibliometric Analysis of Citation Trends",
  "abstract": "Stroke is a leading cause of long-term disability worldwide. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has become central to understanding neuroplasticity-the brain’s capacity to reorganize after injury-by providing insights into structural and functional changes during recovery. Despite its importance, the intellectual and conceptual foundations of MRI-based neuroplasticity research in stroke remain underexplored. We conducted a bibliometric analysis of publications indexed in Scopus from January 2004 to December 2024. Eligible studies were original articles and reviews assessing neuroplasticity in stroke using MRI modalities. Citation Classics were defined as ≥100 citations. Performance indicators (citations, citation rate per year, active years, authorship, article type) were compared using Mann-Whitney U and Chi-square tests. Science mapping was performed with Biblioshiny (K-Synth Srl, Naples, Italy) and VOSviewer (Centre for Science and Technology Studies, Leiden University, Leiden, The Netherlands) to identify intellectual, conceptual, and collaborative structures. From 854 initial records, 100 most-cited articles were included (59-1,274 citations). Citation Classics (n = 62) had significantly higher mean citation counts and rates per year than non-Classics (p < 0.0001). Reviews predominated among Classics, while original research was more frequent in non-Classics. High-impact journals ( Brain , Stroke , Neurorehabilitation and Neural Repair , and NeuroImage ) accounted for the most influential articles, with strong correlations between journal metrics and citation performance. Leading institutions were Harvard Medical School, University of Cambridge, and University of California, Irvine, while the United States, Germany, and the United Kingdom dominated global contributions. Emerging countries, including China and Japan, showed increasing participation. Science mapping revealed clusters on motor recovery, cortical reorganization, language rehabilitation, and emerging areas such as connectomics and machine learning. This study provides a comprehensive overview of MRI-based neuroplasticity research in stroke, identifying seminal works, leading contributors, and evolving research themes. While citation activity has declined in recent years, advances in connectomics, multi-modal imaging, and computational approaches offer promising directions. Expanding global collaborations and addressing underrepresented regions will be critical for inclusive progress. MRI remains central to bridging mechanistic insights with clinical applications, guiding innovation in personalized stroke rehabilitation.",

  "full_text": "Introduction and background\n\nStroke is an acute vascular condition that produces neurological deficits [ 1 ]. Traditionally, it was considered a localized disease affecting only the infarcted region [ 2 ]. Advances in neuroanatomy and physiology, however, have shown that focal lesions disrupt activity in distant areas, including the non-affected hemisphere, through a phenomenon known as connectional diaschisis [ 3 ]. Stroke remains one of the leading causes of long-term disability worldwide, imposing a substantial burden on patients, caregivers, and healthcare systems [ 4 - 6 ].\n\nRecovery after stroke is mediated by multiple factors. Spontaneous recovery predominates during the first three to six months, while rehabilitation is essential in both acute and chronic stages to consolidate functional gains [ 7 - 9 ]. A critical substrate for these processes is neuroplasticity, defined as the brain’s ability to reorganize and form new connections after injury. Neuroplasticity reflects the nervous system’s intrinsic capacity to adapt to environmental changes, experiences, and external stimuli, enabling compensatory mechanisms in the presence of structural damage [ 7 , 8 , 10 , 11 ]. After a stroke, several biological processes, including neurogenesis, synaptogenesis, neuronal reorganization, and compensatory pathways, contribute to recovery [ 12 - 15 ].\n\nTo study these mechanisms, a range of non-invasive techniques has been used. Electroencephalography (EEG), magnetoencephalography (MEG), positron emission tomography (PET), transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), and transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) are widely applied to assess brain activity, metabolism, and cortical excitability [ 2 , 8 , 16 ]. Among these, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has emerged as a cornerstone tool for evaluating neuroplasticity.\n\nMRI provides high-resolution structural and functional information, making it uniquely suited to investigate neural reorganization after stroke. Submodalities such as diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) allow visualization of white matter tracts [ 17 ], assessment of fiber orientation, and mapping of structural connectivity. Functional MRI (fMRI) measures hemodynamic responses to neural activity, enabling both task-based and resting-state network mapping [ 18 ]. Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) provides metabolic insights by quantifying biochemical changes associated with cerebral ischemia [ 2 , 10 , 16 , 19 ]. Together, these techniques establish MRI as a versatile platform for exploring brain plasticity.\n\nBibliometric analysis, defined as the quantitative study of publications and citations to identify influential research and emerging trends, offers a systematic way to assess the intellectual development of this field. Unlike traditional literature reviews, bibliometric studies enable both performance analysis, focusing on output and citation metrics, and science mapping, which identifies conceptual linkages and collaborative networks [ 20 - 22 ].\n\nIn this study, we applied a bibliometric approach to evaluate two decades (2004-2024) of MRI-based research on neuroplasticity in stroke. By integrating performance analysis with science mapping, we aimed to capture not only publication and citation trends but also the intellectual, conceptual, and collaborative structures shaping this area. This scoping approach provides a comprehensive overview of how MRI has informed understanding of post-stroke neuroplasticity, offering neurologists, rehabilitation specialists, and imaging researchers curated access to seminal contributions, thematic clusters, and future research priorities.\n\nReview\n\nMethods\n\nSearch Methodology and Data Sources\n\nA comprehensive literature search was conducted in Scopus ( https://www.scopus.com/home.uri ) on October 18, 2024. The timeframe was restricted to publications between January 2004 and December 2024. Impact Factor (IF) values and quartile classifications (Q1-Q4) were retrieved from Clarivate Analytics’ Journal Citation Reports ( https://jcr.clarivate.com/jcr ). The search strategy was organized into four domains: MRI modalities, neuroplasticity, stroke, and exclusions (Table 1 ).\n\nInclusion and Exclusion Criteria\n\nEligible studies were original research articles or reviews evaluating neuroplasticity in stroke survivors using MRI modalities. Exclusion criteria were: studies involving animal models or conditions other than stroke; non-peer-reviewed outputs (e.g., conference proceedings, editorials, short surveys, letters, book chapters); and publications not written in English.\n\nScreening and Selection Process\n\nThe search initially identified 854 records. After removing duplicates, titles and abstracts were screened independently by two reviewers (G.M.G. and E.R.V.) to assess compliance with eligibility criteria. Disagreements were resolved by consensus. Following full-text review, the 100 most-cited articles were retained for analysis. This bibliometric study was not registered in PROSPERO, as it does not synthesize clinical outcomes, but it followed the PRISMA-ScR (Scoping Review) guidelines [ 20 ] to ensure methodological transparency and replicability, the selection pathway is illustrated in Figure 1 (PRISMA flow diagram).\n\nDefinition of Bibliometric Analysis\n\nBibliometric analysis (BA) is a quantitative approach to evaluating authorship patterns, journal impact, and publication influence within a research field [ 21 , 22 ]. By analyzing citation data, BA identifies seminal studies, research trends, institutions, and collaborative networks.\n\nIdentification of Citation Classics\n\nFollowing Garfield’s original definition [ 23 ], articles with ≥100 citations were classified as Citation Classics. Articles with <100 citations were categorized as Non-Classics.\n\nBibliometric Analysis Techniques\n\nTwo complementary approaches were applied [ 21 ]: (1) Performance analysis quantified research output through the following indicators: total publications (TP), number of active years of publication (NAY), articles per active year (APY), number of contributing authors (NCA), and classification as sole-authored (SA) or co-authored (CA). (2) Science mapping explored intellectual structures, conceptual linkages, and collaborative networks through co-citation, keyword co-occurrence, and co-authorship analysis.\n\nStatistical Analysis\n\nComparisons between Citation Classics and non-Classics were performed using: Chi-squared test (χ²) for categorical variables; and Mann-Whitney U test for nonparametric continuous variables.\n\nFor each group, means, standard deviations (SD), and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated. Journal bibliometric metrics (Impact Factor (IF), CiteScore, SCImago Journal Rank (SJR), and Source Normalized Impact per Paper (SNIP)) were summarized with medians, quartiles, and interquartile ranges (IQRs). Associations between bibliometric measures and citation performance were assessed with Spearman’s ρ, and scatterplots were generated for visualization. Statistical significance was set at p < 0.05 [ 24 , 25 ].\n\nSoftware: Data handling was performed with Microsoft Excel v.16.67 (Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, WA, USA). Statistical analyses were conducted in R v.4.4.1 (The R Foundation, Vienna, Austria). The Biblioshiny package (K-Synth Srl, Naples, Italy) [ 26 ] was used for performance analysis. VOSviewer v.1.6.20 (Centre for Science and Technology Studies, Leiden University, Leiden, The Netherlands) [ 27 ] generated science mapping visualizations. Thresholds were defined as follows: ≥10 citations per author, ≥2 documents for institutions, countries, or journals, and ≥5 keyword co-occurrences.\n\nResults\n\nPerformance Analysis\n\nRetrieval and Selection of Articles: The Scopus search yielded 854 records related to MRI-based neuroplasticity research in stroke. Restricting the timeframe to 2004-2024 reduced this to 804 records. Exclusion of conference papers, books, editorials, short surveys, letters, and non-human studies left 750 records. Limiting to English-language publications yielded 715 records. After duplicate removal and manual screening, 648 articles remained. From these, the 100 most-cited articles were retained for analysis (Table 2 ). The selection workflow is depicted in Figure 1 (PRISMA flow diagram).\n\nYearly Publications and Citations: Annual publication output showed fluctuations, with a peak of 13 articles in 2006 (Figure 2A ). After 2012, output declined, stabilizing at fewer than five publications per year after 2014. The overall mean publication rate across the two decades was 5.5 articles per year.\n\nCitation activity followed a similar trajectory, peaking at 3,042 citations in 2006 (Figure 2B ). Despite subsequent declines, modest rebounds in 2019 and 2020 reflected the enduring influence of foundational works. On average, the dataset accumulated 967 citations per year, underscoring the sustained relevance of seminal MRI studies in stroke neuroplasticity.\n\nCitation Classics vs. Non-Classics: Of the 100 analyzed articles, 62 qualified as Citation Classics (≥100 citations) and 38 as Non-Classics (<100 citations). Citation Classics accrued a higher mean citation count (234.1 ± 198.4; 95% CI, 184.9-283.3) compared with Non-Classics (75.9 ± 12.4; 95% CI, 71.8-80.0; p < 0.0001). Similarly, the average citation rate per year was significantly higher among Classics (15.7 ± 10.9; 95% CI, 13.0-18.4) than Non-Classics (6.4 ± 3.6; 95% CI, 5.3-7.5; p < 0.0001) (Table 3 ).\n\nNo significant difference was found in years active (15.3 ± 4.6 vs. 14.0 ± 4.9; p = 0.162) or number of authors per article (6.3 ± 5.9 vs. 5.3 ± 3.4; p = 0.295).\n\nAuthorship patterns revealed that 93% of all publications were co-authored, with no significant difference between groups (p = 0.279). In terms of article type, original research comprised 73% of the dataset and reviews 27%, with no significant variation between groups (p = 0.904) (Table 4 ).\n\nTemporal distribution showed a concentration of Classics in 2006 (nine publications), coinciding with landmark fMRI and DTI studies on cortical reorganization. Non-Classics contributed more steadily but with lower overall impact.\n\nFigure 3A illustrates the yearly distribution of Citation Classics and Non-Classics in terms of the number of articles. The data reveal a peak in Citation Classics in 2006, with nine publications, marking a period of heightened research activity. In contrast, Non-Classics demonstrated a steady but lower contribution across the years, reflecting their limited impact compared to highly cited works. The trends suggest that seminal publications from earlier years continue to dominate the field.\n\nFigure 3B provides further insights into citation trends, highlighting a pronounced citation peak in 2006, coinciding with the highest number of Citation Classics published. While the citation count for Non-Classics remained consistently low throughout the years, Citation Classics exhibited significant variability, reflecting the disproportionate influence of certain high-impact articles. The declining citation rates for Citation Classics after 2010 may indicate a natural lifecycle of citation accumulation as the field evolves.\n\nJournals and Bibliometric Profiles: Highly cited articles were concentrated in a small group of high-impact journals (Table 5 ).\n\nBrain published 10 articles (3,514 citations; 20.2% of total). Stroke published nine articles (1,744 citations; 10%). Neurorehabilitation and Neural Repair contributed nine articles (1,403 citations; 8.1%). Review journals such as Annual Review of Neuroscience and Brain Research Reviews also ranked highly, with annual citation rates of 37.5 and 37.0, respectively. Among original research outlets, NeuroImage contributed seven studies (982 citations; 5.6%), reflecting its emphasis on advanced MRI techniques.\n\nCorrelation analyses demonstrated strong associations between journal bibliometric indices and citation performance: IF and CiteScore (r = 0.98), SNIP (r = 0.97), and SJR (r = 0.92) (Figure 4 ).\n\nMost journals belonged to Q1 categories, underscoring the dominance of neuroscience and neurology outlets (Table 6 ).\n\nInstitutional Contributions: Leading institutions were responsible for a disproportionate share of highly cited work (Table 7 ).\n\nHarvard Medical School produced five articles (1,854 citations; 10.7%). The University of Cambridge contributed three articles (877 citations). University of Freiburg achieved 876 citations with a single paper, yielding the highest per-year average (46.0). Prominent U.S. centers included the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) (817 citations) and UC Irvine (733 citations). European leaders included Tübingen, UCL, and Oxford. Beijing Normal University represented emerging Asian participation with one article (527 citations; 35/year).\n\nThese findings reflect both resource concentration in high-income countries and growing engagement from non-Western institutions.\n\nCountry-Level Contributions: Geographic analysis confirmed the dominance of the United States, contributing 46 articles and 8,010 citations (46%). Germany ranked second with 17 articles (3,417 citations; 19.6%), followed by the UK with nine articles (2,203 citations; 12.7%) (Table 8 , Figure 5 ).\n\nChina ranked fourth with eight publications (1,130 citations; 6.5%), reflecting rapid expansion in neuroimaging research. Other notable contributors included France, the Netherlands, and Canada.\n\nSmaller nations made high-impact contributions: Denmark (20 citations/year) and Switzerland (22/year) produced single but influential papers. Emerging economies such as India, Mexico, and South Korea showed modest output but promising average citations (~9-10 per year).\n\nCross-country bibliographic coupling indicated strong collaborations among the U.S., UK, and Germany, but limited representation from Latin America and Africa.\n\nScience Mapping\n\nIntellectual Structure of the Field: The intellectual structure of MRI-based research on stroke neuroplasticity was visualized through co-citation and bibliographic coupling networks (Figure 6A - 6D ).\n\nAuthor co-citation network (Figure 6A ) - Central nodes included Cohen L.G., Pascual-Leone A., and Friston K.J., whose foundational contributions span brain plasticity, neurorehabilitation, and advanced modeling. Other frequently co-cited authors such as Rothwell J.C., Rossini P.M., and Taub E. formed interconnected clusters emphasizing cortical stimulation, fMRI-based recovery, and rehabilitation theory. Authors including Grefkes C., Hallett M., and Weiller C. highlighted integration of MRI with clinical neurorehabilitation.\n\nCountry-level bibliographic coupling (Figure 6B ) - The United States dominated output and collaborations, followed by Germany, the UK, and China. Strong cross-links also involved France, Italy, and Canada. Emerging clusters in Japan, Spain, and India underscored rising international participation.\n\nInstitutional network (Figure 6C ) - Harvard Medical School and UC Irvine emerged as hubs, with additional key contributions from King’s College London and the Massachusetts General Hospital/Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MGH/MIT) Athinoula A. Martinos Center. These institutions exemplify the importance of multidisciplinary environments combining neurology, radiology, and neuroscience.\n\nJournal co-citation map (Figure 6D ) - Core journals included Brain , Stroke , NeuroImage , and Neurorehabilitation and Neural Repair . Strong co-citation ties were observed between Brain and Stroke , and between NeuroImage and Neuropsychologia . Additional influential outlets included Neuron , Cerebral Cortex , Annual Review of Neuroscience , and Neurology .\n\nConceptual Structure and Research Themes: Keyword co-occurrence analysis revealed distinct thematic clusters (Figure 6E ):\n\nMotor recovery and rehabilitation - Central terms included “neuroplasticity,” “stroke,” “motor performance,” and “recovery of function,” linked with “gait rehabilitation,” “mirror therapy,” “robotics,” and “muscle training.”\n\nCortical reorganization and imaging - Anchored by “cerebral cortex,” “functional neuroimaging,” and “image processing,” this cluster linked imaging findings with outcomes such as pyramidal tract integrity, oxygenation, and innervation.\n\nLanguage and aphasia - Terms included “aphasia,” “semantics,” “white matter,” and “hippocampus,” with related concepts such as “anomia” and “language testing.”\n\nNeurophysiology and recovery mechanisms - A smaller cluster that captured concepts such as “motor evoked potentials,” “reaction time,” and “grip strength,” reflecting integration of neuroimaging with physiological measures.\n\nThese clusters collectively illustrate the integration of structural, functional, and behavioral dimensions in MRI-based stroke neuroplasticity research.\n\nCollaboration Networks: Author-level co-authorship networks (Figure 6F ) highlighted the collaborative nature of the field.\n\nThe largest cluster was led by Steven C. Cramer, with extensive collaborations on imaging-based stroke recovery.\n\nJerzy P. Szaflarski represented another hub, bridging groups focused on motor recovery, functional connectivity, and cognitive outcomes.\n\nA smaller but cohesive cluster led by Roy H. Hamilton and Catherine Norise emphasized non-invasive brain stimulation and cognitive rehabilitation, supported by contributions from Coslett H. Branch.\n\nAnother subgroup led by Page Stephen J. and Kissela Brett M. focused on motor recovery and neuroimaging, connecting closely with Szaflarski’s cluster.\n\nOverall, the collaboration landscape displayed a hierarchical yet interconnected structure, with Cramer, Szaflarski, and Hamilton serving as pivotal figures. Smaller clusters complemented these hubs, reflecting both breadth and specialization across institutions and research foci.\n\nDiscussion\n\nOverview of Performance Trends\n\nThe retrieval and selection of the top 100 most-cited articles underscore the pivotal role of MRI in advancing the understanding of neuroplasticity after stroke. This bibliometric focus highlights not only methodological rigor but also the intellectual and clinical influence of MRI-based investigations over the last two decades. Identifying highly cited works provides a framework for recognizing research trends, leading authors, and key institutions, while also guiding future studies toward emerging imaging modalities and multidisciplinary approaches in neurorehabilitation.\n\nPublication and Citation Patterns\n\nAnnual publication and citation trends revealed distinct phases in the evolution of MRI-based neuroplasticity research. The surge in 2006 reflected a turning point marked by fMRI mapping of motor recovery and DTI assessment of white matter integrity [ 33 , 62 , 65 ]. These seminal contributions established MRI as a cornerstone of stroke rehabilitation research. Between 2004 and 2012, steady productivity sustained advances in cortical reorganization and recovery mechanisms [ 36 , 38 , 51 ]. After 2012, declines in both publications and citations suggested a shift toward newer imaging techniques and rehabilitation strategies, though landmark works from the mid-2000s continued to dominate. Citation rebounds in 2019-2020 underscored the enduring impact of studies on functional connectivity and advanced MRI-based monitoring of neuroplastic changes [ 2 , 75 , 78 , 124 ]. These dynamics confirm the lasting influence of early contributions while highlighting opportunities for innovation through connectomics, multi-modal imaging, and longitudinal approaches.\n\nCitation Classics vs. Non-Classics\n\nComparisons between Citation Classics (≥100 citations) and non-Classics showed that Classics achieved higher citation rates per year, underscoring their sustained relevance. Reviews were more common among Classics, synthesizing evidence on fMRI, DTI, and resting-state functional connectivity [ 29 , 35 , 37 ]. In contrast, Citation Classics often represented original studies showcasing detailed clinical or technical applications [ 45 , 63 , 66 , 71 ]. The peak period of Classics around 2006 corresponded to landmark studies on perilesional cortical recruitment and hemispheric activation shifts [ 70 , 100 , 112 ]. Their subsequent decline likely reflects thematic saturation and the difficulty of producing equally influential work. Future high-impact contributions may arise from combining MRI with complementary modalities such as EEG and MEG, integrating neuromodulation approaches like TMS and tDCS, and applying machine learning to predictive rehabilitation models.\n\nJournals and Dissemination Platforms\n\nThe analysis reinforced the dominance of a small number of high-impact journals. NeuroImage , Brain , and Stroke accounted for the majority of influential publications, particularly those advancing fMRI and DTI [ 14 , 46 , 48 ]. Specialized outlets, including Neurorehabilitation and Neural Repair and Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation , emphasized translational studies on therapies, telerehabilitation, and training interventions [ 60 , 72 , 112 ]. Correlations between journal bibliometric metrics and citation performance highlighted the visibility advantage of top-ranked journals. While broad-scope journals ensured wide dissemination, selective outlets such as Cerebral Cortex and Restorative Neurology and Neuroscience maintained strong citation averages despite smaller publication volumes. Highly cited works addressed cortical reorganization, functional recovery, and structural integrity [ 34 , 71 , 85 ], while more recent themes - connectomics, multimodal imaging, and network plasticity - signal evolving directions for impactful dissemination [ 56 , 81 , 107 ].\n\nInstitutional and Geographic Contributions\n\nInstitutions such as UC Irvine, Harvard Medical School, and King’s College London consistently drove highly cited research, supported by infrastructure and interdisciplinary collaborations. UC Irvine contributed extensively to fMRI and DTI studies of cortical reorganization, while Harvard advanced resting-state connectivity research through the MGH/MIT Athinoula A. Martinos Center. King’s College London focused on white matter integrity and structural plasticity. European centers such as Oxford and Tübingen added expertise in cognitive recovery and non-invasive stimulation.\n\nAt the national level, the United States dominated both output and citations, followed by the UK and Germany. China, Japan, and Canada showed increasing productivity, with Chinese teams integrating multimodal MRI and machine learning, and Japanese groups emphasizing cerebral reorganization and rehabilitation outcomes. Strong bibliographic coupling revealed extensive collaborations among the US, UK, and Germany, but limited participation of Latin America and Africa. Expanding collaborative networks in these regions remains essential to reducing disparities and ensuring global applicability of findings.\n\nScience Mapping and Intellectual Structure\n\nScience mapping revealed an interconnected research landscape shaped by leading institutions and authors. Harvard, UC Irvine, and King’s College London emerged as intellectual hubs, advancing fMRI, resting-state connectivity, and white matter integrity studies. Influential figures such as Pascual-Leone, with seminal work on non-invasive brain stimulation [ 125 - 128 ], and Friston, through dynamic causal modeling [ 129 - 132 ], established frameworks that integrated neuroimaging with neurophysiological insights. Core journals, including Brain , Stroke , and NeuroImage , served as key platforms consolidating progress and visibility.\n\nConceptual Clusters and Emerging Areas\n\nKeyword mapping highlighted clusters centered on neuroplasticity, motor recovery, and structural connectivity, reaffirming the importance of fMRI and DTI in stroke rehabilitation. Emerging themes included connectomics and neurochemical imaging with MRS, reflecting a transition toward large-scale brain network mapping and biochemical profiling [ 2 , 89 ]. Translational priorities were evident in clusters on language recovery, robotic rehabilitation, and task-based neuroplasticity [ 45 , 49 , 76 , 101 , 122 ], underscoring the effort to bridge imaging insights with clinical outcomes.\n\nCollaboration Networks\n\nCollaboration patterns showed highly interconnected structures. Steven C. Cramer emerged as a central figure in motor recovery and imaging-based rehabilitation [ 61 , 133 ], while Jerzy Szaflarski bridged domains of functional connectivity and cognitive recovery [ 112 ]. Roy H. Hamilton and collaborators contributed significantly to non-invasive brain stimulation [ 134 ]. Strong cross-national collaborations were evident among the US, UK, and Germany, though Latin America and Africa remained underrepresented. Multinational teams increasingly addressed novel technologies such as brain-computer interfaces, virtual reality, and integrative rehabilitation strategies [ 42 , 49 , 106 , 110 ].\n\nInternational collaborations were strongly associated with higher citation impact, reflecting the synergistic benefits of shared expertise, access to advanced imaging infrastructure, and broader dissemination across multiple networks. However, the underrepresentation of Asia, Africa, and South America likely reflects both resource disparities in neuroimaging availability and database indexing biases that favor North American and European outputs. Strengthening global partnerships and expanding indexing inclusivity will be essential for broadening the scope and clinical applicability of MRI-based neuroplasticity research.\n\nEvolution of Neuroplasticity Research\n\nBetween 2010-2015, research focused on motor recovery and cortical reorganization, establishing neuroplasticity as a foundation of rehabilitation science. From 2016-2020, multimodal imaging and brain stimulation gained prominence, reflecting interest in combining MRI with neuromodulatory and neurophysiological methods. Since 2021, connectomics and machine learning have risen rapidly, signaling a paradigm shift toward computational neuroscience and predictive modeling.\n\nCitation trajectories (Figure 7 ) showed successive waves of influence: early dominance of functional connectivity, followed by multimodal integration, and most recently, computational approaches. Connectomics and machine learning studies have achieved the highest recent citation rates, while functional connectivity and imaging biomarkers remain enduring anchors.\n\nRecent Advances and Translational Innovations\n\nRecent progress includes improved diagnostic tools, collaborative research, and therapeutic innovation. High-resolution fMRI and PET now enable earlier identification of dysfunctional networks [ 135 ], while machine learning augments prognostic modeling [ 136 ]. International collaborations have facilitated VR-based telerehabilitation [ 137 ], expanding access and engagement. Therapeutic advances include non-invasive brain stimulation (TMS, tDCS), robotic-assisted therapy, and immersive VR platforms [ 138 - 140 ], each enhancing recovery and real-world skill transfer. These advances demonstrate how neuroplasticity research continues to shape clinical practice.\n\nLimitations\n\nThis study has several limitations. Reliance on citation counts privileges older, highly cited works and may underrepresent recent but high-quality contributions. Although citation rates per year were reported to mitigate age-related bias, field-weighted metrics were not applied. The top-100 cutoff may also exclude niche but relevant studies, such as those on connectomics or longitudinal designs. Exclusive reliance on Scopus and restriction to English-language publications introduce database and language bias, while the absence of dual independent screening and reliance on a single primary reviewer raise the possibility of selection bias. Finally, the dominance of high-income countries highlights disparities in global access to imaging, and the study did not evaluate methodological rigor or clinical applicability, limiting interpretability for direct patient outcomes.\n\nFuture directions\n\nThe intellectual and collaborative structures in this field reflect strong foundations and promising new directions. Advances in connectomics and multimodal imaging offer opportunities to uncover novel biomarkers, while qualitative assessments of study design and translational outcomes will improve clinical relevance. Expanding global collaboration, especially with underrepresented regions, remains critical for equitable progress. By combining historical insights with emerging computational tools, MRI-based neuroplasticity research is well-positioned to drive innovation in personalized rehabilitation and long-term recovery after stroke.\n\nConclusions\n\nThis bibliometric analysis offers a comprehensive overview of the intellectual landscape, key concepts, and collaborative networks that have shaped MRI-based neuroplasticity research in stroke. By examining the 100 most-cited articles, the study highlights the central role of fMRI and DTI in elucidating cortical reorganization, structural connectivity, and motor recovery mechanisms. Contributions from leading institutions such as Harvard Medical School and the University of California, Irvine underscore the importance of interdisciplinary collaboration and methodological innovation in advancing the field.\n\nThe findings also reveal the concentration of influential research in high-impact journals, including Brain , Stroke , and NeuroImage , which serve as primary platforms for disseminating both foundational and translational advances. Prominent authors such as Steven C. Cramer and Jerzy Szaflarski exemplify the collaborative networks that have accelerated clinical translation and sustained academic influence.\n\nAlthough overall publication and citation activity have declined in recent years, the rapid growth of connectomics, multimodal imaging, and machine learning approaches signals a promising revitalization of the field. Expanding international collaborations, particularly with underrepresented regions, will be essential for ensuring inclusivity and global applicability of findings.\n\nIn conclusion, MRI continues to serve as a cornerstone in stroke neuroplasticity research, bridging mechanistic insights with clinical applications. Future progress will depend on integrating advanced imaging modalities, fostering multidisciplinary networks, and prioritizing translational outcomes to enhance rehabilitation strategies and ultimately improve patient care.",
