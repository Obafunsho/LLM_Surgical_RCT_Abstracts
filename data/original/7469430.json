  "title": "Left Ventricular Thinning and Distension in Pig Hearts as a Reproducible Ex Vivo Model of Functional Mitral Regurgitation",
  "abstract": "Objective: Functional mitral regurgitation in the setting of an enlarged heart is challenging to repair surgically with an annular approach, and the need to develop sub-annular and ventricular approaches is recognized yet unrealized due to the lack of models for investigations. In this study, we report a novel model of functional mitral regurgitation induced by left ventricular thinning and distension in pig hearts.\n\nMethods: Seven pig hearts were explanted at a local slaughterhouse, and left ventricular distension induced by thinning the ventricular myocardium by 60–65% of its original thickness. Distension of the thinned hearts with a 120mmHg column, confirmed significant left ventricular dilatation and mitral valve tethering. These hearts were then mounted into a pulsatile flow model, and animated at 120mm Hg left ventricular pressure, 5L/min cardiac output at 70 beats per minute. Echocardiography was used to assess valvular kinematics and hemodynamics.\n\nResults: Left ventricular wall thickness reduced by 60.5±10.1% at the basal plane, 64.8±11.3% at the equatorial plane and 64.0±11.4% at the apical plane after thinning. Upon distension, ventricular volumes increased by 852.4±639.8% after LV thinning, with an 89.5±33.9% increase in sphericity index. Mitral valve systolic tenting height increased from 7.92±2.06 mm to 15.02±3.89 mm, systolic tethering area increased from 130.7±38.2 mm 2 to 409.9±124.6 mm 2 and an average mitral regurgitation fraction of 24.4±16.6% was measured. In a case study, use of multi-modality imaging to test the efficacy of transcatheter mitral devices was confirmed.\n\nConclusions: Ventricular wall thinning leading to passive left ventricular distension and dilatation is a reproducible ex vivo model of mitral valve tethering and functional mitral regurgitation, which in combination with multi-modality imaging provides a good simulation model.",
