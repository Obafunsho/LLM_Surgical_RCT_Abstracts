  "title": "Mesh Reinforcement of Pancreatic Transection Decreases Incidence of Pancreatic Occlusion Failure for Left Pancreatectomy: A Single-Blinded, Randomized Controlled Trial",
  "abstract": "Introduction: Pancreatic leak or fistula is the most frequent complication following left pancreatectomy. We performed a single-blinded, parallel-group, randomized controlled trial comparing stapled left pancreatectomy with stapled left pancreatectomy using mesh reinforcement of the staple line with either Seamguard ® or Peristrips Dry ® .\n\nMethods: All patients undergoing left pancreatectomy at a large tertiary hospital were eligible for participation. Patients were randomized to either mesh reinforcement or no mesh reinforcement intraoperatively after being determined a candidate for resection. Patients were blinded to the result of their randomization for 6 weeks. Primary outcome measure was clinically significant leak as defined by the ISGPF pancreatic leak grading system.\n\nResults: One hundred patients were randomized to either mesh (54) or no mesh (46) reinforcement of their pancreatic transection. There was one death in each group. ISGPF grade B and C leaks were seen in 1.9% (1/53) of patients undergoing resection with mesh reinforcement and 20% (11/45) of patients without mesh reinforcement (p=0.0007).\n\nConclusions: Mesh reinforcement of pancreatic transection line significantly reduces the incidence of significant pancreatic fistula in patients undergoing left pancreatectomy.\n\nTrial Registration: Clinicaltrials.gov: NCT01359410",
