The irregular and disorganized rhythm in the atria of\nthe heart, characteristic of AF, is associated with a significant increase in the\nrisk of stroke, dementia, heart failure, and death [ 2 ] .\n\nAF is one of the most prevalent cardiac arrhythmias, affecting 33,5 million people\nworldwide and more than 1,2 million Brazilians. Approximately 170,000 new cases of\nAF are recorded each year in Brazil [ 3 , 4 ] . From 2008 to 2021, there were 406,666 hospitalizations\nin Brazil due to AF, generating total costs, after adjustment for Brazilian\ninflation, of R$569,678,472.00 [ 3 , 5 ] .\n\nData from the Estudo Longitudinal de Saúde do Adulto ELSA-Brasil\npopulation-based study show a prevalence of AF of 0.3% (men, 0.5%; women, 0.2%).\nThis prevalence is highly associated with advancing age, reaching 7.0% in\noctogenarians (8.4% in men vs. 5.9% in women), and with other risk\nfactors, such as hypertension, heart failure, coronary artery disease, valvular\nheart disease, obesity, diabetes mellitus, obstructive sleep apnea, and chronic\nkidney disease [ 5 , 6 ] . Another risk group is\npatients presenting for cardiac surgery, 11% of whom have a known history of AF.\nThis incidence rises to 30% to 50% in patients who are candidates for mitral valve\nsurgery [ 1 ] .\n\nThe goals of AF treatment include ventricular rate control, rhythm control, and\nprevention of thromboembolism. Therapeutic modalities include the use of\nantiarrhythmic drugs (AADs), electrical cardioversion, catheter ablation, and\nsurgical ablation (SA) [ 2 ] . This update aims to review the state of the art of SA\nwith emphasis on the Cox-Maze IV (CM-IV) procedure associated with the exclusion of\nthe left atrial appendage (LAA) in those patients refractory to other therapeutic\nmodalities [ 1 , 5 ] .\n\nHISTORICAL EVOLUTION OF SURGICAL ABLATION FOR ATRIAL FIBRILLATION\n\nThe first surgical approaches to the treatment of AF consisted of left atrial\nisolation, also known as the corridor procedure, and atrial transection. Both\ntechniques were able to control the irregular rapid rate, but by leaving one or both\natria in fibrillation, they could not correct the problems of loss of atrial\ncontraction and risk of thromboembolism.\n\nIn 1986, Cox and collaborators improved the atrial transection that later culminated\nin the maze procedure [ 7 ] . This procedure is designed to interrupt any and all\nmacroreentrant circuits, while at the same time directing the sinus impulse along a\nspecific route, thus preserving the functions of the sinoatrial node and atrial\nconduction. Subsequent modifications were developed to address the problems of\ntransient sinus node dysfunction and left atrial dysfunction resulting in what\nbecame known as the Cox-Maze III (CM-III) procedure, also called “cut-and-sew,”\nbecoming the gold standard compared to previous techniques.\n\nAlthough CM-III is effective for permanent ablation of AF, it has not been widely\nadopted due to operative complexity, invasiveness, and morbidity (bleeding, cardiac\nrupture, coronary occlusion) [ 8 ] . The emergence of devices and energy sources such as\nradiofrequency and cryotherapy allowed the development of a less complex operation,\ngiving rise to the CM-IV procedure, which quickly became the most common SA modality\nfor AF today, being used in > 60% of patients with AF who require concomitant\nmitral valve surgery. These thermal energy source devices function as alternatives\nto surgical incisions, and their success depends on the ability to recreate the\ncontinuity, linearity, and transmurality of the surgical lesions performed in\nCM-III [ 9 ] .\n\nINDICATIONS FOR SURGICAL ABLATION FOR ATRIAL FIBRILLATION\n\nSA of AF may be indicated primarily alone or concomitantly with other cardiac\nsurgeries.\n\nIsolated Primary Surgical Ablation\n\nAccording to the 2023 Society of Thoracic Surgeons (STS) Clinical Practice\nGuidelines for Surgical Treatment of Atrial Fibrillation, isolated primary SA is\na reasonable procedure for symptomatic AF in the absence of structural heart\ndisease refractory to class I/III AADs and/or catheter ablative therapy (class\nIIA, level of evidence [LOE] B-R) [ 10 ] . The 2017 Heart Rhythm Society (HRS)\nConsensus also considers the same class IIA indication for isolated primary SA\nin those patients who prefer a surgical approach rather than catheter ablation,\nprovided that refractoriness or intolerance to at least one class I or class III\nAADs is demonstrated [ 11 ] .\n\nBoth societies (STS and HRS) recommend CM-III or CM-IV instead of pulmonary vein\nisolation (PVI) for persistent or long-standing persistent AF (class IIA, LOE\nB-NR) and do not recommend PVI alone in the presence of more than moderate\nmitral regurgitation (class III, LOE-C). The STS guidelines also do not\nrecommend PVI alone if the left atrial dimension is ≥ 4.5 cm (class III,\nLOE-C) [ 10 , 11 ] .\n\nSurgical Ablation Concomitant with Other Operations\n\nThe STS 2023 guidelines recommend SA for AF at the time of concomitant mitral\nvalve operations (class I, LOE A) or for any other primary elective cardiac\nsurgery (first surgery) with the aim of restoring sinus rhythm and improving\nlong-term outcomes (class I, LOE B-NR) [ 10 ] .\n\nLeft Atrial Appendage Occlusion\n\nThe LAA is a potential source of cerebral emboli in patients with AF. For these\npatients, long-term reduction in stroke risk comes from restoration of sinus\nrhythm, elimination of the LAA, and/or restoration of atrial contraction. LAA\nexcision/exclusion is recommended both in primary SA alone (HRS consensus LOE\nB-R) and in SAs concomitant with other elective primary cardiac operations (STS,\nclass I, LOE-A, and HRS consensus LOE C-EO guidelines) [ 10 , 11 ] .\n\nOPERATIVE TECHNIQUE: COX-MAZE IV\n\nThe Cox-Maze procedure is considered the most effective surgical treatment for AF.\nIts main goals include:\n\nCM-IV uses energy sources to create ablation lines that replicate the CM-III\ncut-and-sew lesions using bipolar radiofrequency (BRF) and\ncryotherapy [ 12 , 13 ] . The approaches to the CM-IV are the median sternotomy\nfor AF ablation concomitant with another cardiac operation and the right\nminithoracotomy approach for those cases in which primary SA alone is\nsufficient.\n\nCox-Maze IV by Sternotomy\n\nConcomitant SA can be classified as “open”, in which a left atriotomy is an\nintegral part of the primary operation, such as mitral valve repair or\nreplacement (with or without tricuspid valve repair), or “closed”, in which a\nleft atriotomy is not necessary for the primary procedure, e.g. , coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) +/- aortic valve\nreplacement.\n\n“Open” SA allows for the full set of CM-IV lesions, which consists of left atrial\nand right atrial lesions as follows:\n\nLeft Atrial Lesion (L)\n\nL1-4: Isolation of the posterior left atrium - “box lesion”\n\nThe box lesion consists of performing four lesions to electrically isolate\nthe entire posterior part of the left atrium (LA), covering all the\npulmonary veins (PVs) and the posterior left atrial tissue between the PVs.\nIn this way, two separate ablation lesions are created - one around the left\nPVs and one around the right PVs. These vertical lesions are connected to\neach other by means of two horizontal lines forming a “box”: left atrial\nroof line (connecting superior PVs) and left atrial floor line (connecting\ninferior PVs) ( Figure 1 ).\n\nL5: Mitral isthmus line (including coronary sinus)\n\nThis step consists of creating a linear lesion connecting the left atrial\nisolation box to the mitral annulus, which is electrically nonconductive.\nThis lesion is essential to prevent typical and atypical atrial flutter. The\ncoronary sinus (CS) should be ablated at this time to prevent aberrant\nconduction of electrical signals that lead to atrial flutter around the\nmitral annulus region ( Figure 2 ).\n\nLeft atrial isolation is completed by the occlusion of the LAA. LAA occlusion\ntechniques include excision and suture, internal ligation, and external\nexclusion applied by devices such as staplers, endoloops, and by specially\ndesigned devices such as the Food and Drug Administration-cleared\nAtriClip® LAA Exclusion System (AtriCure Inc.) that, in addition to\nexclusion, electrically isolates the LAA [ 14 ] . Excision and application of an\nepicardial exclusion device such as the AtriClip® have been shown to\nbe the most effective means of eliminating the LAA. However, in both\ntechniques, it is important not to leave a stump, because residual LAA\ntissue has been shown to be prothrombotic [ 13 ] .\n\nWhen the epicardial clip is chosen, care must be taken under direct vision\nwhen applying it to the base of the LAA, keeping the stump < 10 mm, but\navoiding the circumflex coronary artery. The application of AtriClip®\nshould preferably be done with the LA open because the LAA will be\ndecompressed, facilitating its application [ 15 ] ( Figure 3 ).\n\nRight Atrial Lesion (R)\n\nRight atrial ablation is performed by creating six lesions with the aim of\ncreating a complete line of blockade from the superior vena cava (SVC) to the\ninferior vena cava (IVC) connecting this line to the native non-conducting\ntissue of the tricuspid annulus (TA) and this, in turn, to the right atrial\nappendage (RAA).\n\nThe ablation lines are as follows:\n\nR1: Right atriotomy\n\nThe right atriotomy should be oriented relatively perpendicular to the axis\nof the SVC and IVC. The atriotomy, being transmural, is electrically\nnonconductive ( Figure 4 ).\n\nR2-3: Lesions of vena cava\n\nVena caval lesions form a continuous straight line that is perpendicular to\nthe atriotomy connecting the SVC (R2) and the IVC (R3). These lesions are\nplaced as far posterior and lateral as possible to avoid injury to the sinus\nnode. These lesions should extend several centimeters into the vena cava to\nensure that the line begins and ends entirely in electrically nonconductive\ntissue ( Figure 5 ).\n\nR4: Cavotricuspid isthmus line\n\nRight atriotomy (free wall) connecting line to the TA at the two o'clock\nposition relative to the valve. This connecting line anchors the anterior\nright atrial lesions (R1-3) to the electrically inactive tissue of the TA\n( Figure 6 ).\n\nR5: Connecting line from the tricuspid annulus (10 o'clock position) to\nthe right atrial appendage\n\nThis lesion completes the line of block through the right atrium (RA),\nconnecting the TA to the RAA. This lesion prevents rotation of\nmacroreentrant circuits around the RAA and may be particularly important in\npatients with enlarged RA ( Figure\n7 ).\n\nR6: Connecting line of the right atrial appendage to the free wall of the\nright atrium\n\nAdditional lesion of the base of the RAA to the free wall of the RAA on the\naortic side of the RAA to avoid the sinoatrial node.\n\nCox-Maze IV by Right Minithoracotomy\n\nIn isolated AF, there is an increasing trend toward minimally invasive SA. The\ncomplete set of CM-IV lesions can be performed through a right minithoracotomy\nwith cannulation of the femoral vessels for cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). In\nevaluating patients for minithoracotomy, preoperative transesophageal\nechocardiography is mandatory to rule out contraindications, including left\natrial or LAA thrombus, giant LA, or mitral regurgitation. Other\ncontraindications include lung disease that precludes one-lung ventilation,\ncoronary artery disease, prior cardiac surgery, and dense pleural adhesions. In\nthe presence of these contraindications, open SA is mandatory [ 1 , 9 , 16 ] .\n\nAccess Route\n\nA 4 - 5 cm anterolateral minithoracotomy is performed at the third\nintercostal space (IS). The camera port is positioned at the second IS in\nthe anterior axillary line. The right pericardium is opened at least 2 cm\nabove the phrenic pedicle to avoid nerve injury. Heparin is administered and\nCPB is started. The aorta is cross-clamped and cardioplegic solution is\ninfused antegrade. The LA is opened widely toward the oblique sinus and\nextended toward the CS to shorten the distance between the bottom of the\nincision and the mitral annulus [ 9 , 16 ] ( Figure\n8 ).\n\nLeft Atrial Lesion Set\n\nMitral isthmus line (including coronary sinus)\n\nA BRF articulating forceps is inserted through the left atriotomy with the\ninner jaw directed toward the mitral annulus, crossing the CS epicardially.\nThis line should be adapted to the coronary anatomy. In left dominance, the\nablation should be directed toward the posteromedial commissure of the\nmitral valve, whereas in right dominance, this line is directed toward the\nP2 - P3 junction. Alternatively, a cryoprobe is positioned in the epicardium\nat the level of the CS, overlapping the anterior line of the radiofrequency\nlesion. A blue marker is used to highlight the endocardial end of the\ncryotherapy lesion. This helps complete the endocardial ablation line of the\nmitral annulus posteriorly ( Figure\n9 ).\n\nLeft atrial isolation (“box lesion”)\n\nFrom the inferior border of the left atriotomy, the lower jaw of the BRF\nforceps is advanced towards the posterior wall of the LA while the upper jaw\nis introduced into the LAA ostium, thus creating the ablation line of the\nleft atrial “floor”. Similarly, the lower jaw is positioned at the level of\nthe transversus while the upper jaw is advanced from the superior border of\nthe left atriotomy into the LAA ostium, automatically excluding the left PVs\nand the posterior aspect of the LA, thus creating the ablation line of the\nleft atrial “roof” ( Figure 10 ).\n\nLeft atrial appendage occlusion\n\nWith the RA fully collapsed, the aorta is elevated and the LAA exposed\nthrough the transverse sinus. A running 4-0 Prolene® suture at the\ncrest level helps to pull the appendage into the exclusion device\n(AtriClip® Pro 2). The LAA is then gently mobilized and accommodated\nuntil the AtriClip® reaches the base of the LAA ( Figure 11 ).\n\nRight Atrial Lesion Set\n\nRight atriotomy\n\nThe RA is opened 1 cm away from and parallel to the right atrioventricular\ngroove. This reduces the distance to the TA.\n\nIntercaval line\n\nA purse-string suture is placed near the Waterston Groove, and through a\nsmall incision in the center of the purse, the BRF forceps are introduced\ntoward the SVC with the jaws directed toward the posterior wall to avoid the\nsinus node. The jaws of the BRF forceps are then inverted and passed along\nthe inferior edge of the right atriotomy toward the IVC, completing the\n“intercaval line” ( Figure 12 ).\n\nCavotricuspid isthmus line\n\nThe cryoprobe is inserted through the superior border of the right atriotomy\nand advanced until it reaches the TA at the one to two o'clock position\n(tricuspid isthmus) ( Figure 13 ).\n\nConnection line of the free wall of the right atrium with the atrial\nappendage\n\nThe BRF clamp is inserted through the upper end of the right atriotomy,\nadvanced toward the tip of the RAA, completing the set of right atrial\nlesions ( Figure 14 ).\n\nRESULTS\n\nThe results of SA depend on specific criteria that a lesion must meet to consistently\nand reproducibly block electrical conduction. Even if all CM-IV lesions are made, if\nany of them do not meet these criteria, the CM-IV as a whole may be incomplete and\nineffective. Fortunately, these criteria are simple and are as follows:\n\nIn Brazil, SA has been widely studied since the late 1990s and has presented\nprogressively better results as diagnostic advances and ablation technologies are\nintroduced that allow for personalized treatments for patients with AF and expand\ntheir applicability [ 17 - 26 ] .\n\nStudies such as those by Ruaengsri et al. demonstrate the safety and efficacy of\nCM-IV as the gold standard procedure for the treatment of AF with an AF-free success\nrate of 91% at six months and 93% at 12 months. These authors also demonstrated\nsuperiority of CM-IV compared to previous techniques with shorter surgery time,\nlower complication rate, reduced hospital stay and significant reduction in the risk\nof postoperative stroke [ 12 ] .\n\nMcCarthy and Cox (2024) found similar results with concomitant SA in patients\nundergoing mitral valve surgery with a 92% AF freedom rate at 12 months and 82% at\n36 months and a 33% reduction in stroke risk after LAA occlusion [ 15 ] . These findings allowed\nthe authors to conclude that concomitant SA of AF associated with LAA occlusion\nreduces the risk of stroke, heart failure, and late mortality, especially in\npatients undergoing mitral valve surgery.\n\nMalaisrie et al., in turn, evaluated the late results of AF ablation performed during\nCABG in a cohort of 34,600 Medicare patients linked to the STS database, 10,541\n(30.5%) of whom had preoperative AF and received concomitant ablation. In this\nstudy, after two years of follow-up, there was a clear benefit for the group that\nreceived ablation, with lower mortality (29.9% vs. 37.1%, P = 0.0358) and incidence of stroke/embolism (9.9% vs. 12.0%, P = 0.0006) [ 27 ] . Based on these\nresults, the authors concluded that AF ablation concomitant with CABG was able to\nreduce the risk of mortality and thromboembolic events in long-term survivors (>\n2 years) and should be recommended in patients with preoperative AF who present an\nacceptable perioperative risk.\n\nRegarding the access route, MacGregor et al. found similar efficacy in SA performed\nby a minimally invasive approach (right mini thoracotomy) compared with median\nsternotomy [ 28 ] . In both access routes, the most important aspect seems\nto be the electrical isolation of the LA (“box lesion”). In the study by Robertson\net al., the inclusion of the “box lesion” significantly increased the success rate\nof ablation when compared with isolation of the PVs alone (96% vs. 86%) [ 9 ] .\n\nIn general, SA has been shown to be a beneficial and safe procedure. The 2023\nClinical Practice Guidelines from the STS highlight the proven benefits of the CM-IV\nprocedure: improved survival and quality of life and a lower incidence of stroke and\nthromboembolism in the long term. As potential complications, the guidelines\nhighlight that ablation may increase the risks of renal dysfunction and the need for\na permanent pacemaker (< 5%), but it does not increase overall\nmortality [ 10 ] .\n\nFINAL CONSIDERATIONS\n\nThe CM-IV technique is particularly indicated for patients with symptomatic AF who\nrequire other concomitant cardiac surgeries, such as valve repair, or for those with\nAF refractory to medications and catheter ablation. It is also recommended for\npatients at high risk of stroke, especially in cases where anticoagulation is not\nfeasible. Including LAA management in the procedure is a crucial component, as it\nsignificantly reduces the risk of thrombosis and embolic events.\n\nIn conclusion, the CM-IV technique represents a milestone in the treatment of AF,\ncombining safety, efficacy, and long-term benefits. Its wider adoption is essential\nto transform the most severe stages of patients' health, especially in countries\nsuch as Brazil, where the prevalence of AF is significant, and the risks associated\nwith this condition severely impact public health. Expanding access to this\ninnovative approach is a crucial step towards improving quality of life and reducing\nserious complications in patients with AF.",
