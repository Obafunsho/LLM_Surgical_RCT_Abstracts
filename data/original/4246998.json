  "title": "Surgical Results of the Carotid Occlusion Surgery Study",
  "abstract": "Object: The Carotid Occlusion Surgery Study (COSS) was conducted to determine if STA-MCA bypass, when added to best medical therapy, would reduce subsequent ipsilateral stroke in patients with complete ICA occlusion and an elevated OEF in the cerebral hemisphere distal to the carotid occlusion. A recent publication reported the methodology of COSS in detail and briefly outlined the major findings of the trial. 29 The surgical results of COSS are described in detail in this report.\n\nMethods: The Carotid Occlusion Surgery Study (COSS) was a parallel group, prospective, 1:1 randomized, open-label, blinded-adjudication treatment trial. Participants with angiographic confirmed complete occlusion of the ICA causing either a transient ischemic attack (TIA) or ischemic stroke within 120 days and hemodynamic cerebral ischemia demonstrated by an increased oxygen extraction fraction (OEF) measured by positron emission tomography (PET) were randomized to either surgical or medical treatment. The surgical patients underwent a STA-MCA cortical branch anastomosis. One hundred and ninety-five patients were randomized: 97 to the surgical group and 98 to the medical group.\n\nResults: In the intention-to-treat analysis, the two-year rates of the primary endpoint were 0.210 for the surgical group and 0.227 for the medical group (p=0.78, log rank). Fourteen (15%) of the 93 patients who had an STA-MCA arterial bypass had an endpoint ipsilateral hemispheric stroke in the 30 day peri-operative period, 12 within two days. The STA-MCA arterial bypass patency rate was 98% at the 30 day post-operative visit and 96% at the last follow-up examination. STA-MCA arterial bypass markedly improved, although it did not normalize, the level of elevated OEF in the symptomatic cerebral hemisphere. Five operated patients and one non-operated patient in the surgical group had an endpoint ipsilateral hemispheric stroke after the 30 day peri-operative period. No baseline characteristics or intra-operative variables were identified that permitted the identification of those who would experience a procedure related stroke.\n\nConclusions: In spite of excellent bypass graft patency and improved cerebral hemodynamics, STA-MCA anastomosis did not provide an overall benefit on ipsilateral two-year stroke recurrence, mainly due to a much better than expected stroke recurrence rate (22.7%) in the medical group in the trial, but also because of a significant peri-operative stroke rate (15%).",
