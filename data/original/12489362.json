  "title": "Adherence to prehabilitation in adult surgical patients: a systematic review, meta-analysis, meta-regression, and qualitative synthesis",
  "abstract": "Background: Prehabilitation is hypothesised to play an important role in optimising postoperative outcomes. However, achieving high adherence can be challenging. Our objectives were to synthesise current approaches to adherence measurement and reporting, estimate prehabilitation adherence across trials, identify procedural-, programme-, or patient-level factors associated with adherence, and report barriers and facilitators to adherence.\n\nMethods: Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, the CINAHL, PsycINFO, Web of Science, and the Cochrane CENTRAL Register of Controlled Trials were searched from inception until April 10, 2024. We included randomised trials of adults undergoing major elective surgery allocated to a prehabilitation programme, with at least one binary or continuous measure of adherence to prehabilitation, to an individual component, or both. Random-effects meta-analysis pooled overall adherence rates; meta-regression evaluated predictors of adherence. Qualitative synthesis of reported barriers and facilitators was informed by the Theoretical Domains Framework.\n\nResults: We screened 11 652 titles and abstracts, followed by 1232 full texts, and included 105 trials ( n =4941). Pooled adherence was 79% (95% confidence interval [CI] 70–88; I 2 =95.4%). Substantial qualitative and statistical heterogeneity existed in defining prehabilitation adherence. Only patient age was significantly associated with adherence (per year older: odds ratio 0.95 [95% CI 0.91–0.99]). Based on qualitative synthesis, common barriers were logistical issues and health conditions; facilitators included supervision by specialists and personalisation.\n\nConclusions: Prehabilitation adherence metrics are variable across trials and standardisation is required to improve reporting and interpretation of prehabilitation evidence. Little credible evidence identifies factors associated with adherence; however, qualitative barriers and facilitators could inform programme design and implementation.\n\nSystematic review protocol: PROSPERO (CRD42024518851).",

  "full_text": "Methods\n\nProtocol and registration\n\nThis was a systematic review, meta-analysis and -regression, and qualitative synthesis of RCTs, designed according to best practice recommendations. 13 Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines guided reporting ( Supplementary Appendix 1 ), along with the Guidance for Reporting Involvement of Patients and the Public-2 (GRIPP-2; Supplementary Appendix 2 ). 14 , 15 This study is part of an overarching prehabilitation knowledge synthesis programme. This study’s specific protocol was independently developed and prospectively registered on March 11, 2024 (CRD42024518851).\n\nPatient and public involvement\n\nDesign, conduct, and interpretation of this study was informed by patient partners (including on the study executive [GK]) and other knowledge users with lived experience providing, delivering, and studying prehabilitation and perioperative care. Partnership was promoted through integrated knowledge translation 16 , 17 via direct engagement, surveys, emails, and team meetings ( Supplementary Appendix 2 ).\n\nSearch strategy\n\nOur search strategy ( Supplementary Appendix 3 ) was developed with our team’s information specialist, underwent independent peer review, 18 and was applied to MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Web of Science, and the Cochrane CENTRAL Register (inception to April 10, 2024). No language exclusions were applied. Grey literature was searched. The references of included studies were also screened.\n\nEligibility criteria\n\nWe included RCTs addressing a population of adults (≥18 yr) undergoing elective surgery allocated to a prehabilitation programme, consisting of one or more components (e.g. exercise, nutrition, psychosocial, cognitive), and that reported at least one binary or continuous measure of overall adherence to prehabilitation, adherence to each individual component, or both. We excluded studies where prehabilitation was offered for <7 days before surgery, 2 and quasi-experimental or nonrandomised designs.\n\nStudy selection\n\nTitle and abstract, and full-text screening were completed independently in duplicate and piloted on a set of four citations by each reviewer. Citations with conflict between reviewers or marked as unsure were reviewed by the senior author (DIM). The screening process was conducted using DistillerSR® (Evidence Partners Inc., Ottawa, ON, Canada).\n\nData extraction and risk of bias assessment\n\nTwo investigators (MBV, ICM) independently extracted data in duplicate using a pilot data extraction form designed specifically for this study; 10 studies were piloted for each extractor (Microsoft Excel®; Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, WA, USA). The senior author (DIM) reviewed accuracy and resolved discrepancies. For each study, we extracted pre-specified variables specific to study, procedural, programme, and population characteristics. Any missing data were sought from study authors via e-mail. The Cochrane Risk of Bias 1 (RoB 1.0 ) tool 19 was applied in duplicate (MA, AB, DIM) to assess within-study bias of the included evidence. Disagreements were resolved by discussion with the senior investigator (DIM). We collected all measures of adherence and associated measures of variance, using described methods 20 to estimate mean and standard deviation from related measures (e.g. medians, interquartile range [IQR], or range).\n\nEffect modifiers\n\nFrom each included study reporting a measure of prehabilitation adherence, we extracted prehabilitation programme, surgical procedural, and population characteristics. A full list of all pre-specified effect modifiers is provided in Supplementary Appendix 4 .\n\nOutcomes\n\nOur primary outcome was any reported measure of adherence to a prehabilitation intervention (continuous or dichotomous). Continuous measures represented the proportion of all prehabilitation tasks completed. Binary measures represented the proportion of individuals meeting a pre-specified threshold (either explicitly described, or based on per-protocol definitions). Where both a continuous and dichotomised measure of adherence were reported, we collected the continuous measure.\n\nSecondary outcomes were any reported barriers or facilitators to prehabilitation adherence. These outcomes were extracted as direct text quotations from the study manuscripts.\n\nData syntheses and analyses\n\nDescriptive statistics were used to summarise the overall types of prehabilitation programmes, surgical, and population characteristics. Quantitative syntheses addressed data from studies reporting continuous and binary measures of adherence. A two-sided alpha of 0.05 was used for all analyses. The I 2 statistic was used to quantify the percentage of variability across study effect estimates owing to between-study heterogeneity. 21\n\nMeta-analysis\n\nRandom-effects inverse variance meta-analysis was used for all pooled analyses (‘ metafor ’ package; R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria), 22 with confidence intervals (CIs) for the summary effect calculated with the Hartung–Knapp–Sidik–Jonkman method, between-study variance estimated using the restricted maximum likelihood method, and estimation of prediction intervals. 23 , 24 As both continuous and binary adherence measures were proportions, we estimated pooled adherence and within-component mean adherence, along with 95% CIs using the ‘ metaprop’ function with a logit transformation.\n\nMeta-regression\n\nWhere at least 10 studies were available reporting a pre-specified effect modifier, we performed meta-regression (‘ meta’ package ) to estimate the summary univariable association (mean difference and 95% CI [continuous]; odds ratio [OR] and 95% CI [binary]) of the effect modifier with adherence, and the associated R 2 statistic as a measure of heterogeneity in adherence explained by the postulated effect modifier. We assessed the credibility of significant effect modifiers using the Instrument to assess the Credibility of Effect Modification Analyses (ICEMAN) in a meta-analysis of RCTs. 25\n\nDescriptive and qualitative analyses\n\nFrom each study reporting adherence, we extracted any text describing how adherence was defined and qualitatively synthesised common approaches.\n\nTo synthesise barriers and facilitators, two reviewers (MBV, ICM) assessed an initial set of 10 studies and inductively developed codes to describe common textual references that either explicitly described a barrier or facilitator to adherence, or that described factors that acted as barriers or facilitators, even if such factors were not explicitly described in the study using barrier/facilitator language. With this set of codes, reviewers then coded subsequent study reports to generate an overall frequency count for each code. If new codes were proposed by one reviewer, the two reviewers again met to find agreement. Codes and frequency counts were then reviewed with the senior author (DM) and consensus used to determine if codes represented a single theme, or if some codes could be combined into larger themes. We then deductively mapped themes to at least one domain of the Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF), 26 a leading framework informing implementation and behaviour change in health care across 14 domains. 26 , 27 Where available, quotes were extracted to support themes.\n\nProtocol amendments\n\nProtocol deviations are reported in Supplementary Appendix 5 .\n\nResults\n\nStudy selection and characteristics of included studies\n\nAfter screening 11 652 titles and abstracts, followed by 1232 full texts, we included 105 trials ( n =4941 participants allocated to prehabilitation) published between 2000 and 2024; 20% ( n =220) of excluded studies met inclusion criteria but did not report adherence data (PRISMA Diagram, Supplementary Appendix 1 ; included studies, Table 1 ; excluded studies, Supplementary Appendix 6 ). Overall, 76 (72.4%) studies reported adherence as continuous measure, whereas 29 (27.6%) studies reported adherence as a binary outcome. Most studies ( n =76; 72.4%) reported adherence to exercise (continuous n =55; binary n =21), followed by 27 (25.7%) nutrition studies (continuous n =20; binary n =7). Eight studies addressed adherence to a psychosocial intervention (continuous n =7; binary n =1) and only two to a cognitive component (continuous n =1; binary n =1).\n\nFor studies reporting adherence as a continuous measure, 32.5% ( n =1606) of participants underwent oncological surgery and 17.5% ( n =865) orthopaedic surgery. Median age was 65 yr and 53.6% of participants were female. For studies reporting adherence as a binary measure, 26.6% ( n =1316) underwent oncological surgery and 2.4% ( n =121) orthopaedic surgery. Median age was 64 yr and 49.6% of participants were female. Overall, most studies ( n =77; 73.3%) were high risk of bias, 19 (18.1%) had unclear risk of bias, and nine (8.6%) were rated as low risk of bias. Factors contributing to high risk of bias were lack of blinding of participants, personnel, and standard care of participants ( Supplementary Appendix 7 ).\n\nAdherence definitions\n\nOf included studies, 65 (61.9%) provided explicit definitions of adherence, which were heterogeneous. Adherence was most often reported by component ( n =100; 95.2%). Five studies (4.8%) reported multicomponent adherence. Methods used to ascertain adherence were reported in 61 studies, with 20 (32.8%) using logbooks only, five (8.2%) using phone calls only, and 36 (59%) using combined methods, typically logbooks plus phone calls.\n\nOf the 72 studies reporting adherence to exercise interventions, 33 (45.8%) defined adherence based on completion of prescribed exercise, whereas 24 (33.3%) defined adherence based on attendance at exercise sessions. For studies that dichotomised exercise adherence definitions, the median threshold defining adherence was 75% (IQR 75–100).\n\nOf the 27 studies reporting adherence to nutritional interventions, 17 (63%) definitions were based on patient self-report of supplement consumption, and three (11%) were based on verification of supplement consumption by the research team. The median threshold to define adherence was 75% (IQR 70–100).\n\nOverall adherence to prehabilitation interventions\n\nFrom studies reporting any type of adherence as a continuous measure, the pooled mean adherence was 79% (95% CI 70–88; I 2 =95.4%; Fig. 1 ). For exercise interventions, the pooled mean adherence was 85% (95% CI 80–89; I 2 =64%). For nutrition interventions, pooled mean adherence was 83% (95% CI 74–89; I 2 =73%).\n\nWhere studies reported adherence using a threshold, the overall proportion achieving adherence was 80% (95% CI 73–86; I 2 =89%; Fig. 2 ). For exercise interventions, 74% (95% CI 63–82; I 2 =88%) achieved adherence, whereas for nutrition, 85% (95% CI 76–91; I 2 =76%) achieved adherence.\n\nPredictors of adherence\n\nMean adherence to prehabilitation (continuous)\n\nAcross all types of prehabilitation interventions, no procedural-, programme-, or patient-level factors were significantly associated with mean adherence to prehabilitation. Only programme supervision (17%) explained more than 10% of observed heterogeneity ( Table 2 ).\n\nProportion adherent to prehabilitation (binary)\n\nAmong postulated programme-, procedural-, and patient-level effect modifiers, only patient age was significantly associated with the odds of adherence to prehabilitation (per year older: OR 0.95 [95% CI 0.91–0.99]; R 2 =13.30%, P =0.025; low credibility; Supplementary Appendix 8 ). Only age (13%), surgery type (14%), and programme personalisation ( vs none: 12%) explained more than 10% of observed heterogeneity ( Table 3 ).\n\nBarriers and facilitators to adherence to prehabilitation\n\nBased on qualitative synthesis, we identified 10 barriers and facilitators themes, which were mapped to nine of 14 TDF domains. Frequency counts and supporting quotes are presented in Supplementary Appendix 9 .\n\nTheme 1: health condition\n\nFor exercise adherence, acute and chronic medical conditions (e.g. colds, flu, exacerbation of chronic pulmonary disease) were reported as barriers. Symptom burden, such as fatigue and pain, also arose as barriers. For nutritional adherence, gastrointestinal side-effects decreased adherence to supplement consumption.\n\nTheme 2: personal factors\n\nAcross types of prehabilitation, personal feelings of being overwhelmed, anxiety, and time constraints were identified as barriers. For cognitive prehabilitation, some participants expressed challenges with focus, and completing numerous assigned tasks in a timely manner.\n\nTheme 3: logistical issues\n\nLogistical issues were common barriers, including a lack of access to transport for participants in hospital-based exercise programmes, and lack of technology access for cognitive prehabilitation participants. For participants receiving nutritional supplements, having to wait to receive supplements at a pharmacy was a barrier.\n\nTheme 4: social influences\n\nLack of family or social support was the most common social barrier. Social isolation and lack of family support, competing family or social commitments, and work responsibilities impeded adherence to prehabilitation. Conversely, exercise engagement was facilitated by the presence of a support person (e.g. spouse, family member), especially if they participated in training with the participant.\n\nTheme 5: supervision by specialists\n\nFull or partial supervision was a facilitator of adherence to exercise and nutrition (e.g. dietitians or physiotherapists following individual progression). Participants expressed feeling cared for when their exercise was supervised, and interaction with a coach represented an important social contact for individuals living alone. Supervision also helped to make exercise programmes more manageable.\n\nTheme 6: training locations including home-based programmes\n\nExercise programmes delivered at home facilitated adherence and helped to overcome barriers to transportation expressed by some participants.\n\nTheme 7: personalisation\n\nIntervention personalisation was a facilitator. Approaches to personalisation included informing programming using baseline functional status (either self-reported, or quantified using exercise testing), and health history (e.g. comorbidities and pain conditions). Other approaches included individualised strategies to manage exercise-related pain symptoms, and providing recipe tips and additives to improve the palatability of nutritional supplements.\n\nTheme 8: adequate access to materials, supplements, and equipment\n\nHaving adequate and patient-friendly programme materials (e.g. instructional booklet or video) was a facilitator to exercise adherence, as was the use of activity trackers such as pedometers and heart rate monitors. For nutritional supplements, providing supplements along with shaker jugs (to mix protein powders with liquids) improved adherence. Provision of a tablet-based brain-training application facilitated cognitive prehabilitation adherence.\n\nTheme 9: resources to support engagement and motivation\n\nProviding education, skill building, and supporting intrinsic motivation facilitated adherence. For example, implementing structured education about stress and anxiety management, decreasing fear avoidance behaviours, resilience profiling, goal setting, and re-enforcing the positive effects of exercise were mentioned as enablers.\n\nDiscussion\n\nIn this systematic review, meta-analysis, meta-regression, and qualitative synthesis, we identified substantial quantitative, statistical, and operational heterogeneity in adherence definitions in prehabilitation RCTs and the extent to which intervention adherence was achieved. Although we estimate that participants in prehabilitation trials typically complete 85% of prescribed intervention activities, and that 80% meet defined thresholds, heterogeneity in adherence was high and 20% of identified trials did not report adherence. Despite pre-specifying a set of procedural-, programme-, and patient-level factors, only increased patient age was associated with adherence (decreased), and this estimate had low credibility. In contrast, several qualitative barriers and facilitators to adherence were identified and aligned with many postulated predictors. Together, these findings highlight the need to clearly and consistently report adherence using standardised methods along with standardised reporting of key patient and programme characteristics. Identified barriers and facilitators could be used to enhance design and implementation of prehabilitation programmes.\n\nDespite being a top priority in prehabilitation science, 11 our results indicate that measurement and reporting of prehabilitation adherence is variable. Variation existed in whether adherence was reported, with 20% of eligible studies excluded for not reporting adherence. Where adherence was reported, studies often did not provide a definition, used definitions that were based on attendance (as opposed to completion of prescribed interventions), and typically relied on self-report. Many studies reported adherence dichotomously as opposed to reporting a more information-rich continuous measure. As prehabilitation research continues to be prioritised by patients, the public, and clinicians, efforts are warranted to develop consensus guidelines and definitions for adherence measurement and reporting. Ideally, this process would meaningfully engage patients, clinicians, researchers, and other interest holders to ensure a meaningful and balanced set of recommendations. Fortunately, where reported, available data suggested that high levels of adherence can be achieved, which aligns with recent knowledge synthesis reporting consistent benefit from prehabilitation in improving clinical outcomes. 8 However, these promising adherence levels should be considered in context of the underlying trials, which were mostly single centre with high or unclear risk of bias.\n\nAdherence demonstrated statistical heterogeneity, with I 2 values for pooled estimates exceeding 70% in all meta-analyses, including those limited to a single component (e.g. exercise only). This likely reflects inconsistency across adherence definitions, and variations in prehabilitation programmes, surgical procedures, and patient characteristics. A lack of strong associations could have several explanations, including heterogeneity in how factors were measured and reported within trials, or our use of aggregate (i.e. study-level) variables, in contrast to individual patient data. 28 A lack of consistent reporting of factors including frailty, malnutrition, and comorbidity precluded their analysis, which previous trials suggest are likely important modifiers of prehabilitation adherence. 9 , 29\n\nOur qualitative synthesis identified consistent themes. Several barriers were related to patient-level factors, including acute and chronic medical conditions, the presence of anxiety, a lack of social support, and lack of time to complete prehabilitation tasks. At a programme level, logistical considerations, such as accessing facility-based programmes, were barriers, whereas provision of home-based programming facilitated adherence. Although supervision further facilitated adherence, advancing virtual technology, including incorporation of wearable sensors, will likely be required to provide home-based programming with adequate supervision and could help to quantify adherence with greater precision. As the field continues to develop, use of innovative designs such as Sequential, Multiple Assignment, Randomised Trial (SMART) designs could play a role in advancing intervention design to optimise adherence. 30 Briefly, SMART designs are multistage, factorial randomised trials where participants can be randomised at multiple points. In the setting of prehabilitation, this could allow participants to undergo sequential, adaptive testing of promising adherence optimisation strategies over the course of their enrolment dependent on their adherence levels.\n\nStrengths and limitations\n\nOur review involved patient and public engagement from inception to reporting. Our peer-reviewed search included six databases, all the stages of the review were performed in duplicate, and no language restrictions were applied. Limitations include heterogeneity in pooled adherence definitions and pooled estimates. Adherence to psychosocial and cognitive components was poorly reported. Although inclusion was limited to RCTs, stratified randomisation of predictors in RCTs was not conducted; therefore, confounding (e.g. the association of other or unmeasured factors with adherence) in our estimated associations was possible. Reported barriers and facilitators were extracted based on data that typically lacked direct participant perspective.\n\nConclusions\n\nAdherence to prehabilitation is generally high; however, reporting quality and adherence definitions are heterogeneous. Although only age was identified as a significant predictor of adherence, a lack of reporting of key patient characteristics such as frailty limits certainty. Future interventions and implementation programmes should aim to overcome logistical and social support-related barriers while optimising delivery of home-based interventions with adequate supervision and material support.\n\nAuthors’ contributions\n\nConception of the work: DIM, GK\n\nConception, interpretation, and review: GK\n\nDesign of the work and data interpretation: DIM, MBV, EH, GK, BH, DMW, ML, SB, CG\n\nData acquisition: DIM, MBV, ICM, MA, AB, KB\n\nData analysis: DIM\n\nWriting and review of the manuscript: DIM, MBV, GK\n\nFunding\n\nCanadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR) grant number 202109PJK by DIM; Department of Anesthesiology & Pain Medicine at The Ottawa Hospital provided access to DistillerSR software.\n\nDeclaration of interest\n\nDIM receives salary support from a Clinical Research Chair at the University of Ottawa Faculty of Medicine , from the Physician Services Inc.
