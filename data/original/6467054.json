  "title": "Does Race Influence Risk Assessment and Recommendations for Lung Resection? A Randomized Trial",
  "abstract": "Background.: Racial disparities in use of surgical therapy for lung cancer exist in the United States. Videos of standardized patients (SPs) can help identify factors that influence physicians’ surgical risk estimation. We hypothesized that physician race and SP race in videos influence surgeon decision making.\n\nMethods.: Four race-neutral clinical vignettes representing lung resection candidates were paired with risk-level concordant short silent videos of SPs. Vignette/video combinations were classified as low or high risk. Trainees and practicing thoracic surgeons read a race-neutral vignette, provided an initial estimate of the percentage risk of major surgical complications, viewed a video randomized to a black or white SP, provided a final estimate of risk, and scored the likelihood that they would recommend operative therapy. Changes in risk estimates were assessed.\n\nResults.: Participants included 113 surgeons (38 practicing surgeons, 75 trainees); of these, 76 were white non-Hispanic (67%), and 37 were other self-identified racial categories. Percentage changes between initial and final risk estimates were not significantly related to patient race ( p = 0.11) or surgeon race (white versus other; p = 0.52). Videos of black SPs were associated with a similar likelihood of recommending an operation compared with that of videos of white SPs ( p = 0.90). Physician race (white versus other) was not related to the likelihood of recommending surgical intervention ( p = 0.79).\n\nConclusions.: Neither patient nor physician race was significantly associated with risk estimation or surgical recommendations. These findings do not provide an explanation for documented racial disparities in lung cancer therapy. Further investigation is needed to identify the mechanism underlying these disparities.",
