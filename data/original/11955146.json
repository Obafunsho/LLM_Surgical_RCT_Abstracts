  "full_text": "Background\n\nSevere traumatic injuries are responsible for 4.4 million deaths worldwide each year, which represents 8% of all deaths [ 1 ]. Hemorrhage accounts for 35–40% of these deaths, making it the second leading cause of death from trauma after direct injury to the central nervous system [ 2 ]. Death from hemorrhage is a rapid process that occurs quickly after the initial trauma, before the patient has had a chance to reach a hospital. Therefore, management must be rapid, with interventions that do not delay surgery. These procedures focus on stopping external bleeding and include extensive use of hemostatic dressings and tourniquets, with constant concern for their re-evaluation [ 3 ]; early aggressive hypothermia control; use of the antifibrinolytic agent tranexamic acid; early management of hypocalcemia; and protocolized use of blood transfusions. This is known as the damage control strategy [ 4 ]. However, the issue of time remains a primary consideration. The time to reach a hospital remains an independent factor in mortality, even in high-income countries [ 5 ].\n\nWithout questioning the principles of damage control, the development of effective, easy-to-use, adjuvant treatments to improve the survival of casualties appears to be necessary. Many researchers are currently conducting studies of transfusion therapies to enhance existing blood products or develop alternatives [ 6 , 7 ]. Counteracting coagulopathy or the inflammatory processes associated with severe trauma are other promising strategies [ 8 , 9 ]. Another avenue of research is to improve cell survival during tissue hypoxia, which occurs in hemorrhagic shock (HS). During HS, the oxygen supply to cells decreases and, despite increased oxygen extraction, anaerobic metabolism sets in, leading to acidosis, coagulopathy, apoptosis, and organ dysfunction [ 10 ]. In this review, we focus on molecules that could help cells cope with this situation and be used in adjuvant treatments for the initial resuscitation of severe trauma patients.\n\nMethodology\n\nWe performed a review of the literature using the PubMed scientific database using the MeSH terms “Shock, Hemorrhagic/drug therapy.” The search yielded 864 articles published since the year 2000. We refined the search by excluding articles dealing with medical devices, and then further narrowed it down by excluding articles on transfusion therapy, steroid treatment, or that specifically targeted coagulation improvement or inflammation. The studies specifically focusing on management of traumatic brain injury were also excluded, although those addressing it in the context of HS were considered. We selected molecules specifically studied in the context of HS that promote cell survival during tissue hypoxia and can be used in the pre-hospital setting. We then met to select six molecules that we deemed suitable for future human clinical trials in HS given the preclinical results already obtained in animals, particularly those that have a demonstrated effect on survival. We chose niacin, thiazolidinediones, prolyl hydroxylase domain inhibitors (PHDis), O-GlcNAcylation, valproic acid (VPA), and adenosine–lidocaine–magnesium (ALM) solution. We then searched the scientific database PubMed and ClinicalTrials.gov for these six molecules and, to be exhaustive, cross-referenced the references of the initially selected articles. We have included data from preclinical work on animal models through to human research.\n\nResults\n\nEnhancing mitochondrial function\n\nAs the organelle responsible for producing cellular energy, mitochondria are the first to be affected by hypoxia. This results in a rapid decline in adenosine triphosphate (ATP) levels, an increase in reactive oxygen species, and the leakage of mitochondrial proteins into the cytoplasm, which ultimately leads to apoptosis [ 11 ]. In severely ill patients in septic shock, muscle biopsies have shown an association between mitochondrial dysfunction, as assessed by levels of reduced glutathione, and mortality [ 12 ]. Conversely, activation of mitochondrial biogenesis in such patients is associated with improved survival [ 13 ]. Although not as well studied in severe bleeding as it is in septic shock, mitochondrial dysfunction appears to play an important role in the pathophysiology of HS [ 14 ]. Therefore, improving mitochondrial function in the acute phase is an area of research for the management of severe trauma [ 10 ].\n\nNiacin (Table 1 )\n\nBiological rationale\n\nNiacin is the precursor of pyrimidine nucleotides nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD), including NAD + and the reduced form NADH, and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP), including NADP + and the reduced form NADPH. More than 500 redox reactions depend on these molecules, including mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation and glycolysis. The NAD concentration is known to decrease in cells during HS [ 20 ]. Therefore, the hypothesis that intake of niacin or its derivatives could improve survival was tested.\n\nSummary of preclinical works\n\nPretreatment with nicotinamide mononucleotide, an NAD precursor derived from niacin, in rats exposed to HS results in a decrease in interleukin 6 (IL-6) and venous lactates, and in the preservation of mitochondrial respiration assessed by high-resolution respirometry. All of these results are accompanied by an increase in survival, even when treatment is administered after initiation of HS [ 16 – 18 ]. Mitochondrial activity is restored, as evidenced by improvement in the NAD/NADH ratio and sirtuin 1 activity in cardiac cells, and the inflammatory response, notably the NF-κB pathway, is inhibited [ 16 , 17 ].\n\nNiacin also exerts its own action by binding to receptors expressed on immune cells, notably Gpr109a (also known as HCA2), thereby mediating anti-inflammatory effects [ 21 ]. The pathway of this receptor seems to contribute to the beneficial effect of niacin in HS [ 16 ].\n\nA study on cardiac arrest reported a better rate of return of spontaneous circulation in mice treated with the amide form of niacin, nicotinamide, and improved cardiomyocyte contractility with nicotinamide in vitro [ 19 ]. Niacin has also shown interesting results in HS in combination with other molecules, such as niacin-dichloroacetate-resveratrol, with increased survival in the absence of resuscitation and at lower doses than if each drug was administered individually [ 15 ].\n\nUse in humans\n\nNiacin is a long-known vitamin referred to as vitamin B3 or PP (pellagra preventive). Its deficiency is the cause of pellagra, and it was used for its hypolipidemic effect before the discovery of statins. Niacin is a readily available, inexpensive dietary supplement already approved for use in humans, which could facilitate clinical trials. Niacin has few side effects in routine clinical practice, the most commonly reported being itching, especially of the face [ 22 ]. Toxicity studies are still required before clinical trials can be conducted. The doses utilized in the aforementioned studies (approximately 10 mg/kg intravenously and 300–1000 mg/kg orally) differ from those used in humans. For the treatment of pellagra, the recommended intravenous dose is 500 mg over 24 h. For oral daily intake, progressively increasing from 250 mg is recommended.\n\nThiazolidinediones (or glitazones) (Table 2 )\n\nBiological rationale\n\nThe most documented mechanism of action of thiazolidinediones is to bind peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR-γ), a transcription factor belonging to the nuclear receptor superfamily. The PPAR-γ pathway is involved in inflammatory processes [ 33 ] and plays a role in mitochondrial biogenesis, especially through PPAR-γ co-activator 1 alpha (PGC1α), which is deemed a master regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis [ 34 , 35 ]. Thiazolidinediones have an effect on mitochondrial biogenesis [ 31 , 36 ]. In humans, this is one avenue of research into neurodegenerative diseases [ 34 ]. As improved mitochondrial function could favor cell survival during HS, these compounds have been tested in this context.\n\nSummary of preclinical works\n\nThiazolidinediones appear to have protective effects against ischemia–reperfusion injury during HS. Ciglitazone reduces apoptosis markers in the liver and lungs during HS in rats [ 24 , 25 ]. The same results were obtained with 15d-PGJ2, another PPAR-γ receptor ligand [ 26 ]. Finally, in a mouse model of HS, rosiglitazone reduced inflammatory markers TNF-alpha, IL-6, and monocytic chemotactic protein (MCP)-1; decreased organ damage; and, most importantly, improved survival in treated animals [ 23 ].\n\nThe mechanisms underlying the effects of thiazolidinediones are only partially understood [ 37 ]. Certainly, the anti-inflammatory action of thiazolidinediones may play a role in their beneficial effects during HS [ 38 , 39 ], but the potential preservative effect of these compounds on mitochondrial function may also be involved. Thiazolidinediones stimulate biogenesis, but it may not be the primary effect, as it takes hours to be observed [ 34 , 35 ]. Rosiglitazone normalized mitochondrial membrane potential and prevented apoptotic signaling after ischemia–reperfusion injury in an in vitro study [ 32 ]. In addition to HS, PPAR-γ appears to play an important role in the development of ischemia–reperfusion injury in several models, including HS [ 27 , 40 ], and thiazolidinediones have shown protective effects in this context in kidney, liver, brain, and heart tissues [ 27 , 40 , 41 ]. Beneficial effects of these compounds in major bleeding may also be partially mediated by this mechanism.\n\nIn summary, animal models show that Thiazolidinediones may stimulate mitochondrial biogenesis, reduce inflammation, and attenuate ischemia–reperfusion lesions in organs.\n\nUse in humans\n\nThiazolidinediones, chief among which are rosiglitazone and pioglitazone, are products that have already been approved and used for many years, with great tolerance, [ 42 ] to treat type 2 diabetes mellitus because they increase insulin sensitivity. This should facilitate clinical trials in HS. However, there are none at present.\n\nEnhancing the cellular stress response\n\nProlyl hydroxylase domain inhibitors (Table 3 )\n\nBiological rationale\n\nPHDis increase levels of hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs), transcription factors expressed in response to cellular hypoxia. When exposed to hypoxic stress, the cell stabilizes its HIF levels by reducing their degradation, resulting in modulation of the cellular response to hypoxia and facilitating adaptive processes to a lack of oxygen [ 45 ]. HIFs are made up of two subunits. The α subunit is continuously synthesized and degraded by prolyl hydroxylase using oxygen as a cofactor. Therefore, it does not accumulate under normoxic conditions [ 46 , 47 ]. Thus, a PHDi increases the HIF-α levels in the cell by inhibiting prolyl hydroxylase. PHDis have also been shown to act on carbohydrate metabolism by activating neoglucogenesis from lactate in the Cori cycle [ 48 ]. Thus, they could accelerate lactate clearance. The action of PHDis towards HIF-α and lactate levels has led to the hypothesis that these molecules could have a beneficial effect on cellular hypoxia, particularly in the context of HS.\n\nSummary of preclinical works\n\nWu et al. recently conducted an animal experiment using MK-8617, a nonselective PHDi that they administered to rats after the onset of HS [ 43 ]. The treated animals exhibited reduced lactic acidosis, improved hemodynamic parameters, and reduced prothrombin time, in addition to enhanced survival. This survival benefit was maintained after the introduction of whole blood resuscitation, demonstrating the potential value of PHDis as standalone or adjuvant treatment in conventional hemostatic resuscitation. PHDis appear to have very broad clinical potential beyond HS [ 49 ]. In trauma, Li et al. [ 44 ] showed a stimulating effect on spinal cord healing after experimental trauma in which axon regeneration was enhanced.\n\nUse in humans\n\nPHDis were developed for the treatment of anemia in chronic renal failure and anemia resulting from chemotherapy due to their ability to stimulate the secretion of erythropoietin. Their efficacy in this indication has been established, though questions remain regarding their role in clinical practice due to the potential for long-term adverse effects [ 50 ]. In the context of HS, this molecule is not yet in clinical trials. In addition, no parenteral formulation of these compounds is currently available, which may limit their use in the treatment of severe trauma. The potential of these agents to enhance lactate clearance also renders them promising candidates for the treatment of lactic acidosis, including iatrogenic lactic acidosis [ 51 ], but there have been no ongoing clinical trials in this indication.\n\nO-GlcNAcylation (Table 4 )\n\nBiological rationale\n\nO-GlcNAcylation (O-GlcNAc) is a post-translational modification of cytoplasmic, nuclear, and mitochondrial proteins that consists of the addition of a sugar, β- d - N -acetylglucosamine (or GlcNAc), to their serine and threonine residues. O-GlcNAcylation turnover is controlled by a single pair of enzymes: O-linked N -acetylglucosaminyltransferase (O-GlcNAc transferase or OGT) adds the GlcNAc motif to proteins, and O-linked N -acetyl β- d -glucosaminidase (O-GlcNAcase or OGA) removes it. OGT uses uridine diphosphate N -acetylglucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc), which is synthesized by the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway, as a sugar donor. Thus, O-GlcNAc can be considered a metabolic sensor. O-GlcNAc levels can be increased by either glucosamine supplementation, which stimulates the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway, or pharmacological enzyme inhibition (e.g., inhibition of OGA) [ 61 ].\n\nThis post-translational modification is involved in many, if not all, biological processes and in the development of many diseases [ 61 ]. O-GlcNAcylation of proteins also appears to play a major role in the cellular response to stress and cell survival [ 62 , 63 ]. Increased levels of O-GlcNAcylation in cells before or immediately after exposure to stress (whether thermal, chemical, or hypoxic) have a protective effect by improving cell survival, whereas decreased levels have a deleterious effect [ 64 – 66 ]. O-GlcNAc stimulation has also been shown to be beneficial in sepsis, particularly for cardiac function during septic shock [ 67 – 69 ].\n\nSummary of preclinical works\n\nUnlike most other stressors, cellular hypoxia induced by severe hemorrhage lowers O-GlcNAc levels in cells [ 70 ]. Several animal experiments using murine models of traumatic HS have shown that increasing these levels improves cardiac function and cerebral perfusion and reduces serum lactate levels. These results were obtained by stimulating the hexosamine pathway with a substrate (glucosamine) [ 54 ] or by using OGA inhibitors, such as PUGNAc [ 70 ]. More recently, studies using another OGA inhibitor, NButGT, have shown improvement in hemodynamic and electrolyte balance via O-GlcNAcylation of renal Na/K ATPase in rats exposed to HS [ 56 , 57 ]. That stimulation of Na/K ATPase may be beneficial in the acute phase of HS is an old hypothesis [ 71 ].\n\nThe process of protein O-GlcNAcylation also plays a role in the inflammatory response. In the context of severe bleeding, increasing levels of O-GlcNAcylation lead to a reduction in acute inflammation by attenuating the increase in pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as TNFα or IL-6, as has been shown after trauma in animals in which O-GlcNAcylation was stimulated [ 52 , 54 , 70 ]. Inhibition of the NF-κB pathway by increasing levels of intracellular O-GlcNAcylation appears to be one of the mechanisms involved [ 53 ]. This effect has also been demonstrated in vascular tissue [ 72 , 73 ]. In a model of endoluminal arterial injury, rats treated with glucosamine after injury had reduced inflammation, improved healing, and a clear reduction in the formation of neointima at 14 days [ 74 ].\n\nImprovement in these biological and hemodynamic markers induced by an increase in O-GlcNAc was associated with an increase in the survival of animals. This increase in survival was observed with [ 55 ] or in the absence of resuscitation [ 52 ] in mouse models of traumatic HS. Notably, in these experiments, the treatments were initiated after the onset of shock and did not require premedication to be effective, making their use as adjuvant therapy in severe trauma plausible.\n\nStimulation of O-GlcNAc could also be beneficial after the acute phase by reducing secondary complications. It improves cellular tolerance to the ischemia–reperfusion lesions that develop after HS and that are responsible for secondary multi-visceral failure. The neuroprotective effects of O-GlcNAcylation have also been described in animal models of cerebral ischemia and hemorrhage [ 58 , 59 ]. Stimulation of O-GlcNAcylation in a mouse model of intracerebral hemorrhage reduced the size of the hematoma, reduced the inflammatory response in the brain, and reduced the functional consequences as assessed by neurological tests [ 60 ].\n\nUse in humans\n\nDietary supplementation with Glucosamine has long been used in the treatment of osteoarthritis with great tolerance [ 75 , 76 ], even in the long-term [ 77 , 78 ]. However, its clinical effect in this indication is still controversial [ 79 ], though some trials have shown an improvement in painful symptoms, and even in radiological symptoms [ 80 , 81 ]. All of these clinical trials used daily doses of glucosamine, the most common being 1500 mg/day in three doses for adults, which is lower than the amounts used experimentally to achieve a therapeutic effect in HS. Nevertheless, clinical toxicity studies conducted in humans with high doses of glucosamine (30–300 mg/kg in 6 h) have shown that glucosamine is well tolerated; it does not destabilize carbohydrate metabolism at high doses [ 82 , 83 ]. This paves the way for clinical trials with higher doses of glucosamine.\n\nAnother means of acting on O-GlcNAcylation levels are OGA inhibitors. By reducing the activity of the enzyme that removes the GlcNAc moiety from proteins, OGA inhibitors increase proteins O-GlcNAcylation levels. These molecules are used experimentally both in vitro and in vivo. The molecules most commonly used in preclinical studies have not been tested in humans. Recently, however, new molecules have been developed and tested in humans. One of the most promising compounds is MK-8719, an OGA inhibitor with very high specificity developed by Selnick et al. [ 84 ]. It is currently being studied for tauopathies [ 85 ] and has entered a phase 1 trial in humans [ 86 ]. Still in favor of the therapeutic potential of O-GlcNAcylation in tauopathies, another group has developed an OGA-inhibiting molecule (LY3372689) [ 87 ] that is currently being evaluated in a phase 2 trial in humans because its safety profile was shown to be acceptable in phase 1 clinical studies [ 88 ]. These data raise hopes for clinical trials in fields other than neurodegenerative pathologies, and especially in severe trauma and HS.\n\nHistone deacetylase inhibitors (Table 5 )\n\nBiological rationale\n\nHistones are nuclear proteins that DNA wraps around to form chromatin. Acetylation of the lysine residues on histones relaxes the chromatin, making the DNA more accessible to transcription factors. Conversely, hypoacetylation condenses chromatin and makes gene expression more difficult. This hypoacetylation of histone proteins is mediated by histone deacetylase in HS. Histone deacetylase inhibitors counteract this phenomenon and facilitate transcription dynamics, enabling the activation of mechanisms that promote cell survival [ 111 , 112 ]. There are 18 histone deacetylase isoforms in humans with different actions in different tissues [ 113 , 114 ]. Some inhibitors are class-specific, whereas others are nonspecific and act on several classes of histone deacetylase.\n\nSummary of preclinical works\n\nAmong the nonspecific histone deacetylase inhibitors, VPA is the most widely studied in the context of trauma. Like other nonspecific inhibitors, VPA first demonstrated its efficacy on the survival of murine models of HS as a pretreatment [ 115 ]. This effect was then confirmed when VPA was administered after the induction of shock to better match clinical practice. In murine models of lethal HS, administration of VPA and suberoyanilide hydroxamic acid, another nonspecific histone deacetylase inhibitor, in the absence of resuscitation increased the survival rate by > 50% compared to the control group [ 102 ]. Nonselective histone deacetylase inhibitors have also been shown to have a cell protective effect during HS [ 91 – 93 ].\n\nIn addition, VPA has been tested in large animal models with protocols combining severe trauma and HS. Treatment with VPA improved survival compared with resuscitation with isotonic saline [ 89 ], and this effect was maintained when combined with standard resuscitation with transfusion [ 104 ]. Nonselective histone deacetylase inhibitors have been shown to improve survival in HS in murine and porcine models, either alone or in combination with standard resuscitation [ 116 ].\n\nAlthough some studies have shown no efficacy of histone deacetylase inhibitors on mortality in pig models of HS [ 117 , 118 ], a meta-analysis including 101 studies exploring the effect of histone deacetylase inhibitors (specific and nonspecific) on both rodents and pigs in the context of ischemia–reperfusion, sepsis, and severe trauma clearly demonstrated an effect of histone deacetylase inhibitors on the mortality of treated animals [ 119 ]. This work also demonstrated cellular protection in the heart, brain, and kidneys, reduced inflammation, and reduced apoptosis in animals treated with histone deacetylase inhibitors. Therefore, the biological effect of histone deacetylase inhibitors in the context of severe trauma is clearly accepted, but further studies are needed before clinical trials can be planned in humans. The best specific or nonspecific inhibitors, and their most appropriate dosage, need to be defined.\n\nUse in humans\n\nVPA is the compound most likely to be tested in humans for HS in the near future because it is already authorized for and widely used in humans for the treatment of epilepsy and prevention of migraines [ 120 ]. Although the usual dosage for humans is between 20 and 30 mg/kg, doses of at least 250 mg/kg appear necessary to obtain a clinically relevant effect on HS in rat models [ 121 ]. Lower doses may be sufficient in humans given the hypermetabolism of rodents [ 122 ]. Moreover, a toxicity study carried out in healthy volunteers demonstrated good tolerance of 140 mg/kg [ 123 ]. Obviously, further studies are required in patients in shock, as the pharmacodynamics of the drug may be different in this type of patient. To the best of our knowledge, no trial is currently underway in the field of trauma, as the one listed at clinicaltrials.gov was stopped before completion due to enrollment difficulties [ 124 ]. However, a clinical trial is currently being conducted in the United Kingdom to evaluate the efficacy of VPA premedication in protecting the heart and kidneys during surgical procedures in cardiac surgery patients [ 110 ].\n\nA systemic approach: adenosine–lidocaine–magnesium solution (Table 6 )\n\nBiological rationale\n\nALM solution was empirically developed for cardiac surgery as a protective solution in cardioplegia. It consists of adenosine to inhibit the sinus node, lidocaine to reduce the amplitudes of action potentials by blocking voltage-dependent sodium channels, and magnesium to stabilize the cardiomyocyte membrane. The good results observed during surgery on the heart have led to the idea of testing this solution in the context of traumatic HS by administering it systemically. The doses required when the three molecules are used together are much lower than the usual doses of each of the three drugs, suggesting a potentiation phenomenon between them. Another enigma is that the effects of ALM solution can last several hours in animal experiments, but the half-lives of the three molecules are quite short (< 1 min for adenosine and ~ 5 h for lidocaine and magnesium) [ 142 ].\n\nSummary of preclinical works\n\nIn murine models of HS, ALM solution has resulted in a significant reduction in mortality, including when administered after the onset of shock [ 125 , 129 , 131 ]. The solution has also been tested in pig models of HS [ 133 – 135 ]. In these models, the effect on mortality was not as obvious, but multiple biological parameters were favorably modified, including hemodynamic parameters, lactate levels, and renal function. One group reported lower efficiency than conventional resuscitation using normal saline [ 137 ], but in their model, pigs were anesthetized with buprenorphine, which could have an impact on mortality [ 142 ].\n\nInitially developed for cardioplegia, ALM solution has clear cardiovascular effects during HS. It seems to reduce vascular resistance while stimulating cardiac contractility, thereby increasing the compliance of the cardiovascular system [ 133 ]. Its action on the cardiovascular system could be partly mediated by the autonomic nervous system. Authors have described an association between the overrepresentation of parasympathetic system receptors in cardiac cells (i.e., the ratio between M2 and β-1 muscarinic receptors) and the survival of rats treated with ALM solution [ 131 ]. A reduction in exsanguination has also been reported in a mouse model [ 129 ].\n\nALM solution also appears to play a role in the global blood failure that occurs during HS. A study in rats with HS showed a correction of viscoelastometric parameters and prothrombin time in animals treated with ALM solution [ 128 ]. These results have been confirmed in other studies, including in pig models [ 130 , 137 ]. Endotheliopathy also appears to be a target of ALM solution. In a mouse model, treatment was shown to limit the rise in syndecan-1, the main marker of endotheliopathy [ 141 ], and to help maintain glycocalyx thickness (intravital microscopy) in treated animals with HS. Finally, the cellular oxygen debt appears to be reduced by treatment. In a pig model, ALM solution reduced brain oxygen consumption, reduced the expression of hypoxia-inducible factors, and reduced venous lactate levels [ 135 ]. Finally, platelet function may be improved by ALM solution according to aggregometry studies carried out in rats with HS [ 130 ].\n\nAlthough its cellular mechanisms remain unclear, ALM solution has a clear biological effect and holds promise for HS by targeting both cardiac function and blood failure in the acute phase.\n\nUse in humans\n\nInitially developed for this indication, ALM solution is used by cardiac surgery centers as a protective solution in cardioplegia and has shown good results [ 143 ]. ALM solution provides better myocardial protection, and the time required to resuscitate the heart post-surgery appears to be shorter when it is used [ 144 , 145 ]. Each component of this solution is a drug already authorized for human use. The affordability and availability of these products, along with ALM solution use in cardiac surgery, suggest potential for clinical trials. However, none are currently underway. The incomplete understanding of its mechanisms in shock may be a contributing factor to this situation.\n\nDiscussion\n\nHere, we presented six molecules that we consider to be particularly promising in the field of HS. This work does not claim to be exhaustive; it does not address all candidate molecules for adjuvant treatment in HS, and this is an obvious limitation. Nevertheless, we think these molecules are good candidates for future clinical trials.\n\nThe drugs presented here are promising, but most of the experiments were carried out in murine models, and less often in porcine models. Therefore, more work is needed to confirm the results in larger animals and humans. When a biological model is changed, the initial results are not always reproduced [ 146 , 147 ]. A major limitation of many of the studies investigating adjuvant treatment for HS is indirect assessment of the efficacy of the molecule under investigation. Many works presented here fall into this category. Indeed, the parameters used, such as biomarkers of mitochondrial function, plasma levels of inflammatory markers, or ischemia–reperfusion lesions in organs, do not directly reflect the ability of these compounds to improve survival. Even if certain markers appear to be highly relevant (e.g., hemodynamic parameters), they remain secondary indicators that are not systematically associated with a gain in survival. Therefore, in this work, we selected molecules that have shown improved survival in animal models, which appears to be the only valuable primary endpoint. Most of these molecules have, so far, only shown survival gains in murine models (i.e., niacin, thiazolidinediones, PHDi, O-GlcNAc, and ALM solution), whereas histone deacetylase inhibitors have also shown survival gains in swine models. HS constitutes a systemic pathology, exerting its effects on the entirety of the body. In this regard, a holistic approach must be adopted when appraising novel therapeutic interventions.\n\nAnother limitation of preclinical results is the stereotypical nature of the trauma models studied. Researchers need perfectly calibrated and reproducible clinical situations to identify and dissect the biological mechanisms discovered. Despite the increasing complexity of models and use of larger models to approximate human biology, clinical trials do not always achieve the expected results. Clinical presentations are extremely diverse: traumas may be open or blunt, patients may be young or old, and they may have comorbidities and take medication. Treatment is not always comparable in terms of the time it takes to implement certain therapies or hospital access. Many factors, such as the ingestion of toxic substances, can also alter the body’s response to trauma [ 148 ]. Similarly, in clinical settings, the tested molecules are to be administered to patients who have received other medications, including blood products, potentially in substantial doses. Blood transfusions in patients with severe trauma modify the cytokine environment regardless of the trauma itself [ 149 ]. Consequently, the outcomes observed for the molecules described in this study may differ in clinical trials, particularly for those involving inflammation-associated signaling pathways. For this reason, in the field of HS, many molecules are often tested first in surgical patients undergoing hemorrhagic procedures, who undergo the same surgery and are, therefore, more comparable. Similarly, studies in war-wounded soldiers, who are more comparable in terms of age, comorbidities, and time to treatment, often make it easier to draw conclusions than studies in civilian populations. Thus, caution should be exercised when drawing conclusions from preclinical work in animal models.\n\nIn the area of severe trauma, there are a number of compounds that, despite a strong preclinical base, have struggled to demonstrate a benefit in clinical trials [ 142 , 150 ]. Most of the molecules presented here are already approved for human use in indications other than severe bleeding. This is the case with niacin, glitazones, glucosamine, and VPA. Thus, their toxicological profiles in humans have already been partially established. This is the concept of “drug repurposing,” which is becoming increasingly prevalent, particularly from an economic standpoint [ 151 ]. However, for the compounds we have presented here, phase 1 trials will be unavoidable. The drugs will behave differently in a severely traumatized patient. Absorption may be altered, as well as renal and/or hepatic clearance. In the case of severe bleeding, distribution factors may also be different. In addition, enzyme function may be altered in hypothermia, which is often associated with severe trauma. The other need is to determine the optimum dosage for humans suffering from trauma.\n\nIn the case of stimulating O-GlcNAcylation of proteins, inexpensive inhibitors, such as NButGT, have never been tested in humans, and those that have entered human clinical trials are still in phase 2 and for indications in chronic pathology that may have drawbacks over a long period of treatment [ 18 ]. All of this must not detract from the ethical requirements of clinical research [ 152 ], and toxicity studies will be inevitable before such molecules can be used in severe trauma patients. However, the prognosis of traumatic HS is so poor that ethics committees may consider this when deciding whether to allow a clinical trial to proceed. The risk of potential long-term side effects can be weighed against the high short-term mortality. This reasoning is quite common in major trauma and has been applied, for example, to the risks associated with the transfusion of non-Rh(D)-negative whole blood to young women of childbearing age [ 153 ]. Moreover, the short-term prognosis of severe trauma patients is poor enough to consider compassionate use of molecules that have not yet been well studied in this indication.\n\nConversely, if we were to develop molecules for prophylaxis, administered prior to the onset of shock, it would be imperative that no serious side effects be tolerated given that they would be administered to healthy individuals. Beyond premedication during surgery, preventive treatment could be given to certain professionals, such as soldiers or firefighters, before going on dangerous missions, as some authors envision for tranexamic acid [ 154 ].\n\nFigure 1 shows the pathways by which the various molecules presented in this paper may affect survival in HS based on preclinical results obtained in animal models. Some molecules appear to act through multiple pathways. We can also ask whether these molecules may work in combination, potentiating one another. This is the approach adopted by the teams working on ALM solution [ 142 ] and Chu et al. [ 15 ], who tested a solution combining niacin, dichloroacetate, and resveratrol. In these two examples, the doses needed to achieve a biological effect are much lower when the molecules are used together than the usual doses of each drug used alone. Lower doses could also mean fewer side effects when translated into humans, and combining molecules increases the chances of achieving a biological effect in a genetically heterogeneous population [ 142 ].\n\nConclusion\n\nTraumatic HS remains a major public health problem. Without questioning the concept of damage control resuscitation and earliest possible surgery, it is legitimate to seek adjuvant treatments to increase cell survival in the acute phase and improve the prognosis of these casualties. Here, we presented compounds with clear therapeutic potential that deserve to enter clinical trials soon. However, the promising results of the preclinical studies presented here should not blind us to the frequent failures of animal-to-human translation.",
