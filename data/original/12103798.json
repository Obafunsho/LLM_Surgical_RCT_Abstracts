Despite its advantages, NTI is associated with specific risks, most notably epistaxis, which occur in 18% to 88% of cases [ 4 – 8 ]. Epistaxis not only complicates surgical procedures but may also compromise airway clarity, and in severe instances, it can jeopardize patient safety and lead to ventilation challenges [ 3 ].\n\nTo mitigate the risk of epistaxis, researchers have explored various strategies, including the use of specialized tracheal tubes, topical vasoconstrictors, tube softening techniques, and optimized intubation pathways [ 9 – 13 ]. Furthermore, studies [ 14 – 17 ] have highlighted the utility of imaging modalities such as X-rays and CT scans in assessing nasal anatomy, thereby enabling the selection of a safer intubation route and reducing epistaxis incidence. However, current research on post-NTI epistaxis risk factors remains fragmented, and there is a lack of a systematic, intuitive predictive model to guide clinical decision-making.\n\nNomograms, as visual statistical prediction tools, have been widely employed in risk assessment across various medical domains due to their ability to integrate multiple predictive factors and intuitively display the probability of outcome events [ 18 ]. Building on this foundation, this study identifies risk factors through clinical data analysis, to develop a nomogram model for epistaxis risk assessment. This model offers clinicians a practical tool for preoperative quantification of epistaxis risk, enabling tailored preventive strategies, reducing epistaxis incidence, and enhancing surgical safety.\n\nMethods\n\nStudy participants\n\nThis study is a single-center, retrospective cohort study, with the study flowchart outlined in Fig. 1 . Data were retrospectively collected from 640 adult patients who underwent oral surgery under general anesthesia with nasotracheal intubation between June 2020 and December 2021. These data were systematically organized and stored in an Excel spreadsheet. All patients met the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status classification I-II criteria. To ensure data integrity and reliability, patients with incomplete records, craniofacial deformities, or coagulation disorders (e.g., prolonged prothrombin time (PT) ≥ 3 s, activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) ≥ 10 s, platelet count < 100 × 10⁹/L, or abnormal fibrinogen levels) were excluded. Additionally, patients taking anticoagulants, those with intellectual disabilities, or those with significant organ dysfunction were excluded.\n\nGiven the observational nature of the study and institutional review guidelines, patient consent was waived. Ethical approval was obtained from the hospital’s Medical Ethics Committee (approval number: SH9H-2021-T286-1), and This trial is registered with the Chinese Clinical Trial Center (No. ChiCTR2500097696), with the supplemental registration date being February 24, 2025.\n\nOutcome variables\n\nAfter nasotracheal intubation, a video laryngoscope was immediately used to visualize the pharynx and the tracheal tube cuff. Patients were categorized as epistaxis-positive if blood was visible on the cuff, evident at the posterior nasal aperture, or pooling in the oropharynx. In the absence of these findings, patients were classified as epistaxis-negative.\n\nCandidate variables\n\nThrough a comprehensive review of the literature [ 19 , 20 ] and integration of clinical expertise, a total of 17 candidate variables were selected for further analysis. Demographic and clinical characteristics included age, gender, body mass index (BMI), comorbidities (e.g., hypertension, diabetes, myocardial infarction, cerebral infarction, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), history of chronic rhinitis, history of radiotherapy or chemotherapy, history of surgical anesthesia, alcohol use history, and smoking history. Intubation-related parameters included time to intubation (defined as the duration from the nasal vestibule to the posterior nasal aperture), type of tracheal tube, initial nostril position for intubation, resistance encountered during intubation (categorized as no significant resistance or significant resistance), and imaging data related to nasal septum deviation.\n\nThe assessment of nasal septum deviation was performed by two radiologists with over a decade of experience, using coronal and cross-sectional plane of CT imaging (TOSHIBA Aquilion PRIME). The radiologists identified the layer exhibiting the most pronounced deviation, measured the maximum deviation from the midline, and recorded its location. On the coronal plane, the position relative to the superior, middle, and inferior turbinates above the maximal deviation of the nasal septum was categorized as superior, middle, or inferior part. Additionally, on the cross-sectional plane, the nasal septum at any level was divided into anterior, middle, and posterior part (Fig. 2 ). All measurements and classifications were independently confirmed by both radiologists to ensure consistency.\n\nStatistical analysis\n\nData analysis and visualization were conducted using SPSS 23.0 and R (version 4.3.3). Normality of continuous variables was assessed using the Shapiro–Wilk test. Continuous variables were considered normally distributed if the Shapiro–Wilk test yielded P > 0.05; otherwise, they were treated as non-normally distributed. Normally distributed continuous variables were expressed as mean ± standard deviation ( x̄ ± s ), and intergroup comparisons were performed using the independent samples t -test. Non-normally distributed continuous variables were presented as median (interquartile range, Q1-Q3), and intergroup comparisons were conducted using the Mann–Whitney U test. Categorical variables were expressed as percentages (%) and compared using the chi-square test or Fisher’s exact test, as appropriate. No variables required multiple imputations; missing values were imputed using the mean or mode. Additionally, the distribution of candidate variables was relatively balanced, with minimal category imbalance.\n\nThe dataset was randomly divided into a training set and a validation set at a 7:3 ratio. Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression was employed to identify variables with statistically significant differences ( P < 0.05). Variables selected by LASSO were subsequently subjected to multivariate logistic regression analysis to determine independent risk factors, calculate odds ratios (OR), and construct a multivariate logistic regression model. A nomogram visualization model was developed to predict adverse risk, and its performance was evaluated using the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, with the area under the curve (AUC) quantifying predictive accuracy. Model calibration was assessed using calibration curves to evaluate the consistency between predicted and actual probabilities. Decision curve analysis (DCA) was performed to calculate net benefits across different probability thresholds, thereby evaluating the clinical utility of the model. Statistical significance was defined as P < 0.05.\n\nResults\n\nBaseline characteristics and differential analysis\n\nA total of 640 patients who underwent nasotracheal intubation were included in this study. Of these, 66 patients were excluded due to significant missing data in baseline or anesthesia-related information, resulting in a final cohort of 574 patients for analysis. The patients were randomly divided into a training set ( n = 401) and a validation set ( n = 173) at a 7:3 ratio. The incidence of epistaxis was 18.45% in the training set and 15.61% in the validation set. Statistical comparisons between the training and validation sets revealed no significant differences in age, gender, BMI, comorbidities, history of chronic rhinitis, history of radiotherapy or chemotherapy, history of surgical anesthesia, history of alcohol abuse, smoking history, nasal intubation time, intubation technique, first-time nasal intubation status, nasal intubation resistance, maximum deviation value of the nasal septum in cross-sectional imaging, location of maximum septal deviation in cross-sectional imaging, maximum deviation value of the nasal septum in coronal imaging, or location of maximum septal deviation in coronal imaging (see Tables 1 and 2 for further details).\n\nVariable selection and model construction\n\nLASSO regression was used to select non-zero coefficient predictors from 17 variables. The optimal λ value was selected using tenfold cross-validation, aiming to include the fewest variables while maintaining model fit, and λ = 0.032 (lambda.1 se) was ultimately chosen. Five non-zero coefficient predictors were identified: age, history of radiotherapy and chemotherapy, nasopharyngeal tube insertion time, maximum deviation value of the nasal septum in the coronal plane, and maximum deviation site of the nasal septum in the cross-sectional plane. Using epistaxis occurrence as the dependent variable and the five LASSO-selected variables as independent variables, a multivariate logistic regression prediction model was constructed. Based on the LASSO-logistic regression results, a nomogram model for predicting epistaxis risk during nasotracheal intubation was developed. Details are presented in Figs. 3 and 4 and Tables 3 and 4 .\n\nEvaluation of model predictive performance\n\nDiscrimination of the model\n\nThe predictive performance of the model was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis and the corresponding area under the curve (AUC). The results demonstrated an AUC of 0.957 (95% CI: 0.932, 0.982) in the training cohort and 0.900 (95% CI: 0.824, 0.975) in the validation cohort. Both AUC values approached 1, indicating excellent discrimination and robust predictive accuracy (Fig. 5 ).\n\n(2) Calibration of the model\n\nThe consistency between predicted probabilities and observed outcomes was assessed using the Hosmer–Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test and calibration curves. Calibration curves for both the training and validation cohorts closely aligned with the ideal reference line. The Hosmer–Lemeshow test yielded non-significant P -values (training set: χ 2 = 10.966, P = 0.204; validation set: χ 2 = 10.283, P = 0.173), confirming adequate model calibration and strong concordance between predicted and actual probabilities (Fig. 6 ).\n\n(3) Clinical utility assessment\n\nThe clinical utility of the model was evaluated via decision curve analysis (DCA). The results revealed that the net benefits of the model exceeded those of conventional management strategies across a range of threshold probabilities, underscoring its potential for meaningful clinical application (Fig. 7 ).\n\nDiscussion\n\nThis study aimed to investigate the risk factors associated with epistaxis following nasal tracheal intubation and to evaluate the predictive accuracy of a nomogram model. Compared to prior studies that relied solely on logistic regression models, this work not only systematically identified multiple risk factors (e.g., age, history of chemoradiotherapy, intubation duration, nasal septal deviation values, and deviation location) but also integrated radiological data into the predictive model [ 4 ]. This approach underscores the critical role of preoperative radiological evaluation in assessing epistaxis risk. The nomogram model developed in this study demonstrated superior discriminatory ability, with training set AUC values of 0.957 and validation set AUC values of 0.900, outperforming traditional logistic models that focus exclusively on clinical factors without incorporating imaging data (AUC = 0.82) [ 4 ]. Furthermore, the nomogram provides a clear and intuitive visualization of the relative contribution of each factor to the risk of epistaxis, enabling clinicians to rapidly and accurately assess patient-specific risk levels. This facilitates the development of personalized prevention and treatment strategies.\n\nIn examining the risk factors for post-intubation epistaxis, this study not only corroborated findings from existing literature but also revealed novel insights. Specifically, age was confirmed as a significant predictor of epistaxis risk, consistent with prior studies such as those by Sim et al. [ 4 ], likely due to age-related changes in nasal mucosa and reduced vascular elasticity. However, in other risk factors, this study identified discrepancies and provided new perspectives that diverge from existing literature. Notably, the incidence of epistaxis in our study was relatively low, at 18.45% in the training set and 15.61% in the validation set, falling toward the lower end of the range reported in prior studies [ 4 – 7 , 20 ]. Our study identified a higher incidence of epistaxis in male patients compared to female patients. We explored this disparity and proposed several potential explanations. First, the larger-diameter endotracheal tubes typically required by male patients (7.0 mm ID for adult males versus 6.5 mm ID for adult females) may cause greater mechanical trauma to the nasal mucosa. Second, although multivariate analysis did not reveal a significant association, baseline data showed higher rates of smoking and alcohol consumption among male patients, which could indirectly influence nasal vascular health. Lastly, our team’s high technical proficiency and meticulous pre-procedural preparation, including selecting the more patent nostril, administering phenylephrine nasal drops pre-procedurally, and lubricating the tube with paraffin oil, likely minimized procedural errors and thus accentuated the gender-related differences in epistaxis risk [ 21 ]. Additionally, our investigation revealed no significant correlation between a history of rhinitis and the risk of epistaxis following nasotracheal intubation, which contrasts with some previous reports [ 4 ]. We offer several potential explanations for this divergence. First, patient-reported histories of rhinitis may be compromised by recall bias or inconsistent diagnostic criteria. Second, our team conducted meticulous pre-procedural assessments of nasal patency and prioritized the wider nasal passage in the inferior meatus for intubation, thereby circumventing areas of potential mucosal hypertrophy or congestion [ 1 , 7 , 22 – 24 ]. Moreover, the limited sample size may have influenced the statistical power of our results.\n\nRegarding the impact of nostril selection on epistaxis risk, our findings indicated no significant difference in epistaxis likelihood when intubation was performed via different nostrils. This is in line with the results reported by Wang et al. [ 25 , 26 ] but it conflicts with the findings of Arslan et al. [ 27 – 29 ]. We primarily attribute this discrepancy to the high level of technical proficiency in nasotracheal intubation within our team, as well as thorough pre-procedural preparation.\n\nThis study first identified an association between a history of radiotherapy and chemotherapy and epistaxis. Patients with prior radiotherapy or chemotherapy had a higher risk of epistaxis, as anticipated. Radiotherapy and chemotherapy can cause bone marrow suppression, leading to thrombocytopenia, coagulation dysfunction, increased vascular fragility, and structural changes in the head and face [ 30 ]. These factors increase the likelihood of epistaxis, especially during nasal tracheal intubation, due to nasopharyngeal tissue fragility and impaired coagulation function. However, in the multivariate analysis, the history of radiotherapy and chemotherapy was no longer statistically significant, potentially due to the very small proportion (only 1.5%) of patients with this history in our study. This limited sample size likely reduced statistical power, making it difficult to demonstrate an independent association. Additionally, there could be underlying correlations (collinearity) between radiotherapy and chemotherapy history and other stronger predictors, such as nasal septum deviation or intubation resistance, further obscuring its independent effect. Future studies with larger sample sizes should explore these specific mechanisms and evaluate targeted preventive strategies for epistaxis in patients with a history of radiotherapy and chemotherapy undergoing nasotracheal intubation.\n\nMultiple studies have consistently demonstrated the role of imaging modalities such as X-rays and computed tomography (CT) in reducing the risk of epistaxis following nasal tracheal intubation [ 14 – 17 ]. The present study further identified a strong correlation between nasal septum deviation, as assessed on both axial and coronal imaging sections, and the incidence of epistaxis. Specifically, axial imaging revealed that mid-septal deviation was associated with a protective effect, whereas coronal imaging highlighted that inferior septal deviation strongly correlated with epistaxis. These findings align with clinical observations, as the tracheal tube ideally traverses the relatively spacious inferior nasal meatus to enter the pharyngeal cavity. Inferior septal deviation is therefore more likely to cause mechanical trauma, thereby increasing the risk of hemorrhage.\n\nThese results underscore the importance of incorporating imaging studies into preoperative assessments and emphasize the need to evaluate the location and degree of septal deviation when planning nasal intubation strategies. Beyond reinforcing the value of imaging tools in epistaxis risk assessment, this study provides practical guidance for clinical practice, particularly highlighting the necessity of careful evaluation of the inferior nasal septum morphology to mitigate complications. Recent advances in artificial intelligence demonstrate significant potential for improving the detection of nasal septum deviation. Future research could integrate AI technologies to minimize measurement errors and enhance the predictive accuracy of risk stratification models, further optimizing clinical decision-making in this context [ 31 , 32 ].\n\nMeanwhile, when recording intubation resistance, we referred to the trichotomous classification method of Tong et al. [ 7 ]. However, to stabilize the model during data processing, we merged the items with significant resistance into binary classification data. The study results showed that nasal intubation duration and intubation resistance had a high correlation with epistaxis caused by nasal tracheal intubation, which was similar to the findings of Hung et al. [ 5 ], as prolonged nasal intubation duration usually indicates greater resistance during intubation. However, when constructing the nomogram prediction model, the epistaxis-negative group still had zero parameters, so it was excluded from the nomogram to ensure the reliability of the model.\n\nThis study has several limitations. First, some OR confidence intervals were wide, which may reflect estimation bias due to small subgroup sample sizes and cases with extreme anatomical characteristics. Second, the study design limited the inclusion of only a subset of potential risk factors for epistaxis. For example, specific coagulation parameters were not listed-although we rigorously reviewed each patient’s coagulation function preoperatively, and all values fell within normal clinical ranges. Future investigations could enhance stability by employing larger sample sizes, Bootstrap resampling, sensitivity analyses, and multicenter validation, while further evaluating the model’s generalizability across diverse populations and clinical settings.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe nomogram prediction model developed in this study not only effectively evaluates the risk of epistaxis following nasal tracheal intubation but also provides clinicians with a user-friendly tool to facilitate preoperative risk assessment and decision-making. By enhancing the identification of high-risk patients, this model has the potential to reduce adverse events and improve patient safety.",
