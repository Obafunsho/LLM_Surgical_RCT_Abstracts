  "abstract": "Background: Previous studies reported good outcomes of acetabular cup placement using portable navigation systems during THA. However, we are aware of no prospective studies comparing inexpensive portable navigation systems using augmented reality (AR) technology with accelerometer-based portable navigation systems in THA.\n\nQuestions/purposes: (1) Is the placement accuracy of the acetabular cup using the AR-based portable navigation system superior to that of an accelerometer-based portable navigation system? (2) Do the frequencies of surgical complications differ between the two groups?\n\nMethods: We conducted a prospective, two-arm, parallel-group, randomized controlled trial involving patients scheduled for unilateral THA. Between August and December 2021, we treated 148 patients who had a diagnosis of osteoarthritis, idiopathic osteonecrosis, rheumatoid arthritis, or femoral neck fracture and were scheduled to undergo unilateral primary THA. Of these patients, 100% (148) were eligible, 90% (133) were approached for inclusion in the study, and 85% (126) were finally randomized into either the AR group (62 patients) or the accelerometer group (64 patients). An intention-to-treat analysis was performed, and there was no crossover between groups and no dropouts; all patients in both groups were included in the analysis. There were no differences in any key covariates, including age, sex, and BMI, between the two groups. All THAs were performed via the modified Watson-Jones approach with the patient in the lateral decubitus position. The primary outcome was the absolute difference between the cup placement angle displayed on the screen of the navigation system and that measured on postoperative radiographs. The secondary outcome was intraoperative or postoperative complications recorded during the study period for the two portable navigation systems.\n\nResults: There were no differences between the AR and accelerometer groups in terms of the mean absolute difference in radiographic inclination angle (3° ± 2° versus 3° ± 2° [95% CI -1.2° to 0.3°]; p = 0.22). The mean absolute difference in radiographic anteversion angle displayed on the navigation screen during surgery compared with that measured on postoperative radiographs was smaller in the AR group than that in the accelerometer group (2° ± 2° versus 5° ± 4° [95% CI -4.2° to -2.0°]; p < 0.001). There were few complications in either group. In the AR group, there was one patient each with a surgical site infection, intraoperative fracture, distal deep vein thrombosis, and intraoperative pin loosening; in the accelerometer group, there was one patient each with an intraoperative fracture and intraoperative loosening of pins.\n\nConclusion: Although the AR-based portable navigation system demonstrated slight improvements in radiographic anteversion of cup placement compared with the accelerometer-based portable navigation system in THA, whether those small differences will prove clinically important is unknown. Until or unless future studies demonstrate clinical advantages that patients can perceive that are associated with such small radiographic differences, because of the costs and the unquantified risks associated with novel devices, we recommend against the widespread use of these systems in clinical practice.\n\nLevel of Evidence: Level I, therapeutic study.",

Several computer-aided navigation systems have been developed to improve the accuracy of acetabular cup placement and reduce the rates of complications, including dislocation and revision surgery [ 1 , 3 , 15 ]. However, because these computer navigation systems have disadvantages, including radiation exposure, high cost, difficulty of use, and the requirement for large computer consoles, there is a need for a navigation system that is inexpensive and accurate. To address these problems, a number of portable navigation systems have been developed [ 9 , 10 , 12 ].\n\nA randomized controlled trial (RCT) reported that an accelerometer-based portable navigation system achieved more-accurate acetabular cup placement than the conventional method using a mechanical guide in patients undergoing THA in the lateral decubitus position [ 12 ]. Recently, augmented reality (AR)–based, portable navigation systems that register the functional pelvic plane using a smartphone with the patient in the supine position on an intraoperative bed have been developed to improve the accuracy of cup placement [ 9 , 10 ]. One RCT suggested that the AR-based portable navigation system could achieve improved accuracy of acetabular cup placement compared with the conventional method in the lateral decubitus position as determined by measurements on radiographs and CT images obtained 3 months after surgery [ 10 ]. One retrospective, comparative study reported that an AR-based portable navigation system showed more accurate acetabular cup placement than an accelerometer-based portable navigation system in the lateral decubitus position [ 13 ]. To our knowledge, however, there have been no prospective studies comparing the outcomes of surgeries performed using two different portable navigation systems. Because the accelerometer-based portable navigation system is the most commonly used portable navigation system, it was used as the control in the standard treatment arm in the present study.\n\nWe therefore performed an RCT in which we asked: (1) Is the placement accuracy of the acetabular cup using the AR-based portable navigation system superior to that of an accelerometer-based portable navigation system? (2) Do the frequencies of surgical complications differ between the two groups?\n\nPatients and Methods\n\nStudy Design and Setting\n\nThis prospective, two-arm, parallel-group, single-blind RCT was performed at one hospital (Hokusuikai Kinen Hospital, Mito, Japan), which is a joint reconstruction center in a rural area in Japan.\n\nParticipants\n\nPatients with a diagnosis of osteoarthritis, idiopathic osteonecrosis, rheumatoid arthritis, or femoral neck fracture who were scheduled to undergo unilateral primary THA were recruited for the study between August 2021 and December 2021. Patients scheduled for simultaneous bilateral THA, staged bilateral THA, revision THA, THA combined with subtrochanteric osteotomy, THA using CT-based navigation systems because of pelvic asymmetry, and THA with the patient in the supine position were excluded.\n\nAll patients provided informed consent after receiving an explanation of the purpose of the trial to investigate the accuracy of acetabular cup placement during THA and the random assignment to undergo treatment using the accelerometer-based portable navigation system or AR-based portable navigation system.\n\nAccelerometer-based and AR-based Portable Navigation Systems\n\nWe compared the accuracy of acetabular cup placement using two portable navigation systems. In this study we did not use navigation on the femoral side for either system. The AR-based portable navigation system (AR-Hip, Zimmer Biomet Japan) was compared with the most commonly used accelerometer-based portable navigation system (HipAlign, OrthAlign) as a control. Neither preoperative nor intraoperative imaging was required in either navigation system. The surgeon performed registration intraoperatively and created a pelvic 3D coordinate system to define the position of the pelvis. During acetabular cup placement, the inclination and anteversion angles were displayed in real time in both systems.\n\nThe accelerometer-based portable navigation system consisted of a disposable computer navigation unit and a reference sensor. The 3D coordinate system was created with the patient in the lateral decubitus position (Fig. 1 A). The navigation unit and reference sensor were paired and calibrated on a flat table before surgery, and were determined by two planes: the plane vertical to the upper surface of the surgical table and the longitudinal coronal plane of the body. The inclination and anteversion angles of the acetabular cup were confirmed with reference to the radiographic definition on the display [ 12 ] (Fig. 1 B). This accelerometer-based portable navigation system costs approximately USD 1000 per procedure in Japan.\n\nThe AR-based portable navigation system allows the surgeon to view computer-generated images of the acetabular cup in the real world and in real time using AR technology through a smartphone display. The 3D coordinate system was created with the patient in the supine position (Fig. 2 A). The reference plane of the AR-based portable navigation system is the functional pelvic plane, determined by the line of a gravitational vector obtained from the gyro sensor built into the smartphone and the line of direction vectors connecting the bilateral anterior superior iliac spines used in registration as anatomic bony landmarks [ 8 , 10 ]. While maintaining the sterility of pins inserted into the iliac crest, the surgeon placed the patient in the lateral decubitus position after registration. Using the AR-based portable navigation system, the acetabular cup placement angle could be viewed on the surgical field during THA on the smartphone display in the radiographic definition and functional pelvic plane (Fig. 2 B). This AR-based portable navigation system costs roughly USD 500 per procedure in Japan.\n\nRandomization and Blinding\n\nFor random allocation of the patients to either the AR group or accelerometer group, random numbers (from 0 to 99) were generated using R software (The R Foundation for Statistical Computing) and sealed in separate opaque envelopes. An orthopaedic surgeon (KK or HO) selected one envelope at random 1 week before the surgery. The patient was assigned to the accelerometer group if an odd number was selected or to the AR group if an even number was selected. The patient and outcome assessors were blinded to group allocation. However, blinding was not possible for the surgeons, operating room nurses, and anesthesiologists because of the nature of the procedures.\n\nPatient Characteristics\n\nOf 148 patients assessed for eligibility, 22 were excluded, and the remaining 126 patients were included in the trial. These patients were randomly assigned to the AR or accelerometer group (n = 62 and n = 64, respectively) as described above (Fig. 3 ). There were no important differences in patient characteristics between the two groups (Table 1 ).\n\nSurgery and Rehabilitation\n\nTHA was performed or supervised by one of three surgeons (KK, HO, or NH) using the modified Watson-Jones approach with the patient in the lateral decubitus position under general anesthesia using neither a peripheral nerve block nor epidural anesthesia [ 2 ]. We palpated the bilateral anterior superior iliac spine and ischium and set the lateral decubitus position as accurately as possible. The three surgeons had used both navigation systems at least 50 times before the study period; the accelerometer’s portable navigation system had been used 55 times by KK, 52 times by HO, and 62 times by NH, and the AR-based portable navigation system had been used 60, 55, and 68 times by each surgeon, respectively. In all operations, cementless acetabular cups (G7, Zimmer Biomet) were routinely placed using 16-mm and 20-mm screws.\n\nA radiographic inclination target angle of 40° was used in all operations. The radiographic anteversion angle was set between 15° and 25° intraoperatively to prevent the acetabular cup from hanging over the anterior edge of the acetabulum and avoid the occurrence of iliopsoas impingement [ 14 ].\n\nWe used 119 cementless and seven cemented femoral stems for the femoral component.\n\nIn all patients, ROM and gait training were commenced without restriction on the day after surgery.\n\nOutcome Measurements\n\nThe prespecified primary outcome was the absolute difference between the cup placement angles displayed on the screen of the navigation system immediately after cup placement and those measured on postoperative radiographs taken on the day of surgery with the patient in the supine position. Radiographs were taken immediately after surgery to evaluate the cup placement angle, because this is the standard imaging method and has the lowest exposure dose. Two orthopaedic surgeons (MS and ST) who did not participate in the surgery and who were completely blinded to the patient characteristics and group allocation independently measured the radiographic inclination and radiographic anteversion angles once for each patient and calculated the mean values. Radiographs were taken by visually aligning the height of the bilateral anterior superior iliac spine. If the sacral midline and pubic tubercle were misaligned, the radiographs were taken again. Radiographic cup orientation was measured according to Widmer [ 16 ] on plain radiographs using Two-Dimensional Template computer software (Kyocera Medical) on another day (Fig. 4 ). To evaluate interobserver reliability, the intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) for postoperative measurements of cup inclination and anteversion angles on radiographs determined by the two assessors were calculated [ 6 ]. Between the two assessors, the ICCs for measurement of the angles of acetabular cup placement were 0.91 (95% CI 0.88 to 0.94) for radiographic inclination and 0.87 (95% CI 0.82 to 0.91) for radiographic anteversion.\n\nThe secondary outcomes were any intraoperative or postoperative complications recorded during the study period and operative times for the two portable navigation systems.\n\nThe trial was prospectively registered, and no changes were made to trial outcomes after the trial began.\n\nSample Size Calculation\n\nThis RCT was designed as a superiority trial. The primary hypothesis was that the accuracy of the cup placement angle would be better in the AR group. There is no consensus about the clinically meaningful difference in cup placement angle when comparing accuracy among different computer navigation systems in THA. Before starting this RCT, we organized a study group focusing on the clinically meaningful difference and determined that a 2° difference would be clinically meaningful when comparing the AR and accelerometer groups. The decision of 2° as a clinically meaningful difference in this RCT referred to a previous RCT that used this difference for sample size calculation [ 10 ]. A standard deviation of 3.8° was used for the sample size calculation based on preliminary data. A sample size of 57 was calculated for each arm of the trial (α = 0.05; β = 0.80). Assuming a dropout rate of 5%, we set the minimum sample size as 60 patients per arm.\n\nEthical Approval\n\nThe study protocol and publication were approved by the ethics committee of Hokusuikai Kinen Hospital, and the study was performed in accordance with the ethical standards of the 1964 Declaration of Helsinki. All patients provided written informed consent before enrollment in the study.\n\nStatistical Analysis\n\nWe investigated differences in the primary outcome between the AR and accelerometer groups on an intention-to-treat basis. The absolute values of the differences between the angles displayed on the navigation screen and those measured on radiographs were examined for statistical significance using a t-test.\n\nWe analyzed differences in categorical variables between the two groups using the chi-square test and t-test, and we analyzed continuous variables using a t-test. Statistical analyses were performed with EZR (Saitama Medical Center, Jichi Medical University) [ 5 ]. All tests were two-sided, and p < 0.05 was taken to indicate statistical significance.\n\nResults\n\nAlignment\n\nThe mean absolute difference in radiographic inclination angle displayed on the navigation screen during surgery compared with that measured on postoperative radiographs was not different between the AR and accelerometer groups (3° ± 2° versus 3° ± 2° [95% CI -1.2° to 0.3°]; p = 0.22) (Fig. 5 ). The mean absolute difference in the radiographic anteversion angle displayed on the navigation screen during surgery compared with that measured on postoperative radiographs was smaller in the AR group than in the accelerometer group (2° ± 2° versus 5° ± 4° [95% CI -4.2° to -2.0°]; p < 0.001) (Fig. 6 ).\n\nComplications and Operative Time\n\nThere were few complications in either group (Table 2 ). There was no difference in operative time between the AR and accelerometer groups (45 ± 9 minutes versus 48 ± 10 minutes [95% CI -6.2 to 0.6]; p = 0.1).\n\nDiscussion\n\nPortable navigation systems have been used in THA to improve the accuracy of cup placement. Recently, inexpensive AR-based portable navigation systems have been introduced, but no randomized trials we are aware of have evaluated them. This study was performed to determine whether the AR-based portable navigation system has any advantages over the accelerometer-based portable navigation system. The results showed that the AR-based portable navigation system slightly improved the accuracy of radiographic anteversion placement compared with the accelerometer-based portable navigation system during THA with the patient in the lateral decubitus position. However, until or unless future studies demonstrate clinical advantages that patients can perceive that are associated with such small radiographic differences, because of the additional costs of these devices, we recommend against the widespread use of these systems in clinical practice.\n\nLimitations\n\nFirst, the external validity (generalizability to other practices) of the present study is unknown because the results were obtained from a single center and all procedures were conducted by surgeons at a high-volume joint reconstruction center. The AR-based system cannot be recommended until its external validity is clarified. Second, the AR-based portable navigation system showed approximately 3° better accuracy regarding radiographic anteversion placement than the accelerometer-based portable navigation system, but whether this will improve clinical results in ways that patients can perceive (such as by reducing the risk of dislocation) is unknown and speculative. Therefore, the use of AR-based portable navigation systems, which require additional costs, cannot be recommended until or unless an advantage with regard to clinical outcomes is demonstrated. Third, radiographs taken immediately after surgery with the patient under anesthesia may not have been accurate for assessment in the present study because the measurements might have been affected by pelvic tilt. Finally, we measured the angle of implant placement on radiographs, which is the most common method with the lowest level of radiation exposure. However, this method may be inaccurate. Further investigations using crosstable lateral radiographs or CT images obtained at least 6 weeks after surgery are needed to confirm or refute our findings.\n\nAlignment\n\nThe small differences favoring the AR-based portable navigation system in the present study may make it preferable over the accelerometer-based portable navigation system, assuming the cost differences are consistent across other centers. However, unless these devices demonstrate benefits that patients can perceive, such as a reduced risk of dislocation, better hip performance, or greater implant durability, they should not be used in clinical practice.\n\nOne previous RCT suggested that an AR-based portable navigation system can achieve slightly more accurate cup placement than the conventional technique, in which a mechanical guide is used in patients in the lateral decubitus position through a modified Watson-Jones approach [ 10 ]. Those authors reported that the AR-based portable navigation system provided a slightly more accurate cup placement angle of approximately 2° in radiographic inclination than a goniometer did, but there were no corresponding advantages to clinical results [ 10 ].\n\nOne previous RCT compared the accuracy of acetabular cup placement using an accelerometer-based portable navigation system with the conventional method using a mechanical guide in patients undergoing THA in the lateral decubitus position via the posterolateral approach [ 12 ]. In that study, the accelerometer-based portable navigation system was slightly more accurate for cup placement than the conventional mechanical guidance method by approximately 3° in both radiographic inclination and anteversion, but again, those differences did not affect clinical outcomes [ 12 ].\n\nAnother study retrospectively compared accelerometer-based and AR-based portable navigation systems with patients in the lateral decubitus position through a modified Watson-Jones approach [ 13 ]. In that study, the AR-based portable navigation system had slightly better cup placement accuracy than the accelerometer-based portable navigation system did, with radiographic inclination of approximately 2° and radiographic anteversion of approximately 4°, but that study also showed no difference in clinical results, and the observed benefits may have been overestimated because of the retrospective nature of that study. The slightly greater cup placement accuracy of the AR-based portable navigation system compared with the accelerometer-based portable navigation system might have been caused by differences in registration [ 13 ]. The anterior superior iliac spines were used to register the pelvis and create a reference plane for the functional pelvic plane in the supine position in the AR group. After registration, the functional pelvic plane can be followed even in a patient in the lateral decubitus position. By contrast, in the accelerometer group, registration was performed along the body axis in the lateral decubitus position to determine the reference plane. Therefore, the reference plane depended on pelvic tilt during registration in the accelerometer group. These differences may have resulted in greater accuracy of cup placement in the AR group than in the accelerometer group in this study. This could also explain the observed difference in cup placement accuracy.\n\nComplications\n\nWe found no differences in the number or kinds of observed complications between our study groups, but the study was underpowered to make formal statistical comparisons. Worth noting, however, were the observed problems with pins in both groups; this kind of complication does not occur in non-navigated THA, and because more serious problems related to pin use in navigated lower extremity arthroplasty (such as subsequent fractures, nerve injuries, or infections) have been reported [ 4 , 11 ], we point out that all new technologies might have unintended (and sometimes severe) adverse consequences [ 7 ]. It is for this reason that the AR-based system cannot be recommended until the external validity is clarified, despite the slight improvement in anteversion accuracy.\n\nConclusion\n\nAlthough the AR-based portable navigation system slightly improved radiographic anteversion of cup placement compared with the accelerometer-based portable navigation system in THA, until or unless future studies identify clinical benefits patients can perceive that are associated with these small radiographic differences, we would recommend against its widespread use because of its added costs.",
