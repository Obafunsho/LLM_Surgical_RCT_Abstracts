  "title": "Duration of Acute Kidney Injury Impacts Long-term Survival Following Cardiac Surgery",
  "abstract": "Background: Acute kidney injury (AKI) following cardiac surgery is associated with worse outcomes. However, it is not known how adverse long-term consequences vary according to the duration of AKI. We sought to determine the association between duration of AKI and survival.\n\nMethods: 4,987 cardiac surgery patients from 2002 through 2007 with serum creatinine (SCr) collection at a medical center in northern New England. AKI was defined as a ≥0.3 (mg/dL) or ≥50% increase in SCr from baseline and further classified into AKI network stages. Duration of AKI was defined by the number of days AKI was present and categorized by: no AKI, AKI for 1–2, 3–6 and ≥7 days.\n\nResults: 39% of patients developed AKI. Long-term survival was significantly different by AKI duration (p < 0.001). The proportion of patients with AKI duration, adjusted hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals for mortality (no AKI as referent), were: 1–2 days (18%, HR 1.66; 1.32–2.09), 3–6 days (11%, HR 1.94; 1.51–2.49), ≥7 days (9%, HR 3.40; 2.73–4.25). This graded relationship of duration of AKI with long-term mortality persisted when patients who died during hospitalization were excluded from analysis (p < 0.001). Propensity matched analysis confirmed results.\n\nConclusion: The duration of AKI after cardiac surgery is directly proportional to long-term mortality. This AKI dose-dependent effect on long-term mortality helps to close the gap between association and causation, whereby AKI stages and AKI duration have important implications for patient care and can aid clinicians in evaluating the risk of in-hospital and post discharge death.",
