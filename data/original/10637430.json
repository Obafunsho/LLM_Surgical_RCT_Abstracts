  "title": "Improving Neurotrauma by Depolarization Inhibition With Combination Therapy: A Phase 2 Randomized Feasibility Trial",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:: Spreading depolarizations (SDs) are a pathological mechanism that mediates lesion development in cerebral gray matter. They occur in ∼60% of patients with severe traumatic brain injury (TBI), often in recurring and progressive patterns from days 0 to 10 after injury, and are associated with worse outcomes. However, there are no protocols or trials suggesting how SD monitoring might be incorporated into clinical management. The objective of this protocol is to determine the feasibility and efficacy of implementing a treatment protocol for intensive care of patients with severe TBI that is guided by electrocorticographic monitoring of SDs.\n\nMETHODS:: Patients who undergo surgery for severe TBI with placement of a subdural electrode strip will be eligible for enrollment. Those who exhibit SDs on electrocorticography during intensive care will be randomized 1:1 to either (1) standard care that is blinded to the further course of SDs or (2) a tiered intervention protocol based on efficacy to suppress further SDs. Interventions aim to block the triggering and propagation of SDs and include adjusted targets for management of blood pressure, CO 2 , temperature, and glucose, as well as ketamine pharmacotherapy up to 4 mg/kg/ hour. Interventions will be escalated and de-escalated depending on the course of SD pathology.\n\nEXPECTED OUTCOMES:: We expect to demonstrate that electrocorticographic monitoring of SDs can be used as a real- time diagnostic in intensive care that leads to meaningful changes in patient management and a reduction in secondary injury, as compared with standard care, without increasing medical complications or adverse events.\n\nDISCUSSION:: This trial holds potential for personalization of intensive care management by tailoring therapies based on monitoring and confirmation of the targeted neuronal mechanism of SD. Results are expected to validate the concept of this approach, inform refinement of the treatment protocol, and lead to larger-scale trials.",
