  "title": "The role of sealants for achieving anastomotic hemostasis in vascular\nsurgery",
  "abstract": "Background: During vascular interventions, connections that link arteries, veins, or\nsynthetic grafts, which are known as an ‘anastomosis', may be necessary.\nVascular anastomoses can bleed from the needle holes that result from\nthe creation of the anastomoses. Various surgical options are available\nfor achieving hemostasis, or the stopping of bleeding, including the\napplication of sealants directly onto the bleeding vessels or tissues.\nSealants are designed for use in vascular surgery as adjuncts when\nconventional interventions are ineffective and are applied directly by\nthe surgeon to seal bleeding anastomoses. Despite the availability of\nseveral different types of sealants, the evidence for the clinical\nefficacy of these hemostatic adjuncts has not been definitively\nestablished in vascular surgery patients.\n\nObjectives: To evaluate the benefits and harms of sealants as adjuncts for achieving\nanastomotic site hemostasis in patients undergoing vascular surgery.\n\nSearch methods: The Cochrane Vascular Information Specialist conducted systematic\nsearches of the following databases: the Cochrane Vascular Specialised\nRegister via the Cochrane Register of Studies; the Cochrane Central\nRegister of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); MEDLINE via Ovid; Embase via\nOvid ; and CINAHL via EBSCO. We also searched ClinicalTrials.gov and the\nWHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform for clinical trials.\nReference lists of included trials and relevant reviews were also\nsearched. The latest search date was 6 March 2023.\n\nSelection criteria: We included randomized controlled trials that compared fibrin or\nsynthetic sealant use with alternative interventions (e.g. manual\ncompression, reversal of anticoagulation) for achieving anastomotic‐site\nhemostasis in vascular surgery procedures. We included participants who\nunderwent the creation of an anastomosis during vascular surgery. We\nexcluded non‐vascular surgery patients.\n\nData collection and analysis: We have used standard Cochrane methods. Our primary outcomes were time to\nhemostasis, failure of hemostatic intervention, and intraoperative blood\nloss. Our secondary outcomes were operating time, death from bleeding\ncomplications up to 30 days, postoperative bleeding up to 30 days,\nunplanned return to the operating room for bleeding complications\nmanagement up to 30 days, quality of life, and adverse events. We used\nGRADE to assess the certainty of evidence for each outcome.\n\nMain results: We found 24 randomized controlled trials that included a total of 2376\nparticipants who met the inclusion criteria. All trials compared sealant\nuse with standard care controls, including oxidized cellulose, gelatin\nsponge, and manual compression. All trials were at high risk of\nperformance bias, detection bias, and other sources of bias. We\ndowngraded the certainty of evidence for risk of bias concerns,\ninconsistency, imprecision and possible publication bias. Combining data on time to hemostasis showed that sealant use may reduce\nthe mean time to hemostasis compared to control (mean difference (MD)\n‐230.09 seconds, 95% confidence interval (CI) ‐329.24 to ‐130.94; P <\n0.00001; 7 studies, 498 participants; low‐certainty evidence). Combining\ndata on failure of hemostatic intervention showed that sealant use may\nreduce the rate of failure compared to control, but the evidence is very\nuncertain (risk ratio (RR) 0.46, 95% CI 0.35 to 0.61; P < 0.00001; 17\nstudies, 2120 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). We did not\ndetect any clear differences between the sealant and control groups for\nintraoperative blood loss (MD ‐32.69 mL, 95% CI ‐96.21 to 30.83; P =\n0.31; 3 studies, 266 participants; low‐certainty evidence); operating\ntime (MD ‐18.72 minutes, 95% CI ‐40.18 to 2.73; P = 0.09; 4 studies, 436\nparticipants; low‐certainty evidence); postoperative bleeding (RR 0.78,\n95% CI 0.59 to 1.04; P = 0.09; 9 studies, 1216 participants;\nlow‐certainty evidence), or unplanned return to the operating room (RR\n0.27, 95% CI 0.04 to 1.69; P = 0.16; 8 studies, 721 participants;\nlow‐certainty evidence). No studies reported death from bleeding or\nquality of life outcomes.\n\nAuthors' conclusions: Based on meta‐analysis of 24 trials with 2376 participants, our review\ndemonstrated that sealant use for achieving anastomotic hemostasis in\nvascular surgery patients may result in reduced time to hemostasis, and\nmay reduce rates of hemostatic intervention failure, although the\nevidence is very uncertain, when compared to standard controls. Our\nanalysis showed there may be no differences in intraoperative blood\nloss, operating time, postoperative bleeding up to 30 days, and\nunplanned return to the operating room for bleeding complications up to\n30 days. Deaths and quality of life could not be analyzed. Limitations\ninclude the risk of bias in all studies. Our review has demonstrated that using sealants may reduce the time\nrequired to achieve hemostasis and the rate of hemostatic failure.\nHowever, a significant risk of bias was identified in the included\nstudies, and future trials are needed to provide unbiased data and\naddress other considerations such as cost‐effectiveness and adverse\nevents with sealant use.",
