  "full_text": "INTRODUCTION\n\nWorldwide, there are approximately 823 individuals per million population with end-stage kidney disease, 1 and the number continues to increase over time. Kidney transplantation (KT) is an alternative to dialysis that not only improves the quality of life but also prolongs life expectancy in patients with end-stage kidney disease. 2 , 3 The number of KTs has increased over time, with 27 332 KTs performed in the United States in 2023. 4 Immunosuppressive medication is necessary after KT to prevent rejection and maintain allograft function. However, immunosuppression increases the risk of opportunistic infection. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is one of the most common opportunistic infections after solid organ transplantation and can affect KT recipients directly and indirectly. 5 CMV infection can cause direct organ damage, leading to acute rejection and the development of new infections as an indirect effect of the virus. 5 Prevention of CMV infection is thus crucial for successful organ transplantation.\n\nSeveral preventive methods have been used to avoid adverse events associated with CMV infection. 6 Prolonged universal prophylaxis with (val)ganciclovir has decreased the incidence of CMV infection in donor–recipient mismatch comprising CMV donor-seropositive (D + )/recipient-seronegative (R − ) KT recipients, which is associated with a high risk of developing CMV infection. 7 However, adverse effects associated with (val)ganciclovir, especially leukocytopenia, are common. 8 Thus, a newer anti-CMV agent, letermovir, was studied in this population. 9 Letermovir showed a better adverse effect profile and noninferiority for efficacy. 9 However, approximately 10% of high-risk KT recipients still develop CMV disease after stopping prophylactic medication (ie, late-onset CMV). 9 Additionally, these anti-CMV agents cause resistant strains, sometimes resulting in resistant or refractory CMV infections. 10 Therefore, novel prophylactic medications that produce better efficacy and fewer adverse effects while reducing the emergence of resistant strains are warranted. This research should be performed in KT recipients, who represent the most common solid organ transplant recipients, and should specifically target CMV D + /R − recipients.\n\nMonoclonal antibody therapy has shown significant benefits in treating and preventing viral diseases, especially SARS-CoV-2. 11 , 12 This trend was also seen for other viruses, such as respiratory syncytial virus. 13 , 14 However, monoclonal antibody therapy for preventing CMV after solid organ transplantation has not been well studied. Fiztasovimab (NPC-21), a fully human-neutralizing monoclonal antibody targeting the epitope of CMV glycoprotein B, showed a significant anti-CMV effect in an in vitro study. 15\n\nWe hypothesized that NPC-21 would prevent CMV disease and/or infection in high-risk KT recipients. Therefore, we performed a multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled, phase 2 trial comparing NPC-21 versus placebo in KT recipients with CMV D + /R − serostatus. The primary objective was to assess the efficacy and safety of NPC-21 when administered prophylactically to CMV seronegative recipient who received a first KT from a CMV seropositive donor.\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\n\nPatient Selection and Study Design\n\nThis was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 2 study of NPC-21 for KT recipients at high risk of CMV infection in the United States and Japan. We enrolled adult KT recipients aged between 18 and 75 y, with living or deceased donors and CMV D + /R − serostatus. Owing to potential safety concerns, we did not include pediatric or older populations. We excluded patients who received CMV hyperimmune globulin or intravenous immunoglobulin within 28 d before randomization or for whom plasmapheresis was planned after randomization. We also excluded patients who underwent multiorgan transplantation, had previously undergone solid organ or hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, and patients with a body weight >120 kg at the time of screening, anticipating drug shortages if we enrolled overweight patients. Regarding the dose, we hypothesized that NPC-21 effectively prevented CMV infection when the medication trough concentration was >19 µg/mL. NPC-21 has been shown to inhibit cell-to-cell transmission of all clinical CMV isolates tested with a 90% inhibitory concentration range of 13–19 µg/mL. 15 From simulations using the pharmacokinetic data from the phase 1 study, 16 it was assumed that 6 mg/kg NPC-21 once every 4 wk would maintain the lower limit (19 µg/mL) of the 95% confidence interval of the trough on day 29. A small cohort of patients who received 12 mg/kg NPC-21 was added for an exposure/response analysis.\n\nAfter written informed consent was obtained from all potential patients, the KT recipients were randomized to receive either 6 mg/kg NPC-21, 12 mg/kg NPC-21, or placebo in a 4:1:4 ratio. Randomization was stratified by region (United States or Japan) via the Interactive Response Technology system. Randomization information was concealed from the investigators and the patients until the end of the study. After enrollment, the patients received the assigned study medication on day 1 and weeks 4, 8, and 12. Premedication to prevent adverse events was not prescribed for NPC-21 administration. If CMV infection was diagnosed, the patients received rescue therapy by the local standard of care, and administration of NPC-21 or placebo was discontinued. None of the recipients received anti-CMV medication as prophylaxis.\n\nEndpoints and Follow-up\n\nThe primary efficacy endpoint was CMV infection, defined as either CMV disease (CMV syndrome or tissue-invasive CMV disease) or asymptomatic CMV DNAemia. CMV disease was judged by the investigators in accordance with the definition of Ljungman et al. 17 Asymptomatic CMV DNAemia was defined as the detection of 250 IU/mL CMV DNA in plasma measured by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis in a central laboratory, meeting the cutoff value that was set in accordance with a previous report, 18 or meeting the local criteria for asymptomatic CMV DNAemia measured by PCR analysis or antigenemia testing in each institute, by week 16. CMV infections were evaluated for the 6 mg/kg NPC-21 group, 12 mg/kg NPC-21 group, combined NPC-21 groups, and placebo group. CMV testing was performed weekly until week 24 and biweekly until week 28, per the study protocol. A central laboratory performed CMV PCR analysis (Abbott m2000; Abbott Molecular Inc, Des Plaines, IL; central laboratory: Medpace Reference Laboratory, Cincinnati, OH). For patient safety reasons, we did not restrict CMV testing in each institute.\n\nThe secondary efficacy endpoints comprised the incidence of CMV infection by week 28, incidence of CMV disease, time to CMV infection, CMV viral load, and duration of the CMV-specific treatment. NPC-21 is an antibody drug; thus, we carefully monitored the patients for signs of infusion reactions. All adverse events were categorized in accordance with the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities terminology.\n\nStatistical Analysis and Sample Size Calculation\n\nA sample size calculation was performed for KT recipients who received at least 1 dose of study medication. Based on previously published data, 18 , 19 CMV infection, the primary efficacy endpoint, was estimated at 60% in the placebo arm. The incidence of CMV infection in the 6 mg/kg NPC-21 group was estimated at 30%. With a 1:1 ratio, each group required 48 recipients to achieve a 2-sided significance level of 0.05 and 80% power. The 12 mg/kg NPC-21 group also required 12 recipients for the exposure/response analysis. Thus, 108 patients were planned for enrollment in the current study.\n\nThe modified intention-to-treat (mITT) population included all patients who received a KT from a living or deceased donor and received at least 1 dose of the study drug (6 mg/kg NPC-21, 12 mg/kg NPC-21, or placebo). Data from the mITT population were used for all efficacy analyses. Demographics were analyzed using descriptive statistics. Two-sided 95% exact Clopper-Pearson confidence intervals were provided for the confidence intervals of the proportions. The proportional difference and 95% unstratified Miettinen-Nurminen (score) confidence limits were presented for any 2 treatment groups. The primary efficacy endpoint was summarized by treatment group and compared across the placebo and 6 mg/kg NPC-21 treatment groups using a logistic regression analysis with a stratification factor for the region (United States or Japan) as a covariate. Statistical significance was defined as a P value of <0.05, and statistical analysis was performed using SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC).\n\nThis study was performed in accordance with the guidelines of the Declaration of Helsinki after receiving approval from the institutional review boards.\n\nRESULTS\n\nBetween July 2020 and August 2022, 102 potential pre-KT recipients (Figure 1 ) were screened in 14 and 17 centers in the United States and Japan, respectively. Fifteen recipients were excluded, and 87 KT recipients were randomized (6 mg/kg NPC-21: 38; 12 mg/kg NPC-21: 11; and placebo: 38). All patients who were randomized received at least 1 dose of study medication (NPC-21 or placebo; Figure 1 ). Ten patients discontinued the study before week 16, with no evidence of CMV disease or asymptomatic CMV DNAemia (6 mg/kg NPC-21: 5; 12 mg/kg NPC-21: 1; placebo: 4). Due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the medication expiration date, we could not achieve sample size. The baseline characteristics of the 87 enrolled patients are shown in Table 1 . The characteristics were well balanced across the groups.\n\nCMV Infection\n\nTable 2 summarizes the details of the CMV infections. CMV infection was observed in 29 of 38 (76.3%), 9 of 11 (81.8%), and 26 of 38 (68.4%) patients in the 6 mg/kg NPC-21, 12 mg/kg NPC-21, and placebo groups, respectively. There was no statistically significant difference between the groups. The results of the time-to-event analysis showed a similar trend (Figure 2 A).\n\nCMV disease by week 16 was observed in 2 of 49 patients (4.1%) in the combined NPC-21 groups, consisting of 2 of 38 patients (5.3%) and 0 of 11 (0%) in the 6 mg/kg NPC-21 and 12 mg/kg NPC-21 groups, respectively, and 5 of 38 patients (13.2%) in the placebo group (Table 2 ). There were no statistically significant differences between the groups. Additionally, the time-to-event analysis showed a trend toward delayed onset of CMV disease in the NPC-21-treated groups (Figure 2 B).\n\nAsymptomatic CMV DNAemia by week 16 was observed in 22 of 38 (57.9%), 8 of 11 (72.7%), and 17 of 38 (44.7%) patients in the 6 mg/kg NPC-21, 12 mg/kg NPC-21, and placebo groups, respectively (Table 2 ). There was no statistically significant difference between the groups. The results of the time-to-event analysis showed a similar trend (Figure 2 C).\n\nEach case of CMV disease is listed in Table 3 . Two patients experienced CMV tissue-invasive disease, and both patients were in the placebo group.\n\nThe median days to the first detection of CMV DNA in the 6 mg/kg NPC-21, 12 mg/kg NPC-21, and placebo groups were 28.5, 32.0, and 31.0 d, respectively. The median CMV viral load values first detected by the central laboratory in the 6 mg/kg NPC-21, 12 mg/kg NPC-21, and placebo groups were 226.5 (range, 110–3388), 198.0 (range, 105–589), and 371.5 (range, 105–14 454) IU/mL, respectively. There was no obvious difference in peak CMV DNA levels between the groups (Table 4 ).\n\nAdverse Events\n\nNo infusion reactions defined as adverse events of special interest were observed in this study among the 49 patients who received NPC-21. Adverse events from the first administration (day 1) to the second administration (week 4) of the study medication occurred in 201, 133, and 33 events in the placebo group, 6 mg/kg NPC-21 group, and 12 mg/kg NPC-21 group, respectively. Diarrhea, nausea, fatigue, and acute kidney injury were more common in the placebo group compared with the combined NPC-21 groups. In comparison, peripheral edema was more common in the combined NPC-21 groups. Additionally, we evaluated all adverse events from the first administration to the end of the observation period and found a similar trend to that for adverse events between the first administration (day 1) and second administration (week 4) of the study medication (Table 5 ).\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nThis was a phase 2, randomized, placebo-controlled trial to investigate the efficacy and safety of NPC-21 in KT recipients with CMV D + /R − serostatus. We found no statistically significant benefit in preventing CMV infection with NPC-21. However, the incidence of CMV disease was lower in the NPC-21 groups compared with the placebo group.\n\nTo date, 2 methods for CMV prevention have been studied in solid organ transplant recipients: universal prophylaxis and a preemptive approach. Universal prophylaxis with (val)ganciclovir showed significant benefit in D + /R − KT recipients, 7 and most recently, letermovir has shown noninferiority to valganciclovir in the same group. 9 The preemptive method showed benefits in liver transplant recipients. 20 However, additional safe prevention strategies should be required in high-risk transplant recipients.\n\nDespite the reported benefits of monoclonal antibodies against other viruses, there is a paucity of data on specific monoclonal antibodies against CMV. Tixagevimab/cilgavimab was safe and effective in the prevention of COVID-19 in solid organ transplant recipients. 21 Nirsevimab has been studied for respiratory syncytial virus in infants and was beneficial in preventing this disease in 2 studies; however, solid organ transplant recipients were excluded. 13 , 14 The idea of preventing CMV via monoclonal antibody therapy has existed for some time. NPC-21 shows neutralizing activity for cell-to-cell viral transmission among several developed CMV-specific monoclonal antibodies. 15 In the current study, NPC-21 did not prevent CMV infection but may have prevented CMV disease. CMV disease occurred in the 6 mg/kg NPC-21 group, although the incidence was lower compared with the placebo group. However, CMV disease did not occur in the 12 mg/kg NPC-21 group. Furthermore, although not obvious, there was a trend toward lower CMV DNA at first detection and peak CMV DNA within 8 wk after the first detection of CMV DNA in the NPC-21 treated groups. This tendency was especially noticeable in the high-dose group (12 mg/kg NPC-21 group). Possible CMV-related symptoms, such as acute kidney injury, were also less frequent in the NPC-21 groups versus the placebo group. However, serum monoclonal antibody levels were not analyzed in detail, and we cannot make a definitive conclusion.\n\nAlthough the monthly 6 mg/kg dose was determined on the basis of previous studies, 15 , 16 this dosage may have been insufficient to prevent CMV infection. The dosage in this study was determined on the basis of nonclinical data and phase 1 study data obtained from healthy immunocompetent individuals, 15 , 16 whereas the target population is immunocompromised individuals. There may be a difference in the required dosage between immunocompetent and immunocompromised populations. Pharmacokinetics and exposure/response analysis were planned for the current clinical study, and additional results will be presented in a follow-up report.\n\nThere are also other limitations in this study. Although we did not find significant differences between the groups, the exclusion of patients with body weight >120 kg may have caused selection bias. Additionally, we could not achieve the planned sample size owing to the COVID-19 pandemic and issues regarding the expiration date of the study medication. Furthermore, this study did not aim to compare the 6 and 12 mg/kg doses of NPC-21. Finally, if patients recovered from CMV infection before week 28, per the study protocol, the follow-up period was ended. However, a longer follow-up period may have shown benefit.\n\nIn conclusion, we performed a phase 2, randomized, placebo-controlled trial to investigate the efficacy of NPC-21 in KT recipients with CMV D + /R − serostatus. NPC-21 was safe and may potentially prevent severe disease. However, it did not reduce the rate of CMV infection. Despite these limitations, our results warrant further investigation of NPC-21. Additional studies are needed to investigate the role of NPC-21 in CMV prevention for patients with CMV + serostatus and any additive effect to treat CMV infection in immunocompromised hosts.",
