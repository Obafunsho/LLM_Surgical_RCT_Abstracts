  "title": "Intraoperative Molecular Imaging Can Identify Lung Adenocarcinomas during Pulmonary Resection",
  "abstract": "Background: Over 80,000 people undergo resection of a pulmonary tumor each year, and the only method to determine if the tumor is malignant is histological analysis. We propose that a targeted molecular contrast agent could bind lung adenocarcinomas and then identify these tumors by real-time optical imaging at the time of surgery.\n\nMethods: Fifty patients with a biopsy-proven lung adenocarcinoma were enrolled. Prior to surgery, patients were systemically administered 0.1 mg/kg of a fluorescent folate receptor alpha (FRα)-targeted molecular contrast agent by intravenous infusion. During surgery, tumors were imaged in situ and ex vivo after dissecting the lung parenchyma to directly expose the tumor to the imaging system.\n\nResults: Tumors ranged from 0.3—7.5 cm (mean 2.6cm), and 46/50 (92%) lung adenocarcinomas were fluorescent. There was no false uptake, and in 2 cases, intraoperative imaging discovered tumor metastases (3mm and 6mm) that were not recognized preoperatively. Four adenocarcinomas were not fluorescent, and immunohistochemistry showed these adenocarcinomas did not express FRα. Tumor fluorescence was independent of nodule size, 18 FDG uptake, histology, and tumor differentiation. Molecular imaging could only identify 7 out of the 50 adenocarcinomas in situ in the patient without bisection. The most important predictor of molecular imaging to locate the tumor in situ was the distance of the nodule from the pleural surface.\n\nConclusions: Intraoperative molecular imaging with a targeted contrast agent can identify lung adenocarcinomas, and this technology is currently useful in patients with subpleural tumors irrespective of size. With further refinements, this tool may prove useful in locating adenocarcinomas deeper in the lung parenchyma, lymph nodes and at pleural and resection margins.",
