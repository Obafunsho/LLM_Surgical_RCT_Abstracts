  "full_text": "Disclaimer\n\nThe Society for Vascular Surgery (SVS) develops evidenced-based clinical practice guidelines as a resource to assist members in the practice of vascular surgery. The guideline recommendations contained herein are based on a recent review of published evidence. They reflect the available body of evidence, and their applicability reflects the limitations of that data and are subject to reassessment and revision as new knowledge emerges. Given these limitations, clinical practice guidelines do not represent a statement of the standard of care, nor do they substitute for clinician judgment or supplant patient preference or shared decision-making. The Society of Vascular Surgery recognizes that departure from guidelines may be warranted when, in the reasonable judgment of the treating clinician, such course of action is indicated by the clinical presentation of the patient, limitations of available resources, advances in knowledge or technology, or patient preference. The reader must rely solely on their own judgment to determine what practices and procedures, whether included in this practice guideline or not, are appropriate for them, their patient, their institution, or their practice.\n\nIntroduction\n\nVaricose veins of the lower extremities are among the most frequent medical conditions affecting millions of people worldwide. 1 , 2 , 3 Chronic venous disease (CVD) may cause minimal symptoms, but varicose veins may often also be the source of discomfort, pain, swelling, thrombosis, bleeding, and ulcerations, causing disability and a negative impact on physical, psychological, and social functioning components of quality of life (QOL). 4 Patients with chronic venous insufficiency (CVI) may progress to phlebolymphedema, skin changes with chronic inflammation, and venous leg ulcerations. 5 , 6\n\nThe Society for Vascular Surgery (SVS), the American Venous Forum (AVF), and the American Vein and Lymphatic Society have collaborated to update the 2011 SVS/AVF guidelines on CVD, 7 and recently published Part I of the 2022 clinical practice guidelines for the management of varicose veins of the lower extremities. 8 All recommendations in Part I were based on a new, independent systematic review and meta-analysis 9 that provided the latest scientific evidence to support updated or completely new guidelines on evaluation with duplex scanning and on the management of superficial truncal reflux in patients with varicose veins. The writing committee recognized, however, that several additional important clinical issues need to be addressed, but many have varying levels of scientific evidence. 10 , 11 , 12 , 13 , 14 , 15 , 16 , 17 , 18 , 19 , 20 , 21 , 22 , 23 , 24 , 25 , 26 , 27 , 28 , 29 , 30 , 31 , 32 , 33 , 34 , 35 , 36 , 37 , 38 , 39 , 40 , 41 When a systematic review was not available, the writing committee based ungraded statements on a comprehensive review of the literature, combined with unanimous consensus of the expert panel.\n\nPart II of the guidelines focuses on the rationale and scientific evidence for prevention and management of varicose veins with compression, medications, and nutritional supplements, as well as on evaluation and treatment of varicose tributaries, factors affecting treatment outcomes, the management of superficial vein thrombosis (SVT), thrombotic complications of varicose vein treatments, thrombus extension following ablation, management of bleeding varicose veins and the treatment of superficial vein aneurysms. This comprehensive document provides a list of all recommendations (Parts I-II), as well as consensus and best practice statements to aid practitioners with up-to-date, appropriate management of patients with symptomatic lower extremity varicose veins (Clinical stage, Etiology, Anatomy, Pathology [CEAP] Class C2 disease). Updates of other, previously published society guidelines 5 , 7 , 42 , 43 will address the management of venous ulcers, associated with varicose veins (C5-C6 disease), evaluation and treatment of deep vein obstructions and chronic pelvic venous disorders.\n\nMethods\n\nA multisociety and multispecialty writing group that included 20 members authored both Part I and Part II of these varicose vein guidelines. The methods of writing Part I of the guidelines was described previously. 8 For Part II, the writing committee conducted a survey and held several meetings to compose a list of important clinical topics, not addressed in Part I, that are intended to guide comprehensive, up-to-date prevention and management of varicose veins and associated complications. A final list of 80 questions were divided into five sections, with each assigned to a writing group. The members of the groups performed an extensive search, up to January 31, 2023, of the English-language literature on their relevant topic, using the Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid Embase, PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, and Ovid Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews databases. Systematic reviews, meta-analyses, randomized controlled trials (RCTs), and prospective and retrospective observational studies that included >10 patients with varicose veins were used. Drafts of the writing groups were discussed on Zoom meetings, and all recommendations and statements were unanimously approved by the writing committee. All clinical practice guidelines in Part II were based on evidence established with one or several systematic reviews, with or without meta-analysis, using the GRADE method, 44 , 45 , 46 as described in detail in Part I of the guidelines. 8 We used the standard nomenclature of “we recommend” and “we suggest” to describe strong and weak recommendations, respectively.\n\nTo make these guidelines comprehensive and practical for clinicians, we developed three other types of ungraded statements, in addition to formal graded recommendations. Good Practice Statements are recommendations that are supported by indirect evidence that cannot be easily synthesized, yet the topic is usually noncontroversial and agreed upon by most stakeholders. 8 Implementation Remarks contain technical information that supports the implementation of specific recommendations. 47 Ungraded Consensus Statements refer to evaluation or treatment as a unanimous consensus of the expert panel, based on their own comprehensive review of the literature, even though some of the topics had minimal or low-quality evidence.\n\nRecommendations and statements\n\n1. Evaluation of patients with varicose veins\n\n1.1. Classification and grading of clinical severity of chronic venous disorders\n\n1.1.1. We recommend the use of the 2020 updated CEAP classification system for chronic venous disorders. The clinical or basic CEAP classification can be used for clinical practice, and the full CEAP classification system should be used for clinical research.\n\nGood Practice Statement\n\nRationale and evidence\n\nThe CEAP classification was designed at a consensus meeting of international experts in 1994, 48 it was updated in 2004, 49 and most recently in 2020. 50 The classification is based on clinical signs, etiology, anatomy and pathology (reflux and obstruction) of chronic venous disorders. The basic or clinical CEAP classification reports the single highest C class, and the advanced CEAP reports all C classes present in the limb. Patients with reticular veins (subdermal veins between 1 and <3 mm in diameter) and telangiectasias (subdermal spider veins, <1 mm in size) belong to Class C1. Varicose veins are dilated subcutaneous tributaries ≥3 mm in diameter and patients with varicose veins belong to CEAP Class C2. CVD is defined as CEAP Class C2 to C6, CVI includes limbs with CEAP Class 3 to 6. 49 , 50 , 51 , 52 The term CVI is reserved for advanced CVD with functional abnormalities of the venous system producing edema, skin changes, or venous leg ulcers. 51 Each clinical class has a subscript indicating the presence or absence of symptoms (s or a). Symptoms of varicose veins may include pain, burning, cramping, feeling of limb heaviness or swelling, restless leg or itching. The most important of these have been identified as HASTI symptoms and include heaviness in the legs, achiness, swelling, throbbing, and itching. 53 , 54 CEAP is a descriptive instrument designed to categorize the affected limb and not a quantitative severity scale, scoring system, or an outcome measure that reflects changes over time. For a table of the updated CEAP classification please see Part I of the Guidelines. 8\n\n1.1.2. We recommend the use of the revised Venous Clinical Severity Score (VCSS) for patients with chronic venous disorders for grading of clinical severity and for assessment of post treatment outcome.\n\nGood Practice Statement\n\nRationale and evidence\n\nThe revised VCSS is a physician-derived evaluative instrument that is useful to describe the severity of chronic venous disorders. VCSS is responsive to changes over time and is suitable to document response to treatment. VCSS, together with the CEAP classification, has been widely adopted in North American 5 , 7 and international 55 , 56 , 57 , 58 , 59 venous guidelines. The instrument comprises nine categories, each graded on a scale of 0 to 3. The categories include pain, varicose veins, edema, pigmentation, inflammation, induration, presence and size of ulcers, and use of compression therapy ( Table I ). VCSS has been validated and there is correlation between VCSS, CEAP, the modified Chronic Venous Insufficiency Questionnaire (CIVIQ) patient-reported outcome instrument and venous duplex findings. 60 61 The strongest correlation occurred in pain (r = 0.55; P < .0001). A good correlation was also found in the ability of VCSS and the Villalta-Prandoni scale to detect mild to moderate post-thrombotic CVD (gamma statistic = 0.71-0.98; P < .05). 62\n\n1.2-1.5. Evaluation with duplex ultrasound scanning\n\n1.2.1. For patients with CVD of the lower extremities, we recommend duplex ultrasound scanning (DUS) as the diagnostic test of choice to evaluate for venous reflux.\n\nGUIDELINE. Grade of recommendation: 1 (strong), Quality of Evidence: B (Moderate)\n\nFor Rationale and Evidence, please see Part I of the varicose vein guidelines. 8\n\nImplementation remarks\n\n1.3.1. Reflux is defined as a minimum value of >500 ms of reversed flow in the superficial truncal veins (great saphenous vein [GSV], small saphenous vein [SSV], anterior accessory GSV [AAGSV], posterior accessory GSV [PAGSV]) and in the tibial, deep femoral, and perforating veins. A minimum value of >1 second of reversed flow is diagnostic of reflux in the common femoral, femoral, and popliteal veins. There is no minimum diameter required to have pathologic reflux.\n\n1.3.2. Axial reflux of the GSV is defined as uninterrupted retrograde venous flow from the groin to the upper calf. Axial reflux in the SSV is defined as being from the knee to the ankle. Axial reflux in the AAGSV and PAGSV is retrograde flow between two measurements, ≥5 cm apart. Retrograde flow can occur in the superficial or deep veins, with or without perforating veins. Junctional reflux is limited to the saphenofemoral junction (SFJ) or saphenopopliteal junction (SPJ). Segmental reflux occurs in only a portion of a superficial or deep truncal vein.\n\n1.3.3. A definition of “pathologic” perforating veins in patients with varicose veins (CEAP clinical class C2 includes those with an outward flow duration of >500 ms and a diameter of >3.5 mm on DUS.\n\nFor Rationale and Evidence supporting the Implementation Remarks 1.3.1 to 1.1.3, please see Part I of the varicose vein guidelines. 8\n\nGood Practice Statements\n\n1.4.1. We recommend that evaluation of reflux with DUS be performed in an Intersocietal Accreditation Commission or American College of Radiology accredited vascular laboratory by a credentialed ultrasonographer, with the patient standing whenever possible. A sitting or reverse Trendelenburg position can be used if the patient cannot stand.\n\n1.4.2. We recommend that, for evaluation of reflux with DUS, the sonographer use either a Valsalva maneuver or distal augmentation to assess the common femoral vein and SFJ, and distal augmentation should be used with either manual compression or cuff deflation for evaluation of more distal segments. Superficial reflux must be traced to its source, including the saphenous junction, truncal or perforating veins, or pelvic origin varicose veins. The study should be interpreted by a physician trained in venous DUS interpretation.\n\n1.4.3. We recommend that a complete DUS examination for venous reflux in the lower extremities includes transverse grayscale images without and with transducer compression of the common femoral vein, proximal, mid, and distal femoral veins, popliteal veins, the SFJ, and at least two segments along the GSV and SSV.\n\n1.4.4. We recommend that a complete DUS examination for venous reflux in the lower extremities includes measurement of the spectral Doppler waveform using calipers. Reflux at baseline and in response to Valsalva or distal augmentation in the common femoral vein and at the SFJ should be documented. Reflux in response to distal augmentation in the midfemoral and popliteal veins, GSV at the proximal thigh and knee, and in the AAGSV and SSV at the SPJ or proximal calf should also be documented.\n\n1.4.5. We recommend that a complete DUS examination for venous reflux in the lower extremities includes diameter measurements with the patient’s leg in the dependent position, from the anterior to posterior wall, at the SFJ, in the GSV 1 cm distal to the SFJ, at the proximal thigh and knee, in the AAGSV, and in the SSV at the SPJ or proximal calf. Images of both normal and abnormal findings should be documented in the patient’s records.\n\nFor Rationale and Evidence supporting Good Practice Statements 1.4.1 to 1.4.5, please see Part I of the varicose vein guidelines. 8\n\nConsensus statements\n\n1.5.1. In asymptomatic patients with telangiectasias or reticular veins (CEAP Class C1), DUS evaluation of the lower extremity veins should not be performed routinely because testing could result in unnecessary saphenous vein ablation procedures.\n\nRationale\n\nAsymptomatic CEAP Class C1 venous disorder is usually a cosmetic problem; asymptomatic telangiectasias or reticular veins should not be treated for the purpose of preventing progression to more advanced venous disease. Saphenous vein ablation is not indicated in these patients for medical reasons. The GSV may need to be used in the future as a conduit for bypass in coronary or leg arteries; therefore, it should be preserved whenever possible. Thus, DUS evaluation of the venous system should not be performed.\n\nEvidence\n\nThere is no scientific evidence that complications of venous disorders can be prevented by treatment of asymptomatic telangiectasias or reticular veins. Because the GSV can be used as a conduit for bypass in coronary or leg arteries, it should be preserved whenever possible. The SVS published the “Choosing Wisely” initiative, which suggests that routine venous ultrasound testing in asymptomatic C1 patients should not be performed and that it could result in unnecessary saphenous vein ablation procedures. 63 Ruckley et al 64 found a significant but weak association between advanced telangiectasias, located at the medial thigh and GSV incompetence.\n\n1.5.2. In symptomatic CEAP Class C1 patients with bleeding or with severe symptoms of pain or burning due to moderate to severe telangiectasias or reticular veins, DUS evaluation may be performed to exclude associated venous incompetence; however, saphenous ablation for C1 disease without bleeding is rarely required.\n\nRationale\n\nDUS examination is only indicated in patients with complicated C1 disorder. The most severe complication is bleeding, but in rare cases, pain and burning due to telangiectasias or reticular veins are also indications for DUS to evaluate and treat associated superficial venous incompetence. Patients with mild symptoms and certainly those with cosmetic telangiectasias with intermittent itching or other mild symptoms do not need Duplex evaluation that could ultimately lead to unnecessary ablation of superficial truncal veins.\n\nEvidence\n\nStudies by Ruckly et al 64 suggest that there are some patients with symptomatic advanced C1 disorder, with telangiectasias and reticular veins located medially along the GSV, who are candidates for saphenous ablation. Evaluation with DUS is recommended by several groups before sclerotherapy in patients with symptomatic telangiectasias and reticular veins. 56 , 65 , 66 Engelhorn et al 67 examined 269 limbs of women with telangiectasias (CEAP C1 class). GSV reflux was detected in 44%, but it was segmental in 73% and only 4% had SFJ reflux. The authors propose further research on the management of the GSV in these patients. Interestingly, in this study 78% of the limbs with C1 disease were symptomatic. Somjen et al 65 recommended that incompetent reticular veins, present in 80% to 90% of these cases, should also be treated together with sclerotherapy of the telangiectasias. However, these larger reticular veins (1-3 mm) are always located above the superficial fascia, so they can be well-seen with magnification, or easily detected during the ultrasound guided liquid or FS. This study, therefore, does not support routine preprocedure DUS for patients with C1 disorder.\n\n1.5.3. In symptomatic patients with varicose veins (CEAP Class C2), the deep venous system should be routinely evaluated for infrainguinal obstruction or valvular incompetence.\n\nRationale\n\nDeep venous pathology, including reflux and obstruction, may affect outcomes and complications following interventions for superficial venous incompetence. Evaluation of the deep system in C2 patients with symptomatic CVD, therefore, is recommended. 8 , 68\n\nEvidence\n\nAmong 4881 patients who underwent endovenous ablation for superficial truncal vein in the Vascular Quality Initiative database, 2254 patients (46.2%) had combined deep and superficial reflux ( Table II ). After a median follow-up of 336 days, symptoms improved in both groups and improvement in VCSS score was greater in patients with deep vein reflux. These patients, however, had substantially higher rates of complications (10.4% vs 3.0%; P < .001), including paresthesia (2.5% vs 0.7%; P < .001), skin pigmentation (1.2% vs 0.4%; P = .023), superficial phlebitis (2.0% vs 0.9%; P = .018), wound infection (0.8% vs 0.2%; P = .040), and proximal thrombus extension (3.1% vs 1.1%; P < .001). After controlling for confounding factors, the estimate of effect size for any complication had an odd ratio (OR) of 5.72 ( P < .001). 74 Gianesini et al 75 retrospectively analyzed long-term results of the CHIVA procedure in 381 patients and found an increased risk of GSV reflux recurrence among those patients who initially had refluxing common femoral veins. 75 Other investigators found that ablation of superficial reflux may restore segmental competence of the deep veins 76 and that clinical outcome is excellent after superficial ablation, despite the presence of deep venous reflux. 60 , 71 In one study, those with persistent symptoms after superficial vein ablation had femoral or popliteal vein reflux velocities of >10 cm/second. 60\n\nData on infrainguinal deep vein obstruction and interventions on superficial veins are sparse because many vascular specialists avoid superficial truncal ablation in patients with extensive post-thrombotic deep vein obstruction. There is a very low level of evidence that saphenous ablation can be performed in patients with femoropopliteal venous occlusion. 77 It is important to remember that, in severely symptomatic patients with infrainguinal obstruction, the GSV may be used for deep vein reconstruction. 78 Occasionally, reconstruction of the femoral vein is needed after superficial truncal ablation in patients, who have congenital absence or severe hypoplasia of the deep veins. 79\n\nIn a systematic review of superficial venous reflux in patients with deep venous obstruction, Benfor and Peden 25 suggested that superficial ablation can be performed in patients with deep vein occlusions, but noted that the evidence to support this recommendation was weak. Most patients in this review had suprainguinal/iliofemoral obstruction and most had advanced CVD. In a series of 29 patients with a history of previous deep vein thrombosis (DVT) Puggioni et al 80 did not find an increased incidence of thrombotic complications after RFA.\n\n1.5.4. In symptomatic patients with varicose veins (CEAP Class C2), evaluation for iliofemoral venous obstruction with DUS or with other imaging studies should be performed if suprapubic or abdominal wall varicosities are present and in patients with symptoms of proximal obstruction, including thigh and leg fullness, heaviness, swelling and venous claudication. CEAP Classes 3 through 6 warrant DUS or other imaging studies to evaluate for iliofemoral obstruction.\n\nRationale\n\nVaricose veins can be associated with primary or secondary iliofemoral venous obstruction. Although many C2 patients with simple varicose veins need no evaluation for proximal venous obstruction, those who have more advanced symptoms or signs (C3-C6) due to iliofemoral disease need further investigation and appropriate treatment.\n\nEvidence\n\nIn a recent systematic review of 944 limbs with previous DVT or current deep vein obstruction, most patients had iliofemoral venous disease and advanced CEAP class (C4-C6). 25 These patients had better results when vein ablation was combined with treatment of iliac vein obstruction. It should be noted, however, that few C2 patients were included in the review leaving this issue unexplored and unresolved. In the case of iliofemoral venous obstruction, interventions on the superficial venous system should not impair venous return from the limb. For this reason, in patients with symptoms of proximal outflow obstruction, like venous claudication, thigh swelling and pain, or in those with suprapubic or abdominal wall varicosities, or with continuous flow and lack of respiratory variations in the common femoral vein on DUS, investigation of the iliac veins is warranted. During ablation of the incompetent superficial veins, collaterals to the suprapubic and abdominal wall veins should be preserved.\n\n1.5.5. In patients with medial thigh or vulvar varicosities, evaluation of pelvic venous pathology with DUS or other imaging studies is not indicated if they have no symptoms of pelvic venous disease.\n\nRationale\n\nThere is an association between pelvic venous insufficiency and medial thigh and vulvar varicosities, and lower extremity varicosities are often more severe in patients with associated pelvic varicose veins. 81 Although ovarian vein embolization in patients with pelvic venous disorders may be helpful for lower extremity varicosities, embolization in patients with varicose vein without chronic pelvic pain has not been studied. In contrast, direct treatment of pelvic origin lower extremity, vulvar, or perineal varicose veins without ovarian vein embolization can be effective and durable. 82\n\nEvidence\n\nNonsaphenous, pelvic origin varicose veins occur in women in the medial and posterior thigh, vulva, and inguinal area. 83 They are the result of reflux from the internal iliac vein through the inguinal, obturator, perineal and gluteal escape points. 42 Vulvar varicosities are estimated to occur in 22% to 34% of women with varicose veins of the pelvis and in 18% to 22% of pregnant women. 82\n\nSeventy-two symptomatic patients with pelvic source varicose veins, however, only 7% had chronic pelvic pain. 84 In a systematic review of 13 studies on ovarian vein embolization in 866 women, technical success was 99.8%; significant improvement of pelvic pain was reported in nine studies. 85 In one study, lower extremity varicosities recurred only in 13% at 5 years after embolization. 85 Hartung et al 86 reported 51% improvement in lower extremity varicosity following ovarian vein embolization in 119 women, who had both pelvic symptoms and lower extremity varicose veins. In another study of 43 patients, Castenmiller et al 87 showed improvement after ovarian vein embolization in the lower extremity varicose veins in 14%, but the success rate was 88% for treatment of vulvar varicose veins.\n\nGavrilov reported good clinical results with direct treatment of vulvar varicosities with FS and phlebectomy. 82 In 32 patients with asymptomatic pelvic varicose veins, phlebectomy alone for vulvar varices resulted in no recurrence at 3 to 8 years after the procedure. Sclerotherapy was effective at 1 year in 10 of 12 patients. 82 Current consensus of experts supports the strategy of direct treatment of pelvic origin varicose veins in patients with asymptomatic pelvic reflux using liquid or FS, phlebectomy, or pelvic escape points ligation, without the need for pelvic vein embolization. 56 , 82 , 83\n\n2. Compression therapy\n\n2.1. Compression therapy vs intervention\n\n2.1.1. For patients with symptomatic varicose veins and axial reflux in the superficial truncal veins, we suggest compression therapy for primary treatment if the patient’s ambulatory status or underlying medical conditions warrant a conservative approach or, if the patient prefers conservative treatment, for either a trial period or definitive management.\n\nGUIDELINE. Grade of recommendation: 2 (weak), Quality of Evidence: C (low to very low)\n\nRationale\n\nIn patients with varicose veins, compression therapy has been used for decades to decrease pain and swelling. Graduated elastic compression stockings oppose tissue expansion when muscles contract. It can narrow the superficial veins diameter and therefore decrease the venous reflux and venous hypertension, key elements in the pathophysiology of CVD.\n\nEvidence\n\nThe clinical benefit of compression stockings for the initial treatment of varicose veins has been studied in a recent Cochrane review of 13 trials, encompassing >1000 patients 88 ( Table III ). Compression stockings were compared with no stockings or placebo stockings. 88 Four RCTs showed improvement in symptoms, but they were subject to bias. Three of the four studies reported side effects of discomfort, appearance, and application difficulty. The benefits of stockings were offset by highly variable reports of compliance, presumably due to the most common side effects of itching and irritation. Graduated compression stockings are classified according to the pressure applied at the level of the ankle: Class 1, low-pressure stockings exert an ankle pressure <20 mm Hg; Class 2, moderate compression is between 20 and 30 mm Hg; and Class 3 stocking are high compression stockings with ankle pressures of >30 mm Hg. 89 When comparing against different levels of compression and lengths of stockings, there was no clear difference in this Cochrane review. 88 Patient preference for one stocking over another was largely driven by comfort. None of the studies assessed QOL. Overall, there was insufficient high quality of evidence to determine whether compression stockings are effective as the primary treatment for symptomatic varicose veins and if one stocking is better than the other. 88 Real-world data suggest that compliance with compression stockings can be as low as 37%. 90 For additional evidence, see Part I of the Guidelines. 8\n\n2.1.2. For patients with symptomatic varicose veins and axial reflux in the GSV or SSV who are candidates for intervention, we recommend superficial venous intervention over long-term compression stockings.\n\nGUIDELINE. Grade of recommendation: 1 (strong), Quality of Evidence: B (moderate)\n\n2.1.3. For patients with symptomatic varicose veins and axial reflux in the AAGSV or PAGSV who are candidates for intervention, we suggest superficial venous intervention over long-term compression stockings.\n\nGUIDELINE. Grade of recommendation: 2 (weak), Quality of Evidence: C (low to very low)\n\nFor Rationale and Evidence for Guidelines 2.1.2. to 2.1.3, see Part I of the varicose vein guidelines. 8\n\n2.1.4. In patients with symptomatic varicose veins who are candidates for endovenous therapy and wish to proceed with treatment, we suggest against a 3-month trial of compression therapy prior intervention.\n\nGUIDELINE. Grade of recommendation: 2 (weak), Quality of Evidence: B (moderate)\n\nRationale\n\nThere is no rationale for a 3-month trial of compression therapy before intervention for patients with CEAP C2 class symptomatic varicose veins who are candidates for endovenous therapy and wish to proceed. Evidence for efficacy of compression therapy in these patients is less than for efficacy of endovenous ablation ( Table IV ).\n\nEvidence\n\nInsurance companies and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services frequently require a 3-month trial of compression stockings before intervention for patients with C2 disease, despite a lack of evidence for efficacy. 90 In a UK-based cost analysis, 91 accounting for clinical recurrences and need for further treatment, analysis included cost of procedure and subsequent procedures and quality-adjusted life-years. Across all measures, compression therapy was found to be inferior to minimally invasive endovenous therapies (including ultrasound-guided FS [UGFS] and endovenous thermal ablation). 91 Although the cost effectiveness was calculated for the UK, sensitivity analysis suggests that the conclusions are robust to substantial changes in relative cost, and pertinent to other global healthcare markets.\n\nAs an example, the REACTIV Trial, in which a subgroup of patients with severe varicosities were randomized to surgical therapy (HL&S, phlebectomy) compared with compression therapy. 92 Consistently, surgical therapy produced better results with regards to anatomical disease extent, patient satisfaction, QOL, and cost effectiveness. 92\n\n2.2. Compression therapy after intervention\n\n2.2.1. In patients undergoing thermal ablation for saphenous incompetence, with or without concomitant phlebectomy, we suggest postprocedure compression therapy for a minimum of 1 week for pain reduction.\n\nGUIDELINE: Grade of recommendation: 2 (weak), Quality of Evidence: B (Moderate)\n\nRationale\n\nCompression therapy has been used to reduce postoperative bleeding, bruising, edema, and pain after thermal ablation of superficial venous trunks. 93 The type of compression therapy prescribed following treatment of varicose veins is widely variable and driven by institutional-, physician-, and insurer-level preferences. Most commonly, postprocedural compression therapy is delivered with gradient elastic compression stockings or elastic bandages. The presence of a pressure gradient, with the strongest compression at the level of the ankle and lightest at the top provides the most favorable hemodynamic profile for reducing limb edema. Stockings are constructed in various lengths, such as knee high or thigh high, with variable levels of compression. Compression levels range from I to III, with I representing the lowest level of compression and III the highest. Similarly, elastic stockings vary in compressive properties based on the length and type of bandage used.\n\nEvidence\n\nThe use of compression therapy after ablation of superficial truncal veins is controversial. 94 In a meta-analysis including six RCTs with patients Class C2 or higher, those treated with compression had less pain within the first 10 days postoperatively, and earlier return to daily activities. 13 No differences were noted in bruising score, VCSS, QOL, complications, or vein occlusion rate. A subgroup analysis of a meta-analysis, encompassing 1147 patients, suggested that the greatest benefits in pain reduction were in patients undergoing endovenous laser ablation (EVLA), with no benefit seen after RFA. 26 This finding is consistent with other studies demonstrating greater pain with EVLA compared with RFA. 95 , 96 An RCT by Bootun et al 97 demonstrated a clear benefit of compression leading to significantly better pain scores for the first 5 days after endothermal ablation of saphenous veins. Compression was effective in reducing early pain also in patients who underwent concurrent phlebectomies ( Table V ).\n\nThe duration of therapy has been studied in the context of short-term (24-48 hours), mid-term (1-2 weeks), and long-term (3-6 weeks) therapy. A meta-analysis of 775 patients undergoing endothermal ablation found a difference in postoperative pain at 1 week but not at later time points in patients undergoing 1-2 weeks of compression compared with those with 24 to 48 hours. 99 Long-term therapy has been shown to have equivalent outcomes to midterm therapy. 98 Therefore, application of compression for 1 week after any endothermal treatment, especially those with concurrent phlebectomy may be useful for pain reduction. In the recently published multicenter society guidelines, a compression dressing of >20 mm Hg (corresponding with class II compression stocking pressure) with eccentric pads over the ablation point is recommended for patients undergoing vein ablation for greatest reduction in postoperative pain. 100\n\n3. Drugs and nutritional supplements\n\n3.1. In symptomatic patients with varicose veins, who are not candidates for intervention, who are waiting for intervention or have symptoms after intervention, we suggest micronized purified flavonoid fraction (MPFF) or Ruscus extracts for treatment of vein related pain, leg heaviness and/or sensation of swelling.∗\n\nGUIDELINE: Grade of recommendation: 2 (weak), Quality of Evidence: B (Moderate)\n\n3.2. In symptomatic patients with varicose veins, who are not candidates for intervention, who are waiting for intervention or have symptoms after intervention, we suggest hydroxyethylrutosides or calcium dobesilate or horse chestnut extract or red vine leaf extract or sulodexide for treatment of vein-related pain, leg heaviness, night cramps, and/or sensation of swelling.∗\n\nGUIDELINE: Grade of recommendation: 2 (weak), Quality of Evidence: C (Low to very low)\n\n∗These products are not approved drugs by the US Food and Drug Administration. The US Food and Drug Administration does not approve medical food or nutritional supplements ( https://www.fda.gov/ ).\n\nRationale\n\nVenoactive drugs (VADs), also called phlebotropics or phlebotonics, have shown varying benefits in patients with chronic venous disorders. VADs have been largely prescribed in Europe and other parts of the world, 101 but recently they have gained interest in the United States, where they are available now, mainly as nutritional supplements. 102 , 103 The most frequently used VADs include MPFF, diosmin, Ruscus extracts, hydroxyethylrutosides, calcium dobesilate, horse chestnut extract/escin, and red vine leaf extract. Sulodexide does not belong to the VAD family, but it has been used for CVD ( Table VI ). Pentoxifylline is a vasoactive agent that has been beneficial in patients with claudication and venous ulcers but it has not been studied in patients with C2 varicose veins.\n\nEvidence\n\nThe efficacy and safety of VADs was extensively studied in patients with CVD in double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trials and meta-analyses. There have been two Cochrane reviews, the most recent in 2020, that included a systematic review and meta-analysis of 7690 patients, enrolled in 56 studies. 104 , 105 The VAD used included rutosides, hidrosmine and diosmin, calcium dobesilate, Centella asiatica, aminaftone, French maritime pine bark extract, and grape seed extract. Diosmin is only one component of MPFF, and MPFF studies were analyzed together with nonmicronized diosmin trials. Most studies included patients with varicose veins (C2), but also with more advanced CVI, like venous edema (C3), skin changes (C4-C5), venous ulcers (C6). Pooled data analysis of VADs was given, although the document also includes breakdown of the different effect of individual products as well. The number of patients included in many studies was low and the follow-up was short. The review found moderate-certainty evidence that phlebotonics in patients with CVI probably reduced edema in the lower legs, compared with placebo (risk ratio [RR] 0.70; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.63-0.78; 13 studies; 1245 participants); and probably reduced ankle circumference (MD, –4.27 mm; 95% CI, –5.61 to –2.93 mm; 15 studies; 2010 participants). Moderate-certainty evidence showed that phlebotonics probably make little or no difference in QOL compared with placebo (standard mean difference [SMD], –0.06; 95% CI, –0.22 to 0.10; five studies; 1639 participants); and low-certainty of evidence suggested that they may have little or no effect on ulcer healing (RR, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.79-1.13; six studies; 461 participants). There was low certainty of evidence that phlebotonics may reduce pain, measured as a continuous variable, compared with placebo (SMD, –0.35; 95% CI, –0.54 to –0.17; 12 studies; 2232 participants). Thirty-seven studies reported on adverse events; the most frequent were gastrointestinal symptoms. Findings for specific groups of VADs were limited due to small study numbers in some studies and the heterogeneous results. The authors downgraded certainty in the evidence from high to moderate because of risk of bias concerns, and further to low because of imprecision. It is clear from this review and multiple other meta-analyses, 14 , 15 , 16 , 112 however, that some of these drugs or supplements are better than the others.\n\nThe clinical benefits of two compounds, MPFF and Ruscus extracts, have been studied more extensively in double-blind, placebo-controlled RCTs and meta-analyses and they are discussed in more detail here. For evidence of clinical efficacy of other VADs, including hydroxyethylrutosides, calcium dobesilate, horse chestnut extract, red vine leaf extract and sulodexide for treatment of CVD, see Appendix I . Most studies with these products have short (3-6 months) follow-ups; therefore, long-term efficacy and possible side effects of long-term treatment have not been formally assessed.\n\nClinical benefit of MPFF\n\nRationale\n\nMPFF is composed of 90% diosmin and 10% hesperidin fraction (hesperidin, diosmetin, linarin, and isorhoifolin). Its beneficial effects in patients with symptomatic varicose veins are related to the effect on venous tone, microcirculation, trophic disorders, edema, inflammation, leukocyte adhesion, and activation. 101 Pharmaceutic formulations that increase intestinal absorption as micronized form, including the MPFF represent an innovation and improvement of the therapeutic efficacy.\n\nEvidence\n\nMPFF has shown several effects beneficial for patients with varicose veins and CVD. Among them are an increase of the venous tone, potentiation of the venous response to norepinephrine, 106 and antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. 107 , 108 Leukocytes adhesion molecules inhibition was confirmed in patients with CEAP Class C2 to C4, in parallel to the improvement of leg heaviness scores. 109 Transient venous reflux was reduced in patients with telangiectasias and reticular veins treated with MPFF. 110\n\nA meta-analysis by Kakkos and Nicolaides 14 analyzed seven RCTs in 1692 patients with CVD ( Table VII ). Based on high-quality evidence, the study concluded that MPFF was highly effective in improving leg symptoms, edema, and QOL in patients with CVD. The RELIEF study enrolled 4527 patients with CEAP Class C0 to C4. Approximately 40% of patients belonged to CEAP Class C2. Participants were treated for a period of 6 months and had significant evolving improvement of symptoms, QOL measured by the CIVIQ instrument and edema assessed by leg circumference. 111 More recently, an RCT compared two galenic formulations of MPFF, tablets and sachets, and included 1139 patients with C2s stage representing 44.95% to 49.46%. 113 The authors concluded that both formulations resulted in similar improvement of symptoms and QOL.\n\nA meta-analysis of 10 trials included 1010 patients treated with MPFF, hydroxyethylrutosides, ruscus extracts, and diosmin. MPFF significantly reduced ankle edema ( P < .0001), while the efficacy of the other two VADS was comparable. 112 Another meta-analysis 15 compared the efficacy of sulodexide, MPFF, hydroxyethyl rutosides, calcium dobesilate, ruscus extracts, horse chestnut extracts, and pentoxifylline. The primary outcome was ulcer healing, but the drug effects on the leg volume, ankle circumference, symptoms, as well as QOL (CIVIQ-20 score) were also assessed. MPFF had superior effectiveness in leg volume reduction, pain, and improved QOL. Although not within the scope of this guideline, it is worth mentioning that in a meta-analysis of five RCTs, MPFF improved ulcer healing. 15 , 114 The main MPFF component, diosmin, is effective alone, although its efficacy is significantly less than that of MPFF. 112 , 115\n\nFive unblinded open-label clinical trials were included in a systematic review investigating the effects of VADs on recovery after surgery, endovenous ablation, or sclerotherapy 20 ( Table VIII ). All used MPFF; in one study, sulodexide was also given. Three studies reported significantly less postprocedural pain, one observed no significant effect. Two studies reported significant reduction in postprocedural bleeding. Three studies reported greater symptomatic improvement with MPFF treatment. Based on these results, MPFF may help to reduce postprocedural pain, hemorrhage, and CVD-specific symptoms. These benefits appear to be greater when treatment is started 2 weeks before the procedure. When VAD treatment was started only after varicose veins surgery, 117 no benefit was noted.\n\nIn a nonrandomized, controlled multicenter prospective study (DEFANCE trial), 118 245 C2 patients underwent HL&S combined with stab avulsion. Patients in one group (n = 200) received 1000 mg of MPFF daily, the control group (n = 45) had no drug treatment. Compression (class 2) was prescribed for 4 weeks after surgery for all patients. Hematoma ( P < .05) and pain (VAS) ( P < .05) were significantly lower in the MPFF group. The same results were observed for leg heaviness and fatigue. As discussed, however, compression for 1 week after endothermal treatment has also been useful for pain reduction, without MPFF treatment.\n\nClinical benefit of ruscus extracts\n\nRationale\n\nRuscus extracts increase capillary resistance and reduce capillary filtration. 119\n\nEvidence\n\nA systematic review and meta-analysis 120 included 20 RCT vs placebo, five vs comparative VAD (hydroxyrutosides and MPFF), and six observational studies, with a total of 10,246 patients ( Table IX ). Varicose veins were listed in the inclusion criteria of some of the trials (eg, Capelli 121 ), most of them focusing on CVI with CEAP class from C2 to C5. Data quality was heterogeneous, but the study concluded that Ruscus extracts significantly improved symptoms compared with placebo. The best effects were observed on leg heaviness ( P = .001), pain ( P = .02), cramps ( P = .025), and paresthesia ( P = .031). Venous capacity, assessed by plethysmography, decreased by 0.7 mL/100 mL compared with placebo ( P = .014). Comparison with hydroxyrutoside and MPFF showed similar effects on the symptoms. A more recent systematic review and meta-analysis 16 included 10 high-quality, double-blind, placebo-controlled RCTs with a total number of 719 patients (CEAP C2-C5). Compared with placebo, the RR for pain was 0.35 ( P < .00,001), for heaviness 0.26 ( P < .00001), for sensation of swelling 0.53 ( P < .0001), for paresthesia 0.27 ( P < .0001), and for global symptoms 0.54 ( P < .00001). Ankle circumference and leg volume were significant reduced, and the study concluded that Ruscus extracts were effective in reducing symptoms and edema in patients with CVD. 16 In a meta-analysis, 112 Ruscus extracts significantly reduced ankle circumference vs placebo ( P < .001), more so than diosmin. Another systematic review and meta-analysis 15 found that Ruscus extracts were the most effective in decreasing foot volume and ankle circumference.\n\n4.

Factors affecting choice of superficial truncal ablation and outcomes\n\n5.1.1. In symptomatic patients with C2 disease, we suggest against using truncal vein diameter to determine which patients need venous ablation.\n\nGUIDELINE: Grade of recommendation: 2 (weak), Quality of Evidence: B (moderate)\n\nRationale\n\nA commonly accepted diameter threshold for ablation of the GSV or the SSV has been 5 mm. However, data show that ablation of veins <5 mm in diameter also improves symptoms. 122 , 123\n\nEvidence\n\nSeveral studies demonstrated a weak correlation between saphenous vein diameter and increased CEAP clinical class or VCSS; a correlation between QOL and saphenous vein diameter has not been found. 122 , 124 Most studies segregated veins diameters into >5 mm or <5 mm. Tan et al 124 performed a systematic review of 11 studies and 2732 limbs. Four studies correlated truncal vein diameter with QOL, while seven reported only on clinical severity measures. Four studies found a weak correlation between vein diameter and VCSS, while one demonstrated correlation with VCSS components. 124 The diameters were a poor predictor of HRQOL, with no relationship to patients’ perceived impact on CVD. The review concluded that vein diameters should not be used as a single determinant of who needs venous intervention. 124 Perrins et al examined the clinical and anatomical outcomes of RFA of symptomatic small-diameter GSVs. 122 RFA of symptomatic small diameter GSV (<5 mm) provided comparable clinical outcomes (vein closure and improved VCSS at 3 months) and the study suggested that patients with GSV size <5 mm benefit from RFA. 122 Bendix et al 123 reviewed the Vascular Quality Initiative VV Registry and divided patients into those with GSV <5 mm (group 1) vs those with GSV ≥5 mm (group 2). Both groups had improvement in the VCSS and HASTI scores. Group 2 had more complications, more adverse VTE events, required more anticoagulation, developed more recanalization and missed more days of work than group 1. They authors concluded that patients with a smaller vein size should not be denied intervention based on size alone. 123\n\n5.2.1. In asymptomatic patients with C2 disease, prophylactic intervention does not prevent progression of venous disease. Weight control, compression stockings, and avoiding prolonged standing may be beneficial.\n\nConsensus statement\n\nRationale\n\nStudies have noted progression with worsening CEAP class over time. 125 , 126 , 127 This raises the question about the role of prophylactic intervention in asymptomatic patients with varicose veins, to prevent progression to symptomatic disease.\n\nEvidence\n\nAs discussed before, the CEAP classification is not a severity scale but a classification scheme for patients with chronic venous disorders describing the clinical, etiologic, anatomical, and pathophysiologic features. Conceptually, however, it has often been pondered whether patients with varicose veins (C2) can undergo treatment to prevent progression to CVI later in life. In the Bonn Vein Study, 128 1978 participants were followed up for a mean of 6.6 years. The prevalence of varicose veins rose from 22.7% to 25.1% ( Table X ). Participants with C2 disease increased to higher C-classes in 19.8% for nonsaphenous varicose veins and in 31.8% for saphenous varicose veins. The main risk factor for progression was obesity. The Edinburgh Vein Study had a 13-year follow-up; a progression rate of 57.8% (4.3% per year) was reported, of those with C2 disease at baseline, 31.9% progressed to CVI. 126 Risk factors for progression included a family history of varicose veins, previous DVT and obesity. Kostas et al followed 73 mostly asymptomatic contralateral limbs for 5 years in patients who underwent treatment of symptomatic varicose veins of one lower extremity. CVD progression was significantly less in patients who were not obese and did not gain weight during the study. 125 Patients who did not use compression stockings preoperatively and during the follow-up or had stopped using them also had significantly higher incidence of progression compared with those who used compression. 125\n\nA Cochrane study in 2013 looked at nonpharmacological interventions to prevent CVI in standing workers. 132 This systemic review concluded that due to the limited number of trials and study participants, there was insufficient evidence to draw any conclusions as to whether nonpharmacologic strategies including compression were effective at preventing the development of CVI in standing workers. Another systematic review of compression for uncomplicated C2 disease found no consensus on the class of compression needed for the effective management of varicose veins and no evidence that wearing compression slows the progression or recurrence of varicose veins. 129 Although evidence presented in these guidelines show that interventions on varicose veins are associated with improved QOL and decreased morbidity, no study examined the role of surgical or endovascular therapies on C2 patients to prevent longitudinal progression to CVI. The role of treatment in preventing such progression remains undefined.\n\n5.2.2. Interventions to treat varicose veins can be performed in an office-based setting, surgery center, or hospital operating room, at the discretion of the physician, who is specialized in vein care. Better patient experience and lower cost was reported for procedures performed in an office-based setting.\n\nConsensus statement\n\nRationale\n\nIn the United States, most venous disease practitioners perform venous procedures, including thermal or nonthermal endovenous ablation, miniphlebectomy and sclerotherapy in an office-based setting. A comparison with the historical method of providing such interventions in the hospital operating room or in surgical centers helps guide providers.\n\nEvidence\n\nEndovenous procedures are safe and effective with high patient satisfaction when performed in an office-based setting ( Table XI ). Studies have shown high technical success for venous interventions in the office-based setting, which is on par with the operating room setting. 135 , 137 , 138 Venous procedures in the office-based setting have a low overall complication rate, comparable with most published series that evaluated similar interventions in the operating room. 135 , 138 , 133 Jain et al found that 99% of patients surveyed indicated they would come back to the office for additional procedures. 133 Perkowski et al treated 165 patients in an outpatient office setting with EVLA of either the GSV, SSV, or accessory saphenous veins. No DVT or nerve injury were reported and 97% of patients were mostly or very satisfied with their treatment results. 134 In a retrospective study of 429 office based stand-alone RFA procedures, performed under local tumescent anesthesia in 394 patients with varicose veins, Somasundaram et al reported >75% had resolution of symptoms within 1 year, with 3 endothermal heat-induced thrombosis (EHITs) and no major complications. Only 23% needed additional treatments. 135 Cost was significantly lower when compared with RFA procedures performed in a day surgery setting. 135 Combining thermal ablation and other venous treatments such as phlebectomy and sclerotherapy during the same procedure is also safe and effective. Jarjous et al treated 72 extremities in 63 consecutive patients with RFA of the truncal and perforator veins, combined with UGFS procedures of tributary and accessory veins. 136 They reported 100% closure of the treated GSV and SSV and 91.7% closure of tributary veins, 13.9% needed additional treatment and there were no major or minor complications. 136 Lin et al reported on 3073 office-based venous procedures: 285 saphenous vein ablations, 185 miniphlebectomies, and 261 venous ablations with concomitant miniphlebectomy. 137 Overall technical success was 99.2%, with a complication rate of 1%. 137 There are a few studies that looked at patient satisfaction in an office setting compared with an operating room setting. Varetto et al treated 112 patients with GSV insufficiency. Approximately one-half underwent EVLA in day-surgery and one-half in an outpatient office-based setting. There was no statistical difference in the postoperative success or complications between the two groups. 138 QOL measures did not significantly differ between groups, except for the >65-year-old group, which demonstrated better QOL in office-based setting compared with the day surgery group. 138 Another prospective study sent questionnaires to patients who underwent endovenous ablation with concomitant phlebectomy in the office-based setting and found a high (98.1%) satisfaction level, with 94.7% of the patients stating they would undergo the same procedure again in the same setting, if needed. 139 In summary, varicose vein procedures in the office-based setting have a low complication rate, high patient satisfaction and they are cost effective.\n\nIt is important to note, however, that appropriate treatment of patients with venous disease is dependent not just on evidence-based guidelines, but that physicians and qualified health care professionals have the requisite education, training and skills to provide such care. In the context of interventional venous procedures, multispecialty agreement has been reached on the required training and experience needed for physicians to perform specific venous treatments. 140 In addition, the role and degree of involvement by licensed advanced practice providers, physician assistants and nurse practitioners, has also been defined by the Intersocietal Accreditation Commission, along with that of nursing staff and ultrasound technologists. Because these venous interventions are mostly performed in the private office or office-based laboratory setting, the supervising physician has the responsibility to ensure that any procedure, or parts of procedures, not personally performed by them is done by an appropriately qualified and licensed individual under sufficient level of supervision.\n\n5.2.3. In patients with symptomatic C2 disease, isolated SFJ incompetence does not justify ablation of an otherwise competent GSV.\n\nConsensus statement\n\nRationale\n\nThe impact of junctional reflux on clinical manifestations and treatment outcomes is not clear. Reflux patterns and the presence or absence of SFJ reflux have been evaluated in multiple studies and a significant percentage of symptomatic patients have been shown to have lower extremity reflux without SFJ insufficiency. 141 , 142 , 143 Nevertheless, the presence of junctional reflux often determines insurance coverage for ablation. Assessing the role that junctional reflux plays in patients with symptomatic varicose veins is important to ensure appropriate care.\n\nEvidence\n\nStudies have indicated that the theory of descending saphenous valvular incompetence starting at the SFJ may be inaccurate and therefore there is no rationale for treatment of SFJ incompetence in the setting of a normal GSV. 141 , 142 , 143 Abu-Own et al 141 used DUS to assess 190 limbs with primary varicose veins. Sixty-three limbs (33%) had no SFJ incompetence. Labropoulos et al 144 looked at 255 limbs in 217 patients with superficial venous insufficiency and normal deep veins and perforator veins with DUS. Isolated below-knee reflux was associated with more symptoms and signs than isolated above-knee reflux. 144 Another study by Labropoulos et al 142 looked at the prevalence of reflux in age-matched asymptomatic young patients and found that reflux can occur in any vein segment and the most common site was the below knee GSV. Fassiadis et al studied 611 limbs with primary varicose veins. Of 454 limbs that showed GSV reflux on DUS, 240 limbs exhibited reflux of both the GSV and SFJ and 214 limbs (35%) showed isolated GSV reflux with a competent SFJ. The authors suggested that reflux starts distally and progresses proximally. 143 In light of these studies, treatment of isolated SFJ reflux appears unnecessary.\n\n5.2.4. In patients with symptomatic C2 disease, ablation of the incompetent GSV may be indicated even if the axial reflux is not complete and the SFJ is competent. Ablation of isolated refluxing GSV segments, in the presence of competent segments proximally and distally, is rarely indicated. Shared decision-making with the patient is warranted.\n\nConsensus statement\n\nRationale and evidence\n\nReflux patterns have been evaluated in multiple studies, and as discussed above, a significant percentage of symptomatic patients have been shown to have lower extremity axial reflux without SFJ insufficiency. Engelhorn et al 145 found SFJ incompetence in only 12% of 590 limbs of 326 women with varicose and spider veins (CEAP Class C1-C2). Aurshina et al 146 in their single-center retrospective review of 265 patients including 41 without junctional reflux noted that the location of reflux did not affect patient presentation or outcomes at two years after vein ablation. Others reported more advanced clinical disease in patients with reflux involving the SFJ. 147 The common observation in these studies is that early ablation of the GSV results in good outcome in symptomatic patients, who have competent SFJ but incompetent distal thigh or upper calf GSV.\n\nIn contrast, segmental or complete ablation of the GSV is rarely indicated for isolated refluxing segments with competent segments proximally and distally ( Table XII ). The GSV has an average of 6.7 valves (range, 3-11 valves). 149 Isolated segmental reflux may be identified by ultrasound even in the presence of a competent GSV. Such a phenomenon may occur in a segment between two competent valves when inflow occurs from a competent tributary and outflow from an incompetent tributary or a competent perforator between the two valves. 150 When symptomatic, such incompetent tributaries can be managed with phlebectomy.\n\n5.2.5. In patients with reflux in the below-knee GSV, ablation to the lowest point of reflux resulted in better early outcome. Nonthermal techniques are preferred for ablation of refluxing distal calf saphenous veins to avoid thermal nerve injury.\n\nConsensus statement\n\nRationale\n\nStudies have shown that thermal ablation of the below-knee GSV is feasible and safe. 151 In addition, nonthermal techniques are available if there are concerns about saphenous nerve injury. Elimination of below-knee GSV reflux has been shown to improve symptoms and reduce the need for additional procedures, compared with ablation of the above-knee GSV only. 152 , 153 , 154\n\nEvidence\n\nSeveral studies showed better results of above-knee GSV ablation when there was no residual below-knee GSV reflux. 152 , 153 In a systematic review, Sussman et al 33 found that above-knee-below-knee EVLA was associated with significantly lower odds of below-knee GSV reflux recurrence compared with above-knee-EVLA only ( P < .0001). Theivacumar et al 152 randomized 68 limbs of 65 patients with varicosities and both above-knee and below-knee GSV reflux to either EVLA above-knee, EVLA to below-knee midcalf, or above-knee EVLA with concomitant below-knee FS. There was improvement in the Aberdeen Varicose Vein Severity Score at 6 weeks in all groups, although it was greater in the latter two groups; patient satisfaction at twelve weeks was not different between the groups. Compared with above-knee EVLA, concomitant below-knee ablation (laser or sclerotherapy) resulted in fewer varicosities and superior symptom relief at 6 weeks ( Table XIII ). 152 In another study the same authors treated 69 limbs with above-knee EVLA, 40 with C2 disease. 153 At 6 weeks, residual varicosities, if present, were treated with FS. Reflux in the below-knee GSV was evaluated, and the limbs were allocated into three groups: group A, no reflux; group B, flash reflux <1 second; and group C, significant reflux >1 second. Delayed FS was required in 12% in group A, 14% in group B, and 89% in group C. The improvement in Aberdeen Varicose Vein Severity Score at 6 weeks was 86.2% in group A, 82.1% in group B, and 59.1% in group C ( P < .001 vs A and B). While EVLA of the above-knee GSV improved all patients, those with persistent reflux in the below-knee GSV had the least improvement. In a different study of 50 patients with complete GSV reflux, 16 patients had EVLA in the above-knee and below-knee GSV in separate sessions, 34 patients had EVLA in the above-knee and below-knee GSV in the same session. 154 Patients with complete GSV reflux complained of ankle pain and swelling. At 11 months, all patients had resolution of their ankle pain, with 44 patients having resolution of swelling. There were four instances of paresthesias. 154 Carradice et al randomized surgical stripping vs EVLA for treatment of varicose veins. Twelve of 23 recurrences of varicosities were due to an incompetent below-knee GSV. GSV ablation in this study could be safely performed in the distal leg. 155 Gifford et al treated 79 limbs with below-knee-GSV EVLT or RFA for reflux at this site, 43 had Class 1 to 3 disease. Only three patients (4%) suffered transient paresthesia.\n\n5.2.6. In patients with an epifascial or superficial saphenous vein, thermal ablation may result in skin burns, hyperpigmentation, or induration, while nonthermal techniques may cause hyperpigmentation or induration. Miniphlebectomy or limited stripping is safe and effective, if the saphenous vein is close to the skin (<0.5 cm) .\n\nConsensus statement\n\nRationale\n\nThermal techniques pose the potential for skin burn if the area of ablation is close to the skin. Use of tumescence anesthesia helps overcome this problem in most cases. Nonthermal nontumescent techniques may also be used, although it is not known whether one technique is superior to others for veins close to the skin.\n\nEvidence\n\nThere is no scientific evidence that supports one type of ablation technique over another, based on depth of vein below the skin. The risk of skin burns appears to be high in limbs with the vein located <0.5 cm from the skin despite using subdermal tumescent anesthesia. Pigmentation has also been observed in these patients. In a systematic review and network analysis that included 51 studies on EVLA, RFA, n-butyl cyanoacrylate ablation or FS, Gasior et al 156 did not report on skin burn as a complication. In the 16 studies that Alozai et al 29 included in their systematic review/meta-analysis of treatment modalities of the AAGSV, there was a 0.7% incidence of paresthesia with no instances of skin burn. The ablation modalities included RFA, EVLA, n-butyl cyanoacrylate and sclerotherapy. 29 The MARADONA trial, a multicenter randomized study that compared MOCA to RFA, did not find a significant difference in the incidence of skin burn or saphenous neuralgia between the two techniques at 30 days. 157\n\n5.2.7. For patients with large (>10 mm), nonaneurysmal saphenous veins, thermal ablation with EVLA or RFA should be performed over nonthermal techniques.\n\nConsensus statement\n\nRationale\n\nWhile there are many techniques to perform venous ablation and they provide favorable outcomes in the setting of large diameter (>10 mm) veins, thermal ablations have superiority over other treatments.\n\nEvidence\n\nHamann et al examined the safety and effectiveness of endovenous thermal ablation in 11 limbs with a large GSV, but < 2 cm in size close to the junction ( Table XIV ). 158 No DVT or EHIT was noted, and truncal obliteration was 80% at 1 year. Atasoy reviewed 44 consecutive patients with large GSVs, with a mean diameter of 16.95 mm (range, 15-26 mm) and found a 100% occlusion rate at 1 year after treatment. All patients had clinical improvement and improved QOL scores. 159 Calcagno et al 160 found no difference in occlusion rates of 246 limbs with saphenous vein diameter ≤12 mm diameter (mean, 8 ± 2 mm) and of 96 with vein >12 mm (mean, 17 ± 4 mm) when treated with RFA. Fernandez et al treated 183 patients with a GSV diameter <12 mm and 74 with a GSV diameter ≥12 mm. There was significant improvement in pain and QOL in both groups, with no difference in occlusion rates or adverse effects at 1, 6, and 12 months. 161 Borsuk and Fokin conducted a prospective study of 261 EVLA procedures of the GSV with a 1470-nm radial tip laser. Mean diameter of GSV at the SFJ was 24 ± 6 mm (range, 21-43 mm). 162 88% of veins were occluded on day 1; of the 31 nonoccluded veins, 21 of the 31 were occluded by day 7. Ochoa Chaar et al 163 reviewed 732 laser ablations, 88 were performed on veins measuring >10 mm in diameter. Complication and closure rates were similar for larger and smaller veins, unsuccessful closure was more likely in the SSV and anterior accessory saphenous vein (AASV) than in the GSV. 163 In a small case series, Florescu et al 164 performed 20 ablations of veins >10 mm and 4 ablations on veins ≥20 mm in diameter; successful ablation was achieved in 100%. In a retrospective study, 129 patients with a GSV ≥14 mm underwent either stripping or RFA. 165 A composite endpoint of pain, subcutaneous hemorrhage, and paresthesia; the technical outcome at 1 year was evaluated. There were favorable outcomes in 30.8% of the stripping group vs 95.3% in the RFA group. 165 Postoperative pain was associated with increased BMI and large vein diameter. For large diameter veins, RFA was superior to stripping. These data support that thermal ablation techniques are safe and effective in treating large diameter saphenous veins. There have been no large case series using nonthermal techniques in large veins.\n\n5.2.8. The incidence of superficial thrombophlebitis has been reported to be similar for thermal and nonthermal ablations.\n\nConsensus statement\n\nRationale\n\nDifferent rates of postprocedure thrombophlebitis were reported for different ablation techniques, but most RCTs and meta-analyses found no significant difference in the rates of thrombophlebitis as a minor complication after endovenous ablations. 166\n\nEvidence\n\nIn one of the largest single center retrospective trials of 808 patients, Aurshina et al 167 compared acute thrombotic complications after EVLA with RFA. The incidence of acute superficial thrombosis in varicose veins in the ipsilateral leg was 4.6%, and overall thrombotic complications occurred in 10.5%, more frequent after EVLA than after RFA (11.4% vs 7.7%; P = .007). Thrombotic complications in this study, however, also included EHIT. There was no difference in thrombophlebitis following EVLA and RFA in a systematic review of 12 studies that included 1577 patients (RR, 1.03; 95% CI, ; 95% CI,0.56 to 1.92). 166\n\nWhen comparing nonthermal and thermal techniques, a systematic review and meta-analysis by Hassanin et al 21 found no significant difference in phlebitis rates between groups (pooled RR, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.32-1.54). Nonthermal ablations in this study included mechanochemical ablation and cyanoacrylate vein ablations. A meta-analysis from Chen et al 22 found similar results, with no difference in phlebitis rates between cyanoacrylate ablations vs RFA (OR, 51.22; 95% CI, 0.70-2.13; P = .479). Single center studies published on higher rate of mild phlebitis after cyanoacrylate ablation, likely also due to a periphlebitic allergic reaction to cyanoacrylate, 168 while other scoping and systematic reviews and meta-analyses showed lower phlebitis rates after cyanoacrylate treatment of truncal veins vs thermal ablations. 23 , 24 , 169 There was a large heterogeneity in these trials and patients represented encompassed the entire spectrum of CVD (CEAP Class 2-6).\n\nThere was no difference in phlebitis rates, when mechanochemical ablation was compared with EVLA in the LAMA trial occurring in 7% (5/69) after EVLA compared with 13% (9/69) after MOCA ( P = .262). 170 In a retrospective trial with 979 limbs, Obi et al 171 found, not surprisingly, more asymptomatic phlebitis in patients who underwent RFA plus transilluminated powered phlebectomy as compared with RFA alone. Combined therapy of endovenous thermal ablation with polidocanol endovenous microfoam (PEM) sclerotherapy also had higher incidence of phlebitis than thermal ablation combined with placebo sclerotherapy (18/79 vs 0/30). 172\n\n5.2.9. In patients with uncomplicated C2 disease (no venous claudication, thigh swelling, or suprapubic or abdominal wall varicosities) due to concurrent superficial incompetence and iliac or iliofemoral venous obstruction, treatment of superficial incompetence first is indicated.\n\nConsensus statement\n\nFor Rationale and Evidence, please see Table XV . and Consensus Statements 1.5.3 and 1.5.4.\n\n6. Interventions to preserve the GSV\n\n6.1.1. For patients with early stages of symptomatic varicose veins we suggest preserving the GSV using the ambulatory selective variceal ablation under local anesthesia (ASVAL) technique, if performed by a physician who is familiar with the strategy.\n\nGUIDELINE. Grade of recommendation 2 (weak), Quality of Evidence B (moderate)\n\nRationale and evidence\n\nThe ASVAL is a GSV-sparing method that involves detailed DUS mapping of all varicose tributaries connecting to the GSV and ambulatory phlebectomy. 173 , 174 The operation is based on the ascending theory which is that the venous disease process develops in tributaries and distal truncal veins and “ascends” to the junction and the deep venous system. 175 A systematic review of the ASVAL procedure in 2021 included two RCTs, one case-control and three cohort studies, and five case series ( Table XVI ). Varicose vein recurrence at 1 year ranged from 0.55% to 13.5%, and GSV incompetence resolved in 50% to 85% at 1 year after the intervention. 31 Another study reported absence of GSV reflux at 1 year in 98% of limbs with competent SFJ at presentation and in 42% of those with an incompetent SFJ at presentation. 177 Although the level of evidence was low in the systematic review, ambulatory phlebectomy of varicose tributaries creating a venous reservoir may have a positive effect on truncal reflux and ASVAL may be an effective minimally invasive treatment of CVD. Best results were seen in those patients who had a competent terminal valve at the SFJ. 177 The level of evidence for ASVAL was upgraded to B (moderate) because of the recently published SAPTAP RCT. 176 In this multicenter, noninferiority RCT single ambulatory phlebectomy (SAP) was performed in 227 patients and RFA with phlebectomy was done in 237 patients, all with truncal reflux and varicose veins. At 1 year, VEINES-QOL/Sym scores were noninferior after SAP compared with thermal truncal ablation and SAP was a cost-effective alternative to thermal truncal ablation. Twenty-six percent of the SAP patients underwent additional truncal ablation. 176\n\n6.1.2. For patients with symptomatic varicose veins, we suggest preserving the GSV using the ambulatory conservative hemodynamic correction of venous insufficiency (CHIVA) technique, if performed by a physician who is familiar with the strategy.\n\nGUIDELINE. Grade of recommendation 2 (weak), Quality of Evidence B (moderate)\n\nRationale\n\nThe Ambulatory CHIVA was designed to approach venous hemodynamic insufficiency while preserving the GSV, lower transmural pressure in the superficial venous system and avoid removal of varicose tributaries. 178 The goal of CHIVA is to correct the abnormal hemodynamic pathways that are identified with detailed preoperative mapping using DUS. Three types of “shunts” are identified during DUS. Truncal veins are ligated selectively, at the “escape points,” where the reflux starts, and the “reentry points', the perforators, where blood enters from the superficial into the deep system, are preserved. Phlebectomies are not performed and reduction of the venous pressure reduces the size of varicose veins a few months after the operation. 178\n\nEvidence\n\nTwo systematic reviews by Bellmutt-Montoya et al 27 , 28 studied the CHIVA procedure, comparing them to HL&S and to endovenous procedures ( Table XVII ). The last review in 2021 28 included six RCTs and 1160 patients, three RCTs compared CHIVA to HL&S, one to compression treatment of venous ulcers, one to HL&S and RFA and another to HL&S and EVLA. Five studies reported recurrence of varicose veins at 18 months to 10 years. The review concluded that CHIVA may make little or no difference to the recurrence of varicose veins compared with stripping (RR, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.46-1.20), and it may make little or no difference in preventing recurrence compared with RFA (RR, 2.02; 95% CI, 0.74-5.53) or to EVLA (RR, 0.20; 95% CI, 0.01-4.06). Side effects were similar, but CHIVA may reduce slightly nerve injury compared with HL&S and may cause more bruising than RFA. Evidence supporting all results in this Cochrane review were of low certainty, based on a small number of trials with high risk of bias, with imprecise results due to the small number of events.\n\nA retrospective study by Maeso et al, reported better clinical results after CHIVA than after HL&S at 3 years. 179 In a subsequent prospective study by the same group, 58 patients underwent the CHIVA procedure, with ligation of the GSV tributary that connected to a re-entry perforator. The ligation eliminated SFJ reflux in all but 5 patients (8%). Saphenous reflux, however, returned in 88% of the limbs by 6 months and 46 patients required a second operation to ligate and divide the proximal GSV. Elimination of the reflux in the GSV after the interruption of the insufficient collaterals was temporary. 181\n\nA recent RCT by Gonzalez Canas et al 180 analyzed results of RFA, HL& S and CHIVA in 214 limbs. Clinical recurrence rates at 24 months were 4.3%, 7.2%, and 14.7% for HL&S, RFA and CHIVA, respectively. Ultrasound recurrences were 7.1% for HL&S, 13% for RFA, and 46.7% for CHIVA. With an 80% power to assess noninferiority, the study found RFA to be noninferior to CHIVA in terms of clinical recurrence. Considering the steep learning curve of the drained and nondrained strategies, the different types of venous-venous shunts, the need for staged procedures 175 , 182 , 183 , 184 and that all patients require an individualized strategy, it is clear that CHIVA should only be performed by well qualified surgeons who are dedicated experts in venous hemodynamics and DUS. 185\n\n7. Treatment of venous tributaries\n\n7.1. Telangiectasias (spider veins) and reticular veins\n\n7.1.1. For patients with symptomatic telangiectasias and reticular veins we recommend sclerotherapy with liquid or foam.\n\nGUIDELINE. Grade of recommendation 1 (strong), Quality of Evidence B (moderate)\n\nRationale\n\nSclerotherapy has been used for decades for treatment of telangiectasias or spider veins (subdermal veins <1 mm in size) and reticular veins (veins <3 mm in size), with good results. FS has been preferred recently for larger reticular veins.\n\nEvidence\n\nIn a recent Cochrane systematic review and meta-analysis 3632 patients from 35 RCTs were studied. 186 Treatments of telangiectasias and reticular veins included sclerosing agents, laser and compression. There was moderate-certainty evidence that sclerotherapy was better than placebo (SMD, 3.08; 95% CI, 2.68-3.48), but it resulted in more hyperpigmentation, matting and pain. Polidocanol had results similar to other sclerosing agents, but it was less painful. Sodium tetradecyl sulphate sclerotherapy resulted in resolution or improvement of telangiectasias similar to other agents but there was more hyperpigmentation, matting and probably more pain. Foam likely caused more matting than liquid sclerosing agents.\n\n7.1.2 For patients with symptomatic telangiectasias or reticular veins we suggest transcutaneous laser treatment if the patient has sclerosant allergy, needle phobia, sclerotherapy failure or small veins (<1 mm) with telangiectatic matting.\n\nGUIDELINE. Grade of recommendation 2 (weak), Quality of Evidence B (moderate)\n\nRationale and evidence\n\nSurface lasers used to treat telangiectasias have wavelength between 532 nm and 1064 nm. 187 The Nd:YAG 1064 nm laser has shown results close to sclerotherapy but more pain was reported after laser treatment. 188 Parlar et al 188 recommended laser for those who have needle phobia, allergy to sclerosants and for small veins with telangiectatic matting, while sclerotherapy is more effective for larger, feeder veins. A 2021 Cochrane review 186 found no clear difference in resolution or improvement of telangiectasias or matting when laser was compared with sclerotherapy. There was maybe less hyperpigmentation (RR, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.40-0.80) in the laser group. There was more resolution or improvement of telangiectasias in the combined laser and polidocanol group compared with polidocanol alone (low-certainty evidence). Laser treatment may result in less hyperpigmentation (moderate-certainty evidence). Further well-designed studies are required to provide evidence for other available treatments and important outcomes (such as recurrence, time to resolution and delayed adverse events); and to improve our confidence in the identified comparisons.\n\n7.2. Varicose tributaries\n\n7.2.1. For treatment of symptomatic varicose tributaries, we recommend miniphlebectomy or ultrasound guided sclerotherapy using physician-compounded foam (PCF) or polidocanol endovenous microfoam (PEM).\n\nGUIDELINE. Grade of recommendation 1 (strong), Quality of Evidence B (moderate)\n\nFor Rationale and Evidence supporting Guideline 7.2.1., please see Part I of the varicose vein guidelines. 8\n\n7.2.2. For treatment of symptomatic varicose tributaries, we suggest transilluminated powered phlebectomy as an alternative treatment for patients with large clusters of varicosities by a physician who is trained in the procedure.\n\nGUIDELINE. Grade of recommendation 2 (weak), Quality of Evidence C (low to very low)\n\nRationale\n\nIn patients with large, clustered patterns of varicose veins, transilluminated powered phlebectomy remains an acceptable alternative treatment option which requires fewer incisions and shorter treatment times.\n\nEvidence\n\nSeveral studies have described the safety and efficacy of ambulatory phlebectomy. 171 , 189 , 190 Transilluminated powered phlebectomy is a minimally invasive alternative treatment for varicose veins, it is performed under general or local tumescent anesthesia, combined with irrigated illumination and endoscopic-powered venous resection. 191 Two RCTs concluded that powered phlebectomy procedures are quicker and require fewer incisions than traditional phlebectomy, but a steep learning curve is expected. 192 , 193 Chetter et al 193 found, however that compared with ambulatory phlebectomy, ecchymosis (39% vs 25%; P < .001) and pain were more frequent with powered phlebectomy and reduced the early postoperative QOL. A meta-analysis of Luebke and Brunkwall concluded that powered phlebectomy decreased the number of incisions, improved mean cosmetic score and shortened the duration of the procedure in patients with extensive varicosities. There was less calf hematoma after hook phlebectomy and a worse mean pain score after powered phlebectomy. 11\n\n7.2.3. For patients with symptomatic varicose tributaries, treatment of the tributaries should be performed even if the superficial trunks are competent.\n\nConsensus statement\n\nRationale\n\nIn general, treatment for primary or recurrent varicose veins irrespective of axial competence has been shown to be effective and indicated for patients with symptomatic C2 disease.\n\nEvidence\n\nSurgical intervention for symptomatic varicose veins has been widely accepted as being an effective, appropriate therapy with good outcomes for pain reduction and improvement in QOL. A Cochrane review in 2004 compared treatments of varicose veins with surgery vs sclerotherapy and concluded that there was insufficient evidence to preferentially recommend the use of sclerotherapy or surgery. 194 A systematic review in 2009 by Leopardi et al 195 concluded that sclerotherapy and phlebectomy may be appropriate in patients with minor superficial varicose veins not related to reflux of the saphenous system or as a post- or adjunctive treatment of varicose tributaries, but data were limited. A recent Cochrane review in 2021 addressed the efficacy of sclerotherapy alone for treatment of varicose veins. 196 The study included 28 RCTs involving 4278 participants. None of the RCTs compared sclerotherapy, however, to no intervention or to pharmacological therapy. There was very low to low-certainty evidence that FS alone improved cosmetic appearance, residual varicose veins and symptoms compared with placebo and possible improved QOL and VCSS. The study concluded that there is a need for high-quality trials using standardized sclerosant doses, with well-defined outcome measures and measurement time points to increase the certainty of the evidence. There have been a number of studies that showed benefit of treatment of recurrent varicosities after saphenous ablation using either miniphlebectomy or sclerotherapy, with good results. 197 , 198 Currently, UGFS is most commonly used for treatment of recurrent varicose veins, 198 and re-exploration of the groin or phlebectomy in that region is avoided. In the absence of superficial refluxing axial veins or for patients with prior axial reflux ablation, conservative measures, such as compression or VADs can also be considered for varicose tributaries (see Guidelines 2 and 3).\n\n7.2.4. There is no clinical evidence that FS using room air is less safe and effective than using CO 2 gas mixture.\n\nConsensus statement\n\nRationale\n\nMany studies show the benefit of FS for treatment of superficial venous disease, with minimal side effects. While in theory felt to be safer, there is limited data that directly compares the use of CO 2 or CO 2 /O 2 -based foam to room air when treating with foam sclerosants.\n\nEvidence\n\nUGFS has been shown to be safe and effective for the treatment of superficial venous disease, and it is currently recommended for treatment of reticular and varicose veins, in addition of superficial truncal veins. In a comprehensive review of the literature Cartee et al, 199 discussed factors affecting foam stability and found that the half-life of room air foam was reported to be three times longer than that of CO 2 alone and 1.5 times longer than O 2 /CO 2 . 200 , 201\n\nMorrison et al 202 showed that bubbles were detected in the right heart in all patients after room air FS and high-intensity transient signals were seen in the middle cerebral artery in 4 of 21 patients. Morrison et al 203 looked at side effects using air and CO 2 foam for endovenous chemical ablation and found visual disturbances (VDs) were experienced by 3.1% (4/128) and 8.2% (4/49) patients in the CO 2 and room air groups respectively ( P = .15). Respiratory difficulties or circumoral paresthesia each occurred in 0.8% (n = 1) of the CO 2 patients. Incidence of chest tightness (3.1% vs 18%), dry cough (1.6% vs 16%), or dizziness (3.1% vs 12%) were significantly lower in the CO 2 vs room air group ( P < .02). While other complications were less in the CO 2 group, VDs were not significantly different, but conclusion are limited by the small sample size.\n\nWillenburg et al 204 conducted a systemic review evaluating VD following sclerotherapy of varicose veins, reticular veins and telangiectasias. While the prevalence of VD was difficult to determine, two RCTs reported no VDs (95 and 75 patients treated, respectively). In large case series (>500 patients), the prevalence of VD ranged from 0.09% to 2%. In a meta-analysis that included over 9000 patients, Jia et al 10 found the median rates of VDs and headache were 1.4% and 4.2%, respectively. Chest tightness and coughing occurred in <1%. Room air and CO 2 -created foams were included in this metanalysis. Gillet et al 205 evaluated the side-effects and complications of FS in a prospective, multicenter study of room air vs oxygen FS in 1025 patients. The incidence of migraine was 0.78% (with aura 0.59%, 0.19% without aura), VD 0.68%, chest tightness 0.68%, chest tightness with VD 0.49% and transient ischemic attack occurred in 0.1%.\n\nIn summary, while theoretically CO 2 foam supposed to improve safety profile compared with room air, the data is limited, and the studies support both methods of FS ( Table XVIII ). In addition, room air foam is more stable than CO 2 making both the delivery method and provider skill important in achieving the desired outcome.\n\n7.2.5. There is currently no clinical study of sclerotherapy with PCF, prepared using the Tessari method, that shows that it is less safe or effective than PEM.\n\nConsensus statement\n\nRationale\n\nPEM, used for treatment of truncal veins and varicose tributaries is a promising product that appears to be more stable and cohesive, with a narrow bubble size distribution compared with physician compounded foam, used for sclerotherapy of varicose tributaries and superficial truncal veins.\n\nEvidence\n\nAs articulated in the statement, there is no clinical evidence that sclerotherapy with PCF, prepared using the Tessari method is less safe or effective than PEM. There are no prospective studies comparing the two techniques since the VANISH-2 RCT compared 0.5% and 1% PEM with placebo ( Table XIX ). 206 In laboratory testing, PEM had a narrow bubble size distribution, better stability, more cohesive properties and lower degradation rate than any PCFs. 213 Prospective randomized studies comparing PEM with PCF in patients with varicose veins are warranted.\n\n8. Treatment of varicose tributaries concomitant or staged with superficial truncal ablation\n\n8.1.1. For patients with symptomatic reflux in the GSV or SSV and associated varicosities, we recommend ablation of the refluxing venous trunk and concomitant phlebectomy or UGFS of the varicosities with PCF or PEM.\n\nGUIDELINE: Grade of recommendation: 1 (strong), Quality of Evidence: C (low to very low)\n\n8.1.2. For patients with symptomatic reflux in the AAGSV or PAGSV, we suggest ablation of the refluxing venous trunk and concomitant phlebectomy or UGFS of the varicosities with PCF or PEM.\n\nGUIDELINE: Grade of recommendation: 2 (weak), Quality of Evidence: C (low to very low)\n\n8.1.3. For patients with symptomatic reflux in the GSV or SSV, we suggest ablation of the refluxing venous trunk and staged phlebectomy or UGFS of the varicosities only if anatomical or medical reasons are present. We suggest shared decision-making with the patient regarding timing of the procedure.\n\nGUIDELINE: Grade of recommendation: 2 (weak), Quality of Evidence: C (low to very low)\n\n8.1.4. For patients with symptomatic reflux in the AAGSV or PAGSV, we suggest ablation of the refluxing venous trunk and staged phlebectomy or UGFS of the varicosities only if anatomical or medical reasons present. We suggest shared decision-making with the patient regarding timing of the procedure.\n\nGUIDELINE: Grade of recommendation: 2 (weak), Quality of Evidence: C (low to very low)\n\n8.2. For patients with symptomatic reflux in the major superficial venous trunks and associated varicosities undergoing initial ablation alone, we recommend follow-up for ≥3 months to assess the need for staged phlebectomy or ultrasound-guided sclerotherapy for persistent or recurrent symptoms. Longer follow-up is recommended for those with recurrence or more advanced CEAP class.\n\nGood clinical practice statement\n\nFor Rationale and Evidence supporting Guidelines 8.1.1. to 8.1.4. and Good Clinical Practice statement 6.2, please see Part I of the varicose vein guidelines. 8 The panel strongly recommended concomitant procedures to treat truncal incompetence and varicose veins at the same settings, since most patients would like to have a single operation, but the evidence supporting the efficacy of a concomitant procedure had to be downgraded to C (low to very low), because the meta-analysis by Aherne et al 214 included 12 nonrandomized studies with the intrinsic associated bias. A subanalysis of three RCTs showed no difference in reinterventions between the groups. In addition, 63.9% of the patients with planned staged intervention never had a second procedure. The study counted the second operation of a staged procedure “re-interventions” and the percent of reinterventions after the staged procedures was not investigated. In one of the RCTs, 152 the need for staged treatment of varicose tributaries was only 17% in those patients who underwent extended EVLA for axial, below-knee saphenous incompetence.\n\n9. Management of recurrent varicosities\n\n9.1.1. For patients with symptomatic recurrent varicosities, clinical evaluation and DUS should be performed before treatment to determine the potential source of recurrence.\n\nConsensus statement\n\nRationale\n\nMandatory follow-up for C2 patients for several years post intervention is costly and not indicated. Patients who present with recurrent symptoms are common, however, and require thorough evaluation to determine the source of recurrence.\n\nEvidence\n\nEvaluation of symptomatic recurrent varicose veins should be performed after a careful clinical examination of the patient in the standing position and with DUS to assess the etiology, source, type, and extent of recurrent varicose veins. The entire ablated vein, sites of reflux at the SFJ or SPJ and at sites of potential incompetent perforating veins should be investigated. DUS can identify refluxing, recanalized axial veins, and residual saphenous stumps but it only has a sensitivity of 62% and a positive predictive value of only 26% to correctly identify neovascularization. 215\n\nRecurrent varicose veins after surgery have been reported to occur between 6.6% to 37.0% at 2 years and upwards of 50% at 5 years. 7 We recommend that all patients who have undergone a venous intervention for varicose veins have at least one follow-up visit when symptoms related to the procedure are likely to have resolved and interval healing has occurred. Any residual symptoms or problematic residual varicose veins should be reassessed and documented. Reevaluation after 3 months may be patient initiated based on recurrent symptoms.\n\n9.1.2 For patients with symptomatic recurrent varicosities due to persistent or recurrent reflux of the GSV or AAGSV, treatment either with open surgical or endovascular techniques may be performed, with good outcomes expected.\n\nConsensus statement\n\nRationale and evidence\n\nTheivacumar et al treated 64 patients with EVLA of the above knee (above-knee) GSV. Above-knee-GSV EVLA improved symptoms regardless of persisting below-knee reflux; the latter, however, was responsible for residual symptoms and a greater need for sclerotherapy for residual varicosities. 153 A systematic review in 2021 investigated the incidence of below-knee residual reflux in patients who underwent ablation of the GSV. 33 HL&S in the above-knee GSV (6 studies, 525 limbs), as well as EVLA, above-knee only (7 studies, 696 limbs) and above-knee+below-knee ablation (2 studies, 147 limbs), were included. The authors found that above-knee+below-knee EVLA was associated with significantly lower odds of below-knee reflux recurrence compared with above-knee-EVLA alone (OR, 0.1857; 95% CI, 0.076-0.4734; P < .0001). No statistically significant difference was observed in below-knee-GSV reflux recurrence between patients receiving above-knee-EVLA and those receiving above-knee-HL&S.\n\nEndovenous treatment of below-knee refluxing segments of GSV was investigated in a 2018 retrospective study of 37 limbs using RFA and EVLA. 216 Complete closures were found in 35/37 limbs and VCSS was reduced in both groups. Ecchymosis scores were significantly lower after RFA vs EVLA with a 980 nm system, but no difference was reported when compared with a group where a 1470 nm fiber was used. Gifford et al also reported good outcomes with few complications in a retrospective series of below-knee-GSV ablation mainly with EVLA (77 limbs) with only about half of the cohort including patients with C1 to C3 classification and concomitant ambulatory phlebectomies being performed in 75% of cases. 151\n\nCatheter-directed FS has also been investigated as a treatment modality for recurrent GSV reflux in a small prospective analysis of 21 patients in Brazil with mostly C2 disease. 216 FS was performed as a pull-back procedure developed by Parsi with either 3% sodium tetradecyl sulfate or polidocanol 3%, using ultrasound guided tumescent anesthesia. Closure rate was 100% up to six months and 86% at one year. There were no complications.\n\nBradbury et al studied 1252 legs with C2 to C6 disease. 218 They were treated with UGFS. There were 868 C2 and C3 patients. The authors found that out of 1031 patients initially treated for GSV reflux, only 11.8% required a second UGFS for recurrent reflux. Of the 139 patients with AAGSV reflux, 10.1% required a second UGFS for recurrent reflux. Of the 239 patients with SSV reflux, 10.5% required retreatment for axial vein reflux. New reflux rates found in follow-up included 3.4% GSV, 6.5% AASV, and 3.4% SSV.\n\nHernando et al 217 treated 21 patients 16 with C2 disease, for recurrent symptomatic varicose veins. Previous interventions included CHIVA, mechanochemical ablation, thermal ablation, and cyanoacrylate closure. The patients were treated with catheter directed foam for the refluxing axial veins, and phlebectomy for the varicose tributaries. Catheter-directed sclerotherapy was performed in 18 GSVs. Closure at 1 week and at 6 months was 100%, and at1 year it was 86%.\n\nTurtulici et al 222 studied 37 patients with recurrent varicose veins. Ten patients had reflux in the SFJ, 21 had single or multiple recanalized and refluxing perforator veins, and 6 had a combination of SFJ reflux and perforator vein reflux. All patients were treated with RFA. Recanalized axial veins were found in 4%, but no retreatment was required. The vein diameters were small and the Aberdeen Varicose Vein Severity scores of the limbs decreased.\n\n9.1.3. For patients with symptomatic recurrent varicosities due to persistent or recurrent reflux at the groin, either EVLA or RFA can be used if there is a straight GSV stump, long enough for thermal ablation. Sclerotherapy or phlebectomy should be performed for recurrence due to neovascularization.\n\nConsensus statement\n\nRationale\n\nGroin recurrence can be due to recanalized or enlarged remnants of the GSV or tributaries due to neovascularization or disease progression from other vein segments.\n\nEvidence\n\nThe Edinburgh group 220 has classified recurrence into the following subtypes: residual GSV (type 1A), residual tributaries that have enlarged (1B), or neovascularization (1C). The disease from new segments, type 2 is subdivided into cross-groin connections (2A) and thigh perforators (2B). Recurrent veins are often difficult to classify 221 and difficult to treat and there is no preferred mode of treatment. Options include surgical removal, sclerotherapy, and thermal ablation. All modalities have their challenges, including easy tearing and bleeding in the presence of scarring from previous open procedures. UGFS is used with increasing frequency instead of open surgery. EVLA can be performed if there is a straight stump but it can also be challenging in patients with tortuous or short GSV stumps.\n\n9.1.4. For patients with symptomatic recurrent varicosity due to persistent or recurrent reflux of the SSV, UGFS should be performed.\n\nConsensus statement\n\nRationale and evidence\n\nSSV recurrence is rare but can occur following incomplete obliteration distal to the SPJ and in patients with persisting reflux in tributaries associated with the saphenous stump. Recurrence can also occur if there is neovascularization that reconnects the popliteal vein to the superficial network or if there are other sources of proximal reflux connecting to the SSV, not treated initially ( Table XX ). Currently UGFS appears to be the preferred treatment. 221\n\n9.1.5. For patients with residual or recurrent varicosity due to incompetent perforator veins (IPVs), treatment with both open and endovascular techniques may be used depending on the physician's experience, patient wishes, and availability of technology.\n\nConsensus statement\n\nRationale\n\nThere are no high-level data to compare outcome of different techniques to treat IPVs responsible for recurrent/persistent varicose veins. One should rely on experience, patient wishes, and the availability of the various techniques reviewed above.\n\nEvidence\n\nA 2016 prospective trial with 296 IPV closures on 112 patients compared three methods of IPV closure (RFA, EVLA, and FS) in mostly C5 and C6 patients. 223 Closure success was significantly better with RFA (73%; P = .05) vs FS (57%) but failed to reach significance vs EVLA (61%; P = .09). Interestingly, when patients failed FS and were subsequently treated with thermal ablation, RFA success improved to 89% ( P = .003) and EVLA success improved to 85% ( P = .03). The authors concluded that RFA was found to be the most reliable means of IPV closure. After failed FS attempts, IPV closure was enhanced when thermal ablation was used as a secondary technique. A common factor leading to increased failure in all groups was morbid obesity. Although C2 to C6 patients were enrolled in this study, only three with C2 disease were included and all three were treated with foam initially, thereby significantly limiting the applicability of the findings to C2 disease. More recently, a technique for cyanoacrylate closure of perforating veins has been described in a retrospective series of 83 patients with C2-6 disease (27% C2 patients) showing a success rate of 86.5% at 72 days with complications of mainly superficial phlebitis in about 16% of treated veins recorded within 4 weeks. 224 For further evidence on efficacy of IPV ablation, see Guideline 10.\n\n10. Ablation of incompetent perforating veins\n\n10.1.1. For patients with varicose veins (CEAP class C2) who have significant, symptomatic axial reflux of the GSV or SSV, we recommend against treatment of incompetent perforating veins concomitant with initial ablation of the saphenous veins.\n\nGUIDELINE: Grade of recommendation: 1 (strong), Quality of Evidence: C (low to very low)\n\n10.1.2. For patients with varicose veins (CEAP class C2) who have significant, symptomatic axial reflux of the AAGSV or PAGSV, we suggest against treatment of incompetent perforating veins concomitant with initial ablation of the superficial truncal veins.\n\nGUIDELINE: Grade of recommendation: 2 (weak), Quality of Evidence: C (low to very low)\n\nFor Rationale and Evidence supporting Guidelines 10.1.1 and 10.1.2, please see Part I of the varicose vein guidelines. 8\n\n10.2. For patients with incompetent pathologic perforators associated with symptomatic residual, recurrent, and rarely primary varicosities, without associated saphenous incompetence, either open or endovascular techniques can be used to treat the perforator veins.\n\nConsensus statement\n\nRationale\n\nSince IPVs are potential sources of recurrence, occlusion of relevant IPVs is indicated in C2 patients who have symptomatic recurrent or residual varicose veins after previous superficial truncal ablation and tributary treatment. Perforating veins may also rarely be source of primary varicose veins in the absence of saphenous incompetence.\n\nEvidence\n\nVarious techniques have been used to treatment of IPV, from the Linton procedure to subfascial endoscopic perforator surgery (SEPS) and to less invasive techniques of ligation through mini phlebectomy and endovenous procedures. 225 The Linton and the SEPS procedures today are of historic interest only, but SEPS was useful to gain insight into the efficacy of occlusion of IPVs. 226 In an RCT by Kianifard et al, 227 72 patients with C2 disease were treated with HL&S ± phlebectomy, 38 also underwent the SEPS procedure. At 1 year, no additional clinical benefit could be observed, when SEPS was added to HL&S. It should therefore be emphasized that SEPS or any other technique for perforator treatment concomitant with initial superficial axial reflux treatment in C2 disease is not recommended. 8\n\nDespite these general findings, perforating veins may occasionally be the source of primary varicose veins in the absence of saphenous reflux. In a review of 835 limbs referred to the vascular laboratory for CVD, isolated nonsaphenous origin reflux was found in 84 (10%). 228 Ninety percent of these limbs were CEAP class 1 t 3. Thigh perforators were found in 36 limbs (43%, although only 53% of these demonstrated reflux) while 8% of limbs had reflux arising from the vein of the popliteal fossa, and 4% from knee or posterior tibial perforators.\n\nFor treatment of recurrent or residual veins due to IPVs, several techniques of IPV occlusion were reported ( Table XXI ). Park et al used EVLA to occlude the saphenous vein that had retrograde flow from an IPV of the thigh in 69 patients. 229 This RCT concluded that direct IPV treatment was not justified since the technical success of the perforator ablation was significantly lower than just closure of the GSV (76.5% vs 100%). The outcomes were not different for either clinical success or complications between the two groups (one with direct IPV treatment, one without). FS for IPVs has also been analyzed in conjunction with GSV ablation in a prospective trial 231 ; at 6 months it showed a closure rate of 75% for IPVs vs a 98% closure of GSV. A prospective trial on 296 IPV closures in 112 patients compared three methods (RFA, EVLA, and FS); most patients had C5 or C6 disease. 223 Closure success was significantly better with RFA (73% P = .05) vs FS (57%), but failed to reach significance vs EVLA (61% P = .09). More recently, a technique for cyanoacrylate closure of perforating veins was described in a retrospective series of 83 patients with C2 to C6 disease (27% C2 patients). IPV closure rates were excellent, 96 % at 16 days and 86% at 72 days. There were no DVTs, but one patient needed antibiotic treatment for septic thrombophlebitis. 224\n\nIn summary, there is little to no randomized data for the perforator treatment of choice for patients with recurrent/persistent C2 disease, with an associated IPV. When treatment of an IPV in a C2 patient is desired, one should rely on experience, patient wishes, and the availability of the various techniques reviewed above.\n\n11. Management of ablation-related thrombus extension (ARTE) and DVT after endovenous ablations\n\n11.1. Postprocedure DUS\n\n11.1.1. In an average-risk patient who is asymptomatic following thermal ablation of the saphenous vein, we recommend against routine early postprocedural DUS to detect ARTE (formerly known as endovenous heat induced thrombosis [EHIT]) or DVT.\n\nGUIDELINE. Grade of recommendation 1 (strong), Quality of Evidence B (moderate)\n\n11.1.2. In an average-risk patients who is asymptomatic following nonthermal ablation of the saphenous vein, routine early postprocedural DUS may be performed to detect ARTE or DVT.\n\nConsensus statement\n\n11.1.3. In a high-risk patient who is asymptomatic following thermal or nonthermal saphenous ablation early DUS to exclude ARTE or DVT should be performed.\n\nConsensus statement\n\n11.1.4. In patients who are symptomatic following thermal or nonthermal ablation, we recommend early DUS to exclude ARTE or DVT.\n\nGUIDELINE. Grade of recommendation 1 (strong), Quality of Evidence A (high)\n\nRationale\n\nBased on early reports of a high incidence of thrombus extension at the SFJ 232 (endothermal heat induced thrombosis [EHIT]) following thermal ablation of the GSV as well as ready access to ultrasound in most venous clinics, screening for EHIT and DVT with early DUS has become a common practice. EHIT is commonly classified as thrombus extension to the AFJ ort SPJ (I), involvement of <50% of the deep venous lumen (II), involvement of >50% of the deep venous lumen (III), or occlusive DVT (IV). 233 As technology has evolved over the last two decades, it has become clear that junctional thrombus extension can occur after nonthermal as well as thermal ablation. Accordingly, we suggest that the term EHIT” be replaced by “ARTE.” ARTE is an all-encompassing term that includes junctional extension associated with any ablation modality including thermal, foam, mechanicochemical, and cyanoacrylate ablation. This includes events previously described as EHIT, postablation superficial thrombus extension, endovenous glue induced thrombosis, and endovenous foam-induced thrombosis. To ensure consistency with previous reports, ARTE should be classified similar to EHIT (I-IV), although it must be acknowledged that the clinical relevance of ARTE I and likely even ARTE II is minimal. In the following discussion, the preferred terminology “ARTE” will be used whenever possible, although the term “EHIT” will still be used for studies specifically reporting this as an outcome.\n\nPrevious guidelines from the AVF and SVS have suggested that venous duplex examination be performed withing 1 week of the index procedure as an ungraded best practice recommendation. 233 The European Society for Vascular Surgery has similarly considered ultrasound surveillance after treatment of a saphenous trunk as a consensus recommendation. 56 However, despite this guidance, most evidence suggests that the incidence of thromboembolic complications after saphenous ablation is low, with the combined incidence of ARTE, DVT, and pulmonary embolism (PE) being 1.3% to 1.7%. 234 , 235 , 236 Given this low incidence, the potential magnitude of effect of any intervention such as routine ultrasound surveillance after venous ablation would be classified as “trivial” to “small” (<5 events per 1000 subjects to 5-20 events per 1000 people) according to criteria developed by a Chest expert panel. 237 No trials randomizing patients to early ultrasound screening vs observation have been performed, and are unlikely to be done, given the large number of patients such a trial would require achieving adequate power in the setting of this low event rate. Assuming a pooled incidence of all venous thromboembolic (VTE) events of 1.5%, a randomized clinical trial evaluating the ability of screening DUS to reduce the incidence to 1% would require approximately 15,500 patients. 238 Furthermore, routine ultrasound screening is not recommended even in populations at higher risk for VTE, including critically ill patients with coronavirus 2019 (ungraded consensus recommendation) 239 ; those undergoing orthopedic surgery (Grade 1B against), 240 nonorthopedic surgery (Grade 2C against) 241 ; and major trauma patients (Grade 2C against). 241 Based on the low incidence of thromboembolic complications in asymptomatic patients, the high cost of routine DUS, the futility of performing randomized trials evaluating the utility of routine DUS, and recommendations against screening in other higher-risk populations, we recommend against routine ultrasound surveillance following saphenous vein ablation in low or average risk patients for thrombotic complications Although evidence in randomized trials of routine ultrasound screening is lacking, the strength of our recommendation is 1 (strong) against screening in this patient population, given the futility of performing such studies.\n\nEvidence\n\nA systematic review of 39 RCTs and 33 observational studies (31,663 patients in total) undergoing routine DUS within 4 weeks of thermal or nonthermal ablation of the GSV, SSV, or accessory veins, found a very low incidence of EHIT (2.9%), DVT (0.26%), and PE (0.03%). 234 Most EHITs were types I and II, with the incidence of EHIT III to IV being only 0.5%. The pooled incidence of any VTE event (EHIT II-IV, DVT, and PE) was 1.32% (95% CI, 0.75%-2.02%) with significant heterogeneity. The cost of routine ultrasound screening was estimated to be $61,292 per EHIT III or IV or DVT prevented.\n\nA second, large systematic review (52 studies, 16,398 patients) evaluated only observational studies or randomized trials including patients undergoing thermal ablation of the GSV and having ultrasound surveillance within 1 month of the procedure. 235 The pooled incidence of EHIT II to IV or DVT was 1.7% (95% CI, 0.9%-2.7%), for EHIT II to– IV 1.4 % (0.8%-2.3%), for DVT 0.3% (0.2%-0.5%), and for PE 0.1% (0.1%-0.02%). Significant heterogeneity was noted for EHIT II to IV + PE and EHIT II to IV, but not for DVT or PE.\n\nA third systematic review including 75 studies (23,265 patients) included both RCTs and case series and found very similar incidences of EHIT II to IV (1.27%; 95% CI, 0.74-1.93%), DVT (0.28%; 95% CI, 0.18-0.4%), and PE (0.11%; 95% CI, 0.06-0.18%). 236 Other systematic reviews have found the majority of DVTs to be confined to the calf veins, with the incidence of proximal DVT varying between 0% and 0.4%. 41\n\nAlthough randomized trials evaluating screening DUS vs no ultrasound in asymptomatic patients after saphenous ablation have not been done, two such trials have been performed in orthopedic patients. 240 These trials failed to demonstrate a benefit to routine postoperative screening, although major bleeding rates were higher in the screening arms.\n\nIn one of the systematic reviews, 234 nonthermal techniques were associated with a higher incidence of DVT than thermal techniques (0.43 vs 0.23%; P = .02), although this difference was due to a higher incidence of DVT in patients undergoing sclerotherapy ( Table XXII ). Although total VTE events were higher among patients undergoing RFA in comparison with EVLA (3.1% vs 2.2%; P < .001), EHIT was higher in patients undergoing EVLA (4.4% vs 3.0%; P < .001). However, a second large metanalysis found the incidence of thrombotic events to be similar for RFA and EVLA. 235\n\nAlthough some data suggests that the incidence of thromboembolic complications has decreased since 2009, 242 older meta-analyses 243 have demonstrated a similarly low incidence of thromboembolic complication after thermal ablation or FS of the GSV. Among studies evaluating the incidence of thromboembolic complications after thermal ablation (12 RCTs, 19 case series) or FS (12 RCTs, 6 case series), the individual incidence of EHIT, DVT, and PE was <1% for all treatment modalities (RFA, laser ablation, FS). Differences between treatment modalities were judged not to be clinically meaningful.\n\nWhile thrombotic complications after isolated endovenous ablation are uncommon, the incidence in patients undergoing open procedures such as HL&S and/or phlebectomy may be as high as 6.25%. 39 , 244 Concomitant phlebectomy of tributaries has been identified as an independent risk factor for VTE development. 242 These patients may not identify VTE symptoms due to pain and swelling associated with phlebectomy and many VTE are asymptomatic. 244 Thus, the role, or lack thereof, of surveillance duplex in this patient population remains to be defined.\n\nWhile we recommend against routine ultrasound screening in asymptomatic, average-risk patients, clinicians should have a low threshold for obtaining such studies in patients with postoperative symptoms suggestive of DVT and should consider such studies in selected high-risk patients. The recommendation for DUS in patients with postprocedure symptoms suggestive of DVT (1A) is based on a meta-analysis performed by the American Society of Hematology in support of their guidelines for evaluation of patients with a high pretest probability of DVT. 245 As discussed below (guideline 11.2.1.), consistently defining the risk factors constituting a “high-risk” patient is more difficult and requires clinical judgment. With respect to ablation technique, some randomized trials 206 , 246 and meta-analyses 234 have suggested a higher thrombotic risk with FS, although such reports are not consistent across studies. 243 The clinical relevance of these ultrasound-detected events in asymptomatic patients is unclear and requires further study. Data from at least one RCT of PEM demonstrated no difference in outcome among patients with ultrasound-detected postprocedural thrombotic events regardless of whether they were treated with anticoagulants or not. 206\n\n11.2. Pharmacological thromboprophylaxis\n\n11.2.1. For high-risk patients undergoing endovenous ablation, we suggest pharmacological thromboprophylaxis.\n\nGUIDELINE: Grade of recommendation: 2 (weak), Quality of Evidence: C (low to very low)\n\nRationale\n\nThis guideline is consistent with that previously suggested by the AVF/SVS. 233 Other guidelines include those from the UK Royal Society of Medicine which suggest preoperative assessment of all patients for both VTE and bleeding risk with pharmacological prophylaxis for 7 to 14 days in intermediate-risk patients and for 4 to 6 weeks in high-risk patients. 247 The European Society for Vascular Surgery recommends VTE risk assessment in all patients with consideration of individualized thromboprophylaxis (Class IIa, Level B). 56\n\nAlthough the weight of the evidence does suggest some benefit to pharmacological thromboprophylaxis, the evidence is difficult to generalize due to the limited magnitude of effect among those systematic reviews reporting a benefit of routine thromboprophylaxis (number needed to treat 25.4-172.4 for the prevention of DVT), lack of risk stratification in most studies, and significant heterogeneity in the results. In addition to the uncertain value of routine thromboprophylaxis, there is little data regarding optimal agents, dose, or duration of thromboprophylaxis if used. We therefore suggest pharmacoprophylaxis in high-risk patients, but with a low certainty of evidence.\n\nEvidence\n\nDespite the very low incidence of thromboembolic events among patients undergoing endovenous ablation, one large systematic review did find a significantly lower incidence of EHIT among those receiving pharmacological prophylaxis (1.63% vs 3.04%; P < .001). 234 However, this was not a uniform finding across individual studies and there was heterogeneity in the prophylactic regimes used. Another systematic review included 8 studies (3 RCTs, 5 cohort studies, 6479 patients) comparing pharmacoprophylaxis to no prophylaxis following a variety of varicose vein procedures. 41 Five studies evaluated prophylaxis after open surgery and three after EVLA. The risk of DVT was lower for endovenous procedures than for open surgery. Prophylaxis was associated with a nonsignificant reduction in the composite risk of DVT, PE, and superficial venous thrombosis (pooled RR, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.04-10.43; P = .74) and of DVT alone (pooled RR, 0.59, 0.08-4.60; P = .61). There was significant heterogeneity in both results. Notably, confining the analysis to randomized trials did show a significant reduction in the risk of DVT (0.22 vs 4.15%: RR, 0.05; 95% CI, 0.02-0.13, P < .00,001). Among the two studies reporting bleeding risk, there was no difference among those receiving or not receiving prophylaxis. Although a few included studies evaluated the efficacy of fondaparinux and rivaroxaban as well as short vs extended courses of prophylaxis, conclusions based on the available data are difficult.\n\nA second broader meta-analysis included 47 randomized trials, 105 prospective cohort studies, 67 retrospective cohort studies, and 2 case control studies including a total of 476, 266 patients undergoing a variety of superficial endovenous interventions with exclusion of open venous surgery. 32 Notably, most studies excluded patients with a history of DVT. Although significant heterogeneity precluded analysis of all study arms, among prospective studies additional pharmacological prophylaxis reduced the incidence of DVT to 0.73% (95% CI, 0.52%-1.02%) from 1.31% (1.15%-1.48%) for mechanical prophylaxis alone (compression stockings/bandages). No significant difference was noted between single-dose and extended pharmacoprophylaxis. There were no significant differences in PE (0.14%, 0.07%-0.28% vs 0.16%, 0.15%-0.18%) or EHIT III to IV (0.35%, 0.09%-1.40% vs 0.88%, 0.28%-2.70%) in comparing pharmacoprophylaxis to mechanical prophylaxis alone. Major bleeding was quite rare (1 case) while minor bleeding was observed in 0% to 10% of patients. Risk of bias was estimated to be high, and the Quality of Evidence was moderate among randomized trials and very low among nonrandomized trials.\n\nA systematic review included in the AVF/SVS EHIT guidelines, which included only retrospective observational studies, failed to show a lower incidence of EHIT with pharmacological thromboprophylaxis. 233\n\n11.2.2. For patients undergoing endovenous ablation routine risk stratification should be performed to assess the need for periprocedural thromboprophylaxis.\n\nConsensus statement\n\nRationale and evidence\n\nThe literature reflects great uncertainty regarding the value of risk assessment in determining the need for thromboprophylaxis in patients undergoing superficial venous interventions. 32 Defining the risk factors for DVT/EHIT after saphenous ablation is unfortunately difficult due to the very low number of events and limited statistical power. Although inconsistent across studies, suggested risk factors for EHIT/DVT have included age, male gender, CEAP class, personal or family history of VTE, known thrombophilia, reduced mobility, obesity, hormone therapy, active cancer, concomitant procedures including sclerotherapy and microphlebectomy, large GSV diameter, and a history of SVT. 41 , 233 , 242 , 247 , 248 Given such uncertainty, deciding who constitutes a high-risk patient requires some degree of clinical judgment at present. Although one single-center study has shown the Caprini risk assessment score to be associated with the development of EHIT (OR, 1.58; 95% CI, 1.24-2.0; P = .0002), only ultrasound identified EHIT I to II were found in this study and it remains unclear whether the Caprini score is predictive of clinically relevant thrombotic events after superficial venous intervention. 248\n\nCurrently, no specific guidelines address the role of VTE risk stratification in the ambulatory surgery setting. Data from patients undergoing both inpatient and outpatient procedures suggests that identification of patient and procedural related risk factors allows for identification of 15- to 20-fold variation in VTE risk. Individualized risk stratification allows for the identification of low-risk patients in whom the risk-benefit ratio is unfavorable, and potentially for the identification of patients at high VTE risk in whom the benefit of receiving chemical chemoprophylaxis outweighs the attendant bleeding risk. A widely accepted risk threshold is a calculated VTE risk of 3%, assuming a two-fold reduction in VTE events compared with expected bleeding events from administration of an anticoagulant. 241 Currently, no VTE risk assessment model (RAM) has been validated in patients undergoing varicose vein procedures.\n\nIndirect evidence suggests that risk stratifying patients undergoing varicose vein procedures may have potential benefits. Namely, among patients undergoing a variety of ambulatory surgical procedures, those undergoing procedures for varicose vein procedures are at the highest risk for development of VTE. 249 Second, variations in VTE rate among patients undergoing venous procedures have been identified according to patient and procedure related characteristics. For instance, patients undergoing open surgery or longer operations are at greater risk at developing VTE. 250 Third, limited evidence suggests that those with a higher composite VTE RAM score, such as that used in the Caprini RAM, have an increased VTE and ARTE risk. 251 Finally, a recent meta-analysis suggested that in patients undergoing inpatient and outpatient surgical procedures (including those undergoing venous procedures) with a Caprini score of ≥7 benefited from chemoprophylaxis in terms of VTE risk reduction without an increase in bleeding. 252 This data highlights the critical need to determine from a specific VTE RAM the threshold at which chemical thromboprophylaxis is favorable for the patient undergoing outpatient axial and/or tributary bed treatment. Future studies should likely focus on clinically relevant venous thromboembolic events (DVT, PE) and should include some measure of risk.\n\n11.3. Treatment of varicose vein procedure related DVT and ARTE\n\nIn patients with DVT after endovenous ablation, we endorsed the recommendations of Stevens et al, Antithrombotic Therapy for VTE Disease: Second Update of the CHEST Guideline and Expert Panel Report. Chest. 2021; 160(6): e545-e608. 253 The evidence base for these guidelines was adopted without review.\n\n11.3.1. For patients with acute isolated distal DVT after varicose vein procedure , without severe symptoms or risk factors for extension we suggest serial imaging of the deep veins for 2 weeks.\n\nGUIDELINE: Grade of recommendation: 2 (weak), Quality of Evidence: B (moderate)\n\n11.3.2. For patients with isolated distal DVT after varicose vein procedure and severe symptoms or risk factors for extension we suggest anticoagulation.\n\nGUIDELINE: Grade of recommendation: 2 (weak), Quality of Evidence: C (low to very low)\n\n11.3.3. For patients with acute proximal DVT after varicose vein procedure , we recommend anticoagulation with a direct oral anticoagulant (over a vitamin K antagonist).\n\nGUIDELINE: Grade of recommendation: 1 (strong), Quality of Evidence: B (moderate)\n\n11.3.4. For patients with symptomatic ARTE after endovenous ablation, we recommend anticoagulation with a direct oral anticoagulant (over a vitamin K antagonist).\n\nGUIDELINE: Grade of recommendation: 1 (strong), Quality of Evidence: C (low to very low)\n\n11.4.1. For patients with asymptomatic ARTE III and IV after endovenous ablation, anticoagulation with a direct oral anticoagulant (over a vitamin K antagonist) should be performed.\n\nConsensus statement\n\n11.4.2. For patients who receive anticoagulation for ARTE following endovenous ablation, treatment should be continued until the thrombus retracts.\n\nConsensus statement\n\nRationale\n\nAs discussed, routine screening of asymptomatic, average-risk patients for ARTE/DVT is not recommended and asymptomatic ARTE/DVT in these patients should rarely be diagnosed. The majority of ARTEs are ARTE I and II, 234 which is of minimal clinical relevance. Although previous guidelines 233 have recommended either no treatment (EHIT I), weekly surveillance (EHIT II), or consideration of antiplatelet vs anticoagulant therapy (high-risk patients with EHIT II), these should be rarely encountered in the absence of routine ultrasound surveillance. ARTE III and IV are presumably more likely to be symptomatic and to be suspected based on accepted clinical indications. Although it is not entirely clear that the natural history of ARTE III to IV is the same as DVT, 233 a conservative approach would suggest treatment similar to established guidelines for DVT treatment. 253 However, as the natural history of ARTE is not well-documented, the value of alternative approaches such as anticoagulation until thrombus resolution as observed by ultrasound cannot be entirely excluded. Given the uncertain benefit, treatment of symptomatic ARTE according to established guidelines for acute DVT is a weak suggestion. Furthermore, as this evidence is extrapolated from current guidelines for the management of DVT and is therefore indirect, for the management of ARTE the level of evidence has been downgraded to C.\n\nFurther research is needed regarding the natural history of ARTE. More data is particularly needed regarding the value of anticoagulation vs serial follow-up and the duration of anticoagulation in treated patients. Given the uncertainty of the evidence, at present, duration of anticoagulation should be at the judgment of the clinician.\n\nEvidence\n\nThe management of symptomatic DVT is generally guided by the Chest guidelines for Antithrombotic Therapy for VTE Disease 253 and the reader is referred to that manuscript for the supporting evidence.\n\nUnfortunately, the data regarding the management of ARTE are substantially less robust. The evidence regarding the treatment of ultrasound detected (most presumably asymptomatic) ARTE is derived from small case series and retrospective studies and is accordingly quite variable. One systematic review evaluated the management of ARTE detected by routine ultrasound screening in 24 studies for which the treatment was described. 236 Among the 25 included studies, anticoagulation was the most common treatment for EHIT, with two studies reporting selective use of antiplatelet therapy and seven studies reporting observation only. Irrespective of treatment, there were no reports of propagation or embolization of EHIT II to IV once identified. The authors concluded that the natural history of EHIT is generally benign ( Table XXIII ).\n\n12. Management of SVT in patients with varicose and nonvaricose veins\n\nGuideline 12. Address the management of SVT in patients who have not recently undergone superficial venous interventions. The management of EHIT and other thrombotic complications of superficial venous interventions were presented in Guidelines 11.\n\n12.1.1. For patients with SVT of the main saphenous trunks and tributaries above the knee >3 cm from the SFJ and ≥5 cm in length, whether or not associated with varicose veins, we recommend fondaparinux 2.5 mg subcutaneously daily for 45 days; alternatively, rivaroxaban 10 mg/d for 45 days may be appropriate for patients unwilling or unable to perform subcutaneous injections.\n\nGUIDELINE. Grade of recommendation: 1 (strong), Quality of Evidence: A (high)\n\n12.1.2. For patients with SVT of the main saphenous trunks ≤3 cm from the SFJ, treatment with full anticoagulation for a minimum of 6 weeks should be continued.\n\nConsensus statement\n\n12.1.3 For patients with SVT of the main saphenous trunks we suggest against using prophylactic or therapeutic dose low-molecular weight heparin (LMWH) and nonsteroid anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). While both have been found to reduce SVT pain and extension, they have failed to prevent VTE. If NSAIDs are used for treatment of short segment distal SVT, surveillance with DUS for VTE extension is recommended due to the high prevalence of concomitant DVT.\n\nGUIDELINE. Grade of recommendation: 1 (strong), Quality of Evidence: A (high)\n\n12.1.4. For selected patients with isolated thrombosis of varicose tributaries or limited involvement of the GSV, we suggest phlebectomy as a safe alternative.\n\nGUIDELINE. Grade of recommendation: 2 (weak), Quality of Evidence: B (moderate)\n\n12.1.5. In patients with saphenous thrombophlebitis, ablation should be performed once the inflammation has resolved if there is evidence of pathologic reflux on DUS.\n\nConsensus statement\n\nRationale\n\nDespite recognition that superficial thrombophlebitis, also known as SVT, is more common than DVT, there is less awareness of its associated morbidity and little consensus on its management. 254 While traditionally thought of as benign, recent studies have highlighted its association with DVT and PE if left untreated. Studies show that SVT may progress to DVT in 6% to 44% of patients; 20% to 33% may have asymptomatic PE; and 2% to 13% may have symptomatic PE. Superficial venous thrombosis involving the saphenous trunk has the greatest association with VTE. 34 Although the majority of SVT occurs in varicose veins, SVT in nonvaricose veins confers greater morbidity and few studies have stratified treatment based on this distinction. 34 Several therapies including surgery, compression stockings, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) aim to reduce pain and inflammation, however, given the associated progression to VTE, anticoagulation is recommended. Of note, the application of warm compresses to the site of SVT has never been evaluated in any study.\n\nEvidence\n\nThese recommendations are supported by two recent systematic reviews 34 , 35 ( Table XXIV ). The 2018 Cochrane review included 33 studies involving 7296 patients with SVT of the legs. 34 Treatments evaluated included fondaparinux, rivaroxaban, LMWH, unfractionated heparin, NSAIDS, compression stockings, and topical, intramuscular, or intravenous treatment as well as surgical thrombectomy or ligation. A minority of studies compared treatment to placebo and most studies were small and of poor quality. Further, most studies excluded patients with SVT that was within 3 cm of the SFJ. The recommendations are primarily based on one large placebo controlled RCT of 3002 participants who received fondaparinux and demonstrated a significant reduction in symptomatic VTE, SVT extension, and SVT recurrence in comparison with placebo. Major bleeding was infrequent in both groups. A second systematic review and meta-analysis included seventeen studies and 6862 patients with SVT and confirmed that fondaparinux achieved the lowest rate of progression to DVT and PE without conclusions about other treatment due to low quality evidence. 35 In the Surprise study, patients with SVT and one or more risk factors for VTE were randomized to 45 days of fondaparinux or rivaroxaban 10 mg. 257 The results suggested that rivaroxaban was as effective as fondaparinux, however, the study was not powered to prove noninferiority. A call for further studies was prompted by the nonsignificant increase in the primary composite outcome as well as by an increase in clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding in the rivaroxaban group. These recommendations are similar to those, published recently on management of SVT in the CHEST guidelines. 253\n\nLow-quality evidence in one study found that prophylactic LMWH reduced extension of SVT (statistically significant), but did not reduce incidence of VTE, while therapeutic LMWH evaluated in one study reduced both SVT extension (statistically significant) and progression to VTE, but improvement was less significant at 3 month follow-up due to a catch-up phenomenon. 34 NSAIDS were also found in one study to reduce SVT extension (statistically significant). 258 However, there were no differences in the resolution of local symptoms and signs of SVT and in the incidence of VTE. While there were no major bleeding episodes recorded in either the NSAID or placebo groups, indomethacin increased the rate of adverse effects. 259 NSAIDs have also been found to increase the risk of gastric pain three-fold compared with placebo. 258 , 259\n\nCompared with elastic stockings alone, one study showed that HL&S plus elastic stockings reduced the risk of SVT extension and recurrence (RR, 0.09; 95% CI, 0.01-0.64) and was associated with a lower, statistically not significant, incidence of VTE (RR, 0.37; 95% CI, 0.08-1.78). 260 However, most studies evaluating surgery and topical treatments did not report SVT progression, VTE, or adverse events. 34\n\nA recent analysis from the RIETE registry of patients with thrombosis involving main trunk of the GSV within 3 cm of the SFJ compared those treated with full dose fondaparinux or LMWH followed by VKA (227 patients) to those (147 patients) who received prophylactic doses of fondaparinux or intermediate dose LMWH. 255 Those receiving full-dose anticoagulation received a longer course of treatment and all patients were followed for 3 months. There was no difference in the incidence of VTE or recurrent SVT between the groups or in the safety outcomes of major bleeding or clinically nonmajor bleeding. The authors concluded that these findings are hypothesis generating and support a trial evaluating the efficacy of preventative dose anticoagulation in comparison with therapeutic anticoagulation for treatment of SVT approaching the SFJ.\n\nThere is a paucity of studies specifically evaluating the management of SVT in patients with varicose veins. In a prospective observational study of 195 limbs with SVT and varicose veins treated with surgery or anticoagulation, there was no difference in the primary composite outcome of SVT extension/recurrence, incidence of DVT or symptomatic PE. 256 The authors concluded that urgent surgery is not associated with reduction in the incidence of VTE compared with anticoagulation alone but could be safely performed in selected patients with isolated thrombosis of varicose tributaries or limited involvement of the saphenous trunk.\n\nA single-center randomized trial of 73 patients compared the use of thigh-high 23 to 32 mm Hg compression stockings to no compression stockings for 3 weeks in patients with isolated SVT of the legs who all received prophylactic dose LMWH with or without NSAIDS. 261 The addition of compression stockings resulted in no significant difference in reduction of pain, consumption of analgesics, thrombus length, skin erythema, d -dimer, or QOL. However, patients wearing compression had significantly faster thrombus regression at 7 days.\n\nThe recurrence rate of SVT is between 10 and 20%. One large case series of SVT patients described a recurrence rate of 15% among 221 patients. 262 In modern times with widespread application of anticoagulant therapies, the risk of recurrence or VTE is ∼6%, with the highest risk occurring among patients with previous episodes of SVT and long segment thrombosis. 263 Although not addressed by a randomized control trial, best practice would include informing patient of the risk of recurrent SVT and offering surgical or endovascular therapy for the treatment of symptomatic recanalized varices and axial reflux (if present in the recanalized saphenous vein after completion of evidence based antithrombotic therapy).\n\n13. Management of bleeding varicose veins\n\n13.1. For patients presenting with acute bleeding from varicose veins, leg elevation, direct compression, and sclerotherapy should be attempted before suture ligation to control bleeding.\n\nConsensus statement\n\n13.2 . For patients with bleeding due to varicose veins, prompt referral to a venous specialist should be done.\n\nConsensus statement\n\n13.3. For patients who presented with bleeding from varicose veins, and bleeding has been controlled, evaluation for superficial venous incompetence and appropriate intervention should be done to control venous hypertension and reduce the risk of recurrent hemorrhage.\n\nConsensus statement\n\n13.4. Patients with varicose veins or venous ulcerations should be counseled on the possibility of venous bleeding and their families, caregivers, or friends educated regarding leg elevation and simple compression techniques to control severe bleeding.\n\nConsensus statement\n\nRationale\n\nThe true incidence of bleeding from varicose veins is unknown due to under-reporting but appears to occur in approximately 4% of patients presenting with varicose veins. 264 , 265 Bleeding often arises from small veins at the ankle with surrounding skin pigmentation and induration or following exacerbation of a venous ulcer leading to erosion of veins underlying the ulcer bed. 266 Patients may report bleeding when the varicosities are exposed to warm water (in the shower or bathing), causing the veins to vasodilate, or bleeding can occur because of minor trauma. Patients with right heart failure or cardiomyopathy may also experience intermittent, often heavy, bleeding from dilated veins. Regardless of the cause, when a varicose vein ruptures, profuse bleeding can occur due to associated venous hypertension.\n\nAlthough most bleeding associated with varicose veins is not associated with hypotension and does not require transfusion, 267 fatal hemorrhage is an uncommon, but not entirely rare event. 266 Most cases of fatal variceal hemorrhage have come from autopsy reports. A 2011 report documented <100 fatalities over several decades. 268 Twenty-three fatalities were reported in England and Wales in 2001. 266 A systematic review including 17 articles found that deaths secondary to bleeding varicose veins accounted for 0.01% of autopsy cases. 269 The victims were patients aged 60 to ≥90 years of age with no gender discrimination. Deaths due to hemorrhage occurred in older persons who lived alone, were mobility impaired, had skin fragility or an ulcer located near the malleolus, were on anticoagulation or antiplatelet medication, or had a comorbidity such as dementia or liver failure. These rare case reports describe pulsatile bleeding both from the thin-wall veins themselves and from exposed veins in a venous ulcer bed leading to hypovolemic shock and death, especially in the presence of ischemic heart disease. 270 Another single-center study found that patients with bleeding episodes had decreased access to basic first aid or hemorrhage control techniques. 264\n\nAs many of the fatal hemorrhagic events can be prevented, it is critical that patients be asked about prior bleeding episodes, be warned about the possibility, and be instructed in first aid and hemorrhage control techniques, such as leg elevation and direct compression on the bleeding varicose veins. The danger of applying venous tourniquets and increasing venous pressure has often been emphasized in the literature. 266\n\nEvidence\n\nBoth because of the infrequency of bleeding events and the difficulty in leaving such patients untreated, no studies comparing intervention to conservative management have been performed. However, very limited evidence does suggest that fatal hemorrhage usually occurs after a previous untreated episode of bleeding 266 and there is general consensus that patients should be treated after the first episode of hemorrhage. 267 , 271 Furthermore, there is evidence from single-center series that superficial venous intervention reduces recurrent hemorrhage. Selection of an appropriate treatment modality is somewhat dependent of the patient's venous anatomy and size of the bleeding vein. Among 5 patients reported in one series, acute control of venous hemorrhage was successfully achieved with direct injection of 1% polidocanol foam into the bleeding varicosity with or without FS (3% polidocanol) of the associated saphenous trunk. No recurrent bleeding was noted after a mean follow-up of 17.4 months. 272 A larger series reported successful acute control of bleeding in 72 patients treated with FS. 271 In comparison with 52 patients treated with simple suture ligation, FS was associated with faster wound healing (7 vs 14 days; P < .001) and a lower risk of recurrent bleeding at 12 months (0% vs 23%, P < .001). Others have similarly reported excellent control of bleeding from smaller veins (<1 mm) with sclerotherapy, while bleeding from larger veins was successfully controlled with high ligation, stripping, and phlebectomy. Recurrent bleeding was noted in only 1 of 14 patients (7%) after a mean follow-up of 21.3 months. 267 Venous ablation has been used more recently in patients with varicosities, with small series (n = 13) demonstrating 85% of patients to be free from recurrent bleeding at a mean follow-up of 2.26 years. 265\n\nAlthough the supportive evidence is quite limited, the literature does suggest that acute bleeding is optimally managed with sclerotherapy, while prevention of recurrence may warrant ablation of any truncal venous incompetence.\n\n14. Management of superficial vein aneurysms\n\n14.1. For patients with superficial truncal vein aneurysm, located within 3 cm of the SFJ or SPJ, open surgical excision, with high proximal and distal ligations should be performed. If symptomatic saphenous reflux is present, endovenous or open surgical ablation (phlebectomy or limited stripping) of the distal saphenous vein should be performed.\n\nConsensus statement\n\n14.2. For patients with an asymptomatic superficial truncal vein aneurysm, located >3 cm distal to the SFJ, endovenous ablation alone should be performed. Thromboprophylaxis in these patients reduces the risk of VTE.\n\nConsensus statement\n\n14.3. Patients with symptomatic, thrombosed or large (>3 cm) aneurysms in the superficial veins are best treated with surgical excision.\n\nRationale\n\nFocal dilation of the saphenous veins (GSV, SSV, AAGSV, or PAGSV) that measures ≥20 mm for GSV and 15 mm for SSV, or has a diameter that is three times the upper limit of the average saphenous diameter is considered an aneurysm. 273 Most patients are asymptomatic or have a palpable lump at the groin or in the popliteal fossa. 274 Many patients present only with symptoms of varicosity or CVI. 158 , 275 , 276 Patients occasionally complain of a tender lump, 277 that can be firm, if the aneurysm is thrombosed. 278 Evaluation with duplex scanning is usually satisfactory, but congenital superficial truncal vein aneurysms may occur in patients with venous malformations (Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome) 279 and saphenous aneurysms may occasionally mimic femoral hernia, 274 synovial, 280 , 281 or Baker cyst 282 or venous leiomyosarcoma. 283 In these patients further evaluation with computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging is warranted. When the saphenous aneurysm is near the femoral or popliteal vein, open surgical excision is indicated, with ligation or oversewing of a dilated proximal saphenous stump. In patients with symptomatic saphenous reflux, endovenous ablation, tumescent anesthesia aided phlebectomy or limited stripping of the distal segment is performed. If the aneurysm is located >3 cm distal to the SFJ or SPJ, permitting safe proximal occlusion with endovenous techniques, endovenous ablation alone is frequently possible and safe, although most large (>3 cm) or symptomatic, thrombosed aneurysms are better treated with surgical excision at any location. There is also significant risk of sural nerve injury, when thermal ablation is used to treat proximal SSV aneurysm. Ablation of saphenous aneurysms within 3 cm. of the SFJ and SPJ should not be treated with UGFS due to the increased risk of propagation of larger amount of foam into the deep venous system.\n\nEvidence\n\nSimilar to deep vein aneurysms, 284 , 285 , 286 there is evidence that saphenous vein aneurysms carry a risk of VTE. 287 , 288 , 289 Treatment is recommended whether or not there is thrombus in the aneurysm sac. Conservative therapy with elastic compression for small aneurysms and in those who are not candidates for intervention decreases the risk of thrombotic complications. Most reports describe open surgical excision of saphenous aneurysms, with proximal and distal ligation or distal saphenous ablation. 274 , 277 , 278 , 287 , 288 , 289 , 290 In two smaller series of mostly small GSV aneurysms (<3 cm in size), located close to the SFJ, endovenous ablation alone was used, without proximal high ligation. 158 , 276\n\nPavlović, et al 276 treated 11 limbs of 8 patients with RFA alone, without high ligation. All GSV aneurysms were located near the SFJ, distal to the preterminal valve. Median aneurysm diameter was 21 mm (interquartile range, 17.2-23.4 mm), all patients had incompetent GSV and CVD. The catheter tip was placed at 1 to 2 cm from the SFJ, within the aneurysmal segment. Extra tumescent anesthetic and compression was used, and the first segment was treated with three cycles using RFA. Thromboprophylaxis was given for 7 days. At a median follow-up of 8 years median saphenous diameter was reduced to 5.8 mm, the aneurysmal segment was either completely or partly obliterated, and, if partly patent, always had an antegrade flow. One patient (9.1%) had EHIT III despite thrombosis prophylaxis.\n\nIn a prospective study, Hamann et al 158 treated 15 limbs of 13 patients with GSV aneurysm, located within 2 cm of the SFJ. Four aneurysms were surgically excised, with proximal ligation, because they were located near the SFJ and had a diameter >3 cm. The other 11 were treated with endovenous ablation alone. A generous amount of tumescent anesthesia was used to diminish the aneurysm as much as possible. Additional energy was applied in the aneurysmal segment, either 100 Joules/cm for EVLA or 3 energy cycles for RFA. No patient had DVT or thrombus extension into the femoral vein. At 1 year, none of the aneurysms were visible on duplex. Three patients needed retreatment for partial or segmental recanalization, with good result. Thromboprophylaxis was given to patients with a history of VTE or SVT.\n\nFurther experience with larger number of patients is needed to recommend endovenous ablation alone for treatment of large aneurysms or for those located <3 cm to the SFJ or SPJ. One of the main reasons for this study is that current North American guidelines suggest placement of the tip of thermal ablation catheters ≥2 cm distal to the SFJ.\n\n15.
