  "title": "Hyperinsulinemic Normoglycemia during Cardiac Surgery reduces a Composite of 30-day Mortality and Serious In-hospital Complications: A Randomized Clinical Trial",
  "abstract": "Background:: Hyperinsulinemic normoglycemia augments myocardial glucose uptake and utilization. We tested the hypothesis that hyperinsulinemic normoglycemia reduces 30-day mortality and morbidity after cardiac surgery.\n\nMethods:: This dual-center, parallel group, superiority trial randomized cardiac surgical patients between August 2007 and March 2015 at the Cleveland Clinic and Royal Victoria Hospital to intraoperative glycemic management with: 1)hyperinsulinemic normoglycemia, a fixed high-dose insulin and concomitant variable glucose infusion titrated to glucose concentrations of 80–110 mg·dL −1 ; or 2)standard glycemic management, low-dose insulin infusion targeting glucose >150 mg·dL −1 . The primary outcome was a composite of 30-day mortality, mechanical circulatory support, infection, renal or neurologic morbidity. Interim analyses were planned at each 12.5% enrollment of maximum 2,790 patients.\n\nResults:: At the third interim analysis (N=1,439; hyperinsulinemic normoglycemia 709, standard glycemic management 730; 52% planned maximum), the efficacy boundary was crossed and study stopped per protocol . Time-weighted average glucose concentration (means±SDs) with hyperinsulinemic normoglycemia was 108±20 versus 150±33 mg·dL −1 with standard glycemic management, P<0.001. At least one component of the composite outcome occurred in 49(6.9%) patients receiving hyperinsulinemic normoglycemia versus 82(11.2%) receiving standard glucose management (P<efficacy boundary 0.0085); estimated relative risk (95%interim-adjusted CI) 0.62(0.39,0.97), P=0.0043. There was a treatment-by-site interaction ( P =0.063); relative risk for the composite outcome was 0.49(0.26,0.91, P =0.0007, N=921) at Royal Victoria Hospital, but 0.96(0.41,2.24, P=0.89, N=518) at the Cleveland Clinic. Severe hypoglycemia (<40 mg·dL −1 ) occurred in 6(0.9%) patients.\n\nConclusions:: Intraoperative hyperinsulinemic normoglycemia reduced mortality and morbidity after cardiac surgery. Providing exogenous glucose while targeting normoglycemia may be preferable to simply normalizing glucose concentrations.",
