Although surgery remains the standard treatment for clinical stage IA NSCLC with generally favorable prognosis, recurrence and poor outcomes are not uncommon, particularly among patients harboring pathological high-risk features [ 3 , 4 ].\n\nPathological risk factors such as solid or micropapillary predominant histology, cribriform architecture, lymphovascular invasion (LVI), and spread through air spaces (STAS) have been independently associated with worse recurrence-free and overall survival [ 4 – 7 ]. These features, however, are typically confirmed only after surgery through final pathology, which limits their utility in guiding preoperative decisions. Intraoperative frozen section (FS) can offer early insight, but its accuracy in predicting aggressive subtypes remains limited [ 8 ]. Consequently, a practical need exists for a preoperative risk stratification tool that integrates readily available clinical, imaging, and histological variables.\n\nThe left upper lobe (LUL) of the lung presents unique anatomical and surgical challenges. Compared with other lobes, the LUL is frequently affected by early-stage adenocarcinoma and offers a variety of segmental resection strategies (e.g., S1 + 2, S1 + 2 + 3, S4 + 5) [ 9 – 11 ]. Recent randomized trials (e.g., JCOG0802, CALGB/ALLIANCE 140503) have demonstrated the non-inferiority of segmentectomy for tumors ≤ 2 cm [ 9 , 12 ]. However, in the presence of high-risk pathological features, limited resection may compromise oncologic outcomes [ 10 ]. Therefore, reliable preoperative identification of high-risk pathology is essential for optimizing surgical planning and selecting appropriate candidates for sublobar resection.\n\nTo date, few studies have developed predictive models tailored specifically to cIA lung adenocarcinoma located in the LUL. Most existing nomograms are based on heterogeneous tumor locations and lack focus on the anatomic and clinical nuances of the LUL [ 4 , 13 ]. Addressing this gap, the present study aims to develop and validate a nomogram for predicting high-risk pathological features in patients with clinical stage IA LUL adenocarcinoma. By combining preoperative serum carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels, CT-derived metrics, and intraoperative frozen section results, we seek to provide a practical tool to facilitate individualized, risk-adapted surgical decision-making.\n\nMaterials and methods\n\nStudy population\n\nThis study retrospectively analyzed patients with primary lung adenocarcinoma in the upper lobe of the left lung who underwent partial lung resection at our hospital between January 2018 and May 2022. The inclusion criteria were as follows: (I) clinical diagnosis of stage IA disease; (II) confirmed lung adenocarcinoma, including minimally invasive adenocarcinoma (MIA) or invasive adenocarcinoma (IAC); (III) tumor is located in the upper lobe of the left lung and (IV) patients who underwent surgery, including wedge resection, segmental resection, or lobectomy. The exclusion criteria were as follows: (I) patients who received preoperative neoadjuvant therapy; (II) patients with contraindications to anesthesia or surgery, such as severe uncompensated cardiopulmonary diseases or significant bleeding disorders; (III) patients with non-adenocarcinoma lung cancers, including small cell lung cancer, squamous carcinoma, large cell lung cancer, atypical adenomatous hyperplasia, adenocarcinoma in situ, or mucinous adenocarcinoma and other variants of adenocarcinoma were excluded from the study; (IV) patients with multiple primary lung adenocarcinomas. Multiple primary lung adenocarcinomas were defined and diagnosed according to the Martini-Melamed criteria, supplemented by histologic and radiological assessments in accordance with the 2015 WHO classification. In cases where differentiation between independent primaries and intrapulmonary metastasis was ambiguous, multidisciplinary discussions were held to reach a diagnostic consensus [ 14 ]. All patients were staged according to the 9th edition of the TNM staging system, as presented by the American Joint Committee on Cancer, and histopathologic classification was performed according to the IASLC/ATS/ERS multidisciplinary classification. The patient selection algorithm is illustrated in Fig. 1 . A total of 545 patients were included in this study.\n\nThe data analyzed in this study were obtained from a collected database. All procedures adhered to the principles outlined in the Declaration of Helsinki and received approval from the Clinical Research Ethics Committee of the hospital (approval number: ZRJY2023-QM34). Due to the retrospective nature of the study, the requirement for informed consent was waived.\n\nPreoperative evaluation\n\nAll patients underwent routine preoperative clinical staging, which included lung function testing, high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) of the chest, serum tumor markers (e.g., carcinoembryonic antigen [CEA] and Cyfra21-1).\n\nHRCT is frequently used to assess lung conditions before surgery. For each patient, experienced thoracic surgeons measure and record various parameters, including the maximum diameter of the lung nodule, the size of the implementation component, the consolidation-tumor ratio (CTR), tumor location, mean CT value, and relevant imaging features (e.g., lobulation sign, spiculated sign, irregularity, pleural indentation sign). These measurements are performed using the lung window level setting.\n\nThe CTR is defined as the ratio of the maximum solid diameter to the maximum tumor diameter, where a value of 0 indicates a pure ground-glass nodule, and a value of 1 indicates a pure solid nodule.\n\nThe assessment of preoperative lymph node and extrapulmonary metastases is primarily conducted by medical imaging specialist. If necessary, a lymph node aspiration biopsy and magnetic resonance imaging or PET/CT are performed to confirm the diagnosis.\n\nSurgical treatment\n\nAll surgeries are performed by experienced thoracic surgeons. Intraoperative frozen section analysis was performed for the initial diagnosis of the nodule’s nature, and hilar and mediastinal lymph nodes were routinely examined and cleared. All specimens were subsequently sent to the Department of Pathology for pathomorphological examination, immunohistochemical staining and genetic testing.\n\nStatistical analysis\n\nPatient’s data, including basic information, clinical characteristics, perioperative outcomes, and procedure-related data, were systematically recorded. These data encompassed gender, age, preoperative comorbidities, body mass index (BMI), preoperative CEA and Cyfra21-1 levels, as well as imaging-related information such as tumor size and location, CTR, and mean CT values and so on. Additional information recorded included the procedure, duration of tube placement, intraoperative bleeding, and postoperative complications. The frozen section reported the pathologic typing and the final pathology detailed histologic typing, gene mutations, lymph node and pleural invasion, LVI and STAS.\n\nAll radiological features were independently evaluated by two experienced thoracic radiologists, and pathological slides were reviewed independently by two senior pulmonary pathologists. In cases of disagreement or diagnostic uncertainty—such as borderline nodules, satellite lesions, or ambiguous histologic patterns—consensus was reached through multidisciplinary case review meetings involving radiologists, pathologists, and thoracic surgeons to ensure consistency and accuracy.\n\nHigh-risk pathology was defined as the presence of one or more of the following components: (1) high-grade histologic subtypes such as solid or micropapillary predominant patterns; (2) complex glandular morphology, including sieve-like or cribriform architecture; and (3) adverse pathological features such as STAS and LVI. This composite definition was guided by the IASLC/ATS/ERS international classification of lung adenocarcinoma [ 15 ], which recognizes solid and micropapillary patterns as poor prognostic subtypes, and supported by evidence from prior studies indicating the prognostic significance of STAS and LVI. Recent pathological research, including the IASLC grading proposal by Moreira et al. [ 16 ], has highlighted the prognostic impact of complex glandular structures, which are associated with significantly worse recurrence-free and overall survival.\n\nThe study dataset was randomly divided into a training set (80%, n = 436) and a validation set (20%, n = 109), continuous variables were expressed as median (interquartile range), while categorical variables were presented as numbers (percentages).Baseline comparisons between the two sets were performed using the Mann-Whitney U test for continuous variables and Chi-square/Fisher’s exact test for categorical variables, confirming balanced distributions (all p > 0.05). In the training set, differences between high-risk and non-high-risk groups were assessed. Univariate logistic regression was performed to identify potential predictors of high-risk pathology (excluding variables related to surgery and postoperative pathology). The discriminative ability of each variable was evaluated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Variables meeting the criteria ( P < 0.05 and AUC > 0.65) were selected for bidirectional stepwise multivariate logistic regression model to identify independent predictors. To corroborate variable selection, we additionally performed LASSO (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator) logistic regression with 10-fold cross-validation. Two penalty parameters were examined: λ.min, which minimizes cross-validation error, and λ.1se, which yields the most parsimonious model within one standard error of the minimum. Predictors with non-zero coefficients at each λ were recorded and compared with those selected by traditional logistic regression. Events-per-variable (EPV) were calculated to gauge sample adequacy. A variance inflation factor (VIF) ≤ 5 indicates that there is no covariance between the variables in the final model. Based on the multivariate model, a nomogram for predicting high-risk pathology was developed. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, calibration curves and decision curve analysis (DCA) were also performed in both training and validation sets to evaluate the discriminative ability, calibrating ability and clinical utility of the model. In addition, Optimal thresholds for continuous predictors were also calculated using Youden’s index in the training set to maximize sensitivity and specificity and guide clinical practice. To assess the robustness and internal stability of model performance in the validation cohort, we performed non-parametric bootstrap resampling (1,000 iterations) to generate an empirical distribution of AUC values. The 95% confidence interval was calculated using the percentile method. All statistical analyses were performed using R software (version 4.4.3). p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.\n\nResult\n\nPatient clinicopathological characteristics\n\nIn this study, we retrospectively analyzed 545 patients diagnosed with cIA lung adenocarcinoma located in the upper lobe of the left lung who underwent thoracic surgery. Of these patients, 104 were classified as having a high-risk pathology type based on the final pathology, yielding a high-risk pathology prevalence of 19.08%. The cohort was randomly divided into a training set (80%, n = 436) and a validation set (20%, n = 109). No significant differences were observed between the training and validation sets in terms of demographic, clinical, or pathological variables ( P > 0.05 for all), confirming balanced randomization (Table 1 ). In the training set, high-risk patients were significantly older (median age: 61.5 vs. 58.0 years, P = 0.015) and had higher levels of CEA (2.83 vs. 1.56 ng/mL, P < 0.001), Cyfra21-1 (2.54 vs. 2.28 ng/mL, P = 0.031). Patients in the high-risk group had significantly larger tumors (1.70 vs. 1.20 cm, P < 0.001) and significantly higher mean CT values ([−271.39] HU vs. [−492.41] HU, P < 0.001). The likelihood of having a tumor with a CTR > 50% was significantly greater in the high-risk group than in the non-high-risk group (50% vs. 21.63%, p < 0.001). Furthermore, the spiculated sign (56.25% vs. 24.44%, p < 0.001) and lobulation sign (50.00% vs. 23.88%, p < 0.001) were significantly more prevalent in the high-risk group. There were no statistically significant differences between the two groups in terms of preoperative comorbidities, BMI, postoperative complications and the location of the primary tumor (Table 2 ).\n\nHistopathological outcomes\n\nThe high-risk group predominantly exhibited IAC ( n = 75, 93.75%) as the pathological type reported by the frozen section, with tumor sizes most commonly ranging from 1 to 2 cm ( n = 58, 72.5%). Regarding genetic mutations, three ALK mutation was detected, while EGFR mutations(37.50% vs. 30.90%, p = 0.253) were more prevalent, though the difference between the two groups was not statistically significant.\n\nUnivariate and multivariate analysis of predictors of high-risk pathology\n\nUnivariate analysis identified five variables significantly associated with high-risk pathology ( P < 0.05 and AUC > 0.65), including frozen section (AUC = 0.7258), CEA (AUC = 0.6669), CT size (AUC = 0.7339), Spiculated sign (AUC = 0.6591) and mean CT value (AUC = 0.7666) (Table 3 ). LASSO sensitivity analysis: LASSO with λ.min retained eight predictors, whereas λ.1se yielded a four-variable set identical to that in our final multivariable model (Supplementary Figure S1 and Table S1). Multivariate analysis confirmed four independent predictors: frozen section (OR = 5.23, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.87 ~ 14.59, P = 0.002), CEA (OR = 1.24, 95%CI: 1.04 ~ 1.48, P = 0.018), CT size (OR = 2.16, 95%CI:1.16 ~ 4.04, P = 0.016), and mean CT value (OR = 1.01, 95%CI: 1.01 ~ 1.01, P < 0.001) (Table 4 ). Variance inflation factor (VIF) values were calculated for the final set of predictors, all of which were < 2, indicating negligible collinearity. The model’s events-per-variable (EPV) ratio was 26, ensuring adequate sample size for multivariable modeling.\n\nNomogram construction\n\nBased on the results of multivariate logistic regression analysis, a nomogram was constructed (Fig. 2 ). Scores were assigned in accordance with the regression coefficients of each variable in the model, where the score for each factor was proportional to its contribution to the overall risk prediction. The individual scores for each risk factor were then summed to yield a total score, which corresponds to the probability of developing high-risk pathology.\n\nModel performance\n\nThe model demonstrated excellent discriminative ability in the training set (AUC = 0.837, 95% CI: 0.790–0.884) and validation set (AUC = 0.865, 95% CI: 0.790–0.939) (Fig. 3 ). Calibration curves showed strong agreement between predicted and observed risks, with minimal bias (MAE = 0.021 in the training set; MAE = 0.036 in the validation set) (Fig. 4 ). DCA revealed that the model provided higher net benefit than “treat-all” or “treat-none” strategies across clinically relevant risk thresholds (Fig. 5 ). To further validate the robustness of the model in the independent validation cohort, we conducted bootstrap resampling (1,000 iterations) to estimate the distribution of AUC values. The average AUC in the validation set was 0.864 (95% CI:0.785–0.930), indicating stable and consistent discriminative performance (Supplementary Figure S2). The distribution of bootstrap AUCs further confirmed that the model maintained strong performance across resampled datasets. These findings suggest that the predictive model maintained consistent discriminative performance across repeated sampling, reinforcing its potential clinical applicability even in moderate-sized cohorts.\n\nCut-off determination\n\nThree continuous variables were used to predict high-risk pathology, including CEA, CT size and mean CT value. With regard to the cut-off value obtained by the ROC curve, the cut-off value of CEA was 2.2ng/ml (AUC = 0.72, 95%CI:0.65 ~ 0.78). The cut-off value of the CT size was 1.22 cm (AUC = 0.73, 95%CI:0.67 ~ 0.79) and the cut-off value of the mean CT value was − 451.55 HU (AUC = 0.77, 95%CI:0.71 ~ 0.82). These thresholds were externally validated in the validation set. In addition to continuous variable thresholds, we determined an optimal cutoff probability of 0.192 for the nomogram-predicted risk of high-risk pathology, based on Youden’s index. This value maximized sensitivity and specificity in the training cohort and may serve as a reference point for clinical decision-making.\n\nDiscussion\n\nOur study provides a comprehensive analysis of factors predictive of high-risk pathology in cIA lung adenocarcinoma of the left upper lobe. Through rigorous statistical analysis, we identified four independent predictors: elevated preoperative CEA levels, larger tumor CT size, IAC reported by frozen section and higher mean CT value. These findings deepen our understanding of early-stage lung adenocarcinoma and highlight the clinical value of incorporating preoperative data into tailored surgical planning.\n\nCEA is one of the most widely used tumor markers in lung cancer, although its role in early-stage disease remains debated [ 17 ]. The analysis revealed that preoperative CEA levels > 2.2 ng/ml conferred a 24% increased risk of high-risk pathology (OR = 1.24), which indirectly suggests a link between elevated CEA levels and poor prognosis in early-stage disease. Similar associations between CEA and adverse outcomes in NSCLC have been reported in earlier research, lending support to our results [ 18 ]. Elevated CEA levels likely reflect underlying molecular alterations, such as genetic mutations or the activation of signaling pathways associated with increased metastatic potential [ 19 ]. These findings support the clinical utility of CEA testing as a preoperative marker for patients without significant metastatic disease but with elevated CEA levels, who may benefit from more intensive follow-up or adjuvant therapy.\n\nThe biological heterogeneity and histologic subtypes of lung adenocarcinoma are critical in determining prognosis. In the various histologic classifications of lung adenocarcinoma, IAC accounts for the majority of surgical cases and often comprises multiple complex subtypes. Although invasive subtypes, such as solid and micropapillary patterns, are relatively rare, they have significant prognostic implications [ 20 ]. Solid-predominant adenocarcinomas are characterized by reduced glandular differentiation and are associated with more aggressive behavior, while micropapillary-predominant adenocarcinomas are marked by small clusters of tumor cells, often accompanied by vascular and mesenchymal invasion [ 15 ]. Intraoperative frozen section has been shown to have a high degree of concordance with final pathology [ 8 ], our study suggests that frozen section identification of IAC emerged as the most powerful predictor, reinforcing its value in guiding intraoperative decisions.\n\nImaging remains indispensable for detecting and characterizing lung cancer. While pathological diagnosis remains the gold standard for cancer differentiation, imaging, as a non-invasive modality, offers distinct advantages. For instance, HRCT can clearly delineate high-risk imaging features, such as tumor density, location and size, thereby aiding surgeons in optimizing surgical planning [ 21 ]. Relevant studies have demonstrated that increased tumor density and size correlate with higher malignancy grades [ 22 ], a finding consistent with our results. In our study, tumors exhibiting higher mean CT values were associated with a greater proportion of their solid component, potentially reflecting a higher degree of malignancy.\n\nAdvances in the surgical management of NSCLC have aimed to achieve optimal oncological outcomes while preserving lung function. The upper lobe of the left lung is anatomically comparable to the upper and middle lobes of the right lung and offers relatively more surgical approach options. Although lobectomy remains the standard surgical procedure, sublobar resection is increasingly considered as an alternative for smaller tumors located in the upper lobe of the left lung. Results from related trials (JCOG0802/WJOG4607L and CALGB/ALLIANCE 140503) indicate that segmental resection may be more advantageous when the pulmonary nodule is ≤ 2 cm in size, exhibits a relatively smaller CTR, and is situated in a more peripheral region of the lung lobe, thus leading to improved outcomes while preserving lung function [ 9 , 12 ]. Additionally, existing studies indicate that postoperative lung function deteriorates as the number of resected segments increases [ 23 ]. Specifically, in cases of lung cancers located in the apical segment of the left lung, thoracic surgeons may prefer performing S1 + 2 segmental resection over S1 + 2 + 3 segmental resection or left upper lobectomy, provided that the tumor margins remain clear [ 11 ]. However, when the tumor is diagnosed as invasive adenocarcinoma—especially with predominant micropapillary or solid subtypes —the risk of early recurrence is elevated. In such cases, the paradox emerges: preserving lung function may result in insufficient tumor resection. Additionally, high-risk pathological features are typically identified only through the FP report, which is available 7–10 days post-surgery. Consequently, it is crucial for surgeons to enhance their preoperative ability to predict the presence of high-risk pathological components in lung adenocarcinoma. Our study provides insights to help thoracic surgeons make more informed decisions regarding surgical and therapeutic strategies for patients at high risk, ultimately improving prognosis and oncological outcomes.\n\nUsing the data-derived threshold of 0.192, patients with predicted probabilities exceeding this cutoff may be more appropriately managed with lobectomy, given the elevated risk of recurrence associated with high-grade histologic features [ 24 ]. In contrast, patients falling below this threshold may be suitable candidates for lung-sparing procedures without compromising oncological safety. This tailored strategy aims to optimize oncologic control while preserving lung function and enhancing quality of life. Importantly, while our study did not directly evaluate long-term survival outcomes stratified by surgical modality and predicted risk, prior studies have consistently demonstrated that high-risk histologic subtypes are associated with poorer recurrence-free and overall survival [ 16 , 25 ]. Future prospective trials are required to determine whether nomogram-guided surgical decision-making can translate into improved patient outcomes. Until such data are available, our model provides a valuable adjunct to conventional decision-making criteria and may help identify patients for whom more aggressive surgical approaches or postoperative adjuvant strategies should be considered.\n\nThis study has several limitations. First, its retrospective single-center design may introduce selection and information bias, despite the use of strict inclusion/exclusion criteria and standardized assessments by experienced radiologists and pathologists. Unmeasured confounding cannot be entirely excluded. Second, although the model showed strong internal validity through hold-out and bootstrap validation (AUC = 0.837 and 0.865), it lacks external validation. A multicenter prospective study is underway to assess generalizability across broader populations. Third, the optimal cutoff value (19.2%) determined by Youden’s index has not yet been tested in clinical practice. Further studies are needed to confirm its utility in guiding surgical decisions. Fourth, due to limited follow-up, the model does not incorporate long-term outcomes such as recurrence or survival, which are essential for assessing prognostic value. Fifth, while logistic regression was selected for its clinical interpretability, we acknowledge that machine learning techniques may offer superior performance. Future research may compare these approaches to identify optimal strategies. Lastly, although variance inflation factor (VIF) analysis and LASSO regression were used to address multicollinearity and prevent overfitting, some risk remains due to the limited number of outcome events. Additionally, potential interactions between preoperative biomarkers (e.g., CEA) and imaging features (e.g., CT value, tumor size) were not modeled to preserve simplicity. These interactions will be explored in future prospective analyses.\n\nConclusion\n\nOur study identified several independent predictors of high-risk pathological features in cIA lung adenocarcinoma located in the LUL in patients with IAC, characterized by preoperative CEA levels exceeding 2.2 ng/mL, elevated mean CT values over [−451.55] HU and tumor image size larger than 1.22 cm, surgeons should exercise heightened caution when determining the surgical approach. Careful preoperative planning is essential to avoid incomplete resection. Additionally, the need for adjuvant treatments to improve tumor prognosis should be considered. The nomogram offers a reliable preoperative tool for risk assessment and surgical planning in early-stage left upper lobe adenocarcinoma. However, further research is required to confirm whether these findings can be consistently applied in clinical practice.\n\nSupplementary Information\n\nSupplementary Material 1.
