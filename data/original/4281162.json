All DC vaccines exhibited high expression of CD80, CD83, CD86, and leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DR (Fig. 1 A and B). Importantly, the chemokine receptor CCR7, necessary for DC migration to the lymph node, was upregulated on the cell surface, whereas CD14 expression was negative on DC (Fig. 1 A and B). Altogether, production of DC vaccines was successful in all subjects from a single leukapheresis procedure.\n\nAll study subjects experienced transient local redness and mild swelling of the injection site. Two of four healthy subjects reported of mild headache, and another volunteer reported transient mild myalgia. No serious adverse events were reported in the healthy subjects. One allo-HSCT patient (PT002) developed a moderate grade II graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) of the gastrointestinal tract 6 days after the first DC vaccination; she received immunosuppressive treatment accordingly and was excluded from further participation in the trial. Overall, DC vaccination targeting CMV pp65 was well tolerated in healthy subjects, but requires careful monitoring of GVHD effects in allo-HSCT recipients.\n\nEfficacy\n\nIn the healthy volunteers’ group and patients’ group, CMV pp65 antigenemia remained negative throughout the follow-up period, neither did vaccination result in immunoglobulin (Ig) G nor IgM seroconversion (data not shown), indicative of control of CMV infection.\n\nDendritic cell vaccination did not affect the relative frequencies of circulating lymphocyte subsets (CD3+, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, Vdelta2-negative gamma delta T cells, B cells, and natural killer cells), as determined by immunophenotypic analyses ( Table S1, SDC , http://links.lww.com/TP/B18 ). Furthermore, in one healthy volunteer (HV004), the relative frequencies of naive (CD45RA+CD62L+), terminally differentiated effector (CD45RA+CD62L−), effector memory (CD45RA−CD62L−), and central memory (CD45RA−CD62L+) subsets within the CD3+CD4+ and CD3+CD8+ T-cell compartments were additionally tested and remained similar post-DC vaccination as compared to pre-DC vaccination (data not shown).\n\nTo detect CMV pp65-specific interferon (IFN)-γ–producing T cells, cryopreserved peripheral blood monocyte cells (PBMC) from healthy volunteers and patients were used in an IFN-γ enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot (ELISpot) assay after in vitro rechallenge with CMV pp65 antigens. Three of four healthy volunteers could be defined as CMV pp65-specific immune responders after completion of the DC vaccination cycle, according to the response definition criteria (Fig. 2 A–D). Overall, there was a significant increase in the level of expansion of CMV-specific IFN-γ-producing T cells after DC vaccination (Fig. 2 E). Furthermore, although both efficacy-evaluable allo-HSCT patients presented a CMV pp65-specific T-cell response already before DC vaccination, one patient (PT001) displayed a threefold increase in CMV pp65-specific spot-forming cells on completion of the DC vaccination trial (Fig. 3 A and B).\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nCMV disease is an important risk factor in immunocompromised patients and can result from primary infection (CMV-seronegative recipients) or from reinfection or reactivation (in CMV-seropositive recipients) after solid organ transplantation and allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.\n\nWe evaluated the use of DC vaccination as a possible strategy to prevent infectious complications of CMV disease. We demonstrated that vaccination with CMV pp65 mRNA-loaded monocyte-derived DC is a safe way to induce or enhance CMV-specific cellular immunity. No acute serious adverse events occurred in any of the four healthy volunteers receiving 4 weekly administered doses of the DC vaccine. Similar observations were made in two of three patients with a hematologic malignancy receiving allo-HSCT. Given the possible risk for development of GVHD after immune-stimulatory therapy, induction or worsening of alloreactivity in the allogeneic HSCT recipients was carefully monitored and the number of injected DC used per vaccine was substantially reduced (100-fold) as compared to “routine” DC injections. One patient (PT002), recipient of a matched unrelated donor graft, developed a moderate grade II GVHD of the gastrointestinal tract. Although the incidence of GVHD is increased in HLA-matched unrelated donors as compared to matched-related donors, with rates of 70% to 90%, 24 we cannot rule out a causative relationship between DC vaccination and GVHD. Indeed, because the onset of GVHD occurred 6 days after the first vaccination, one possible explanation might be that donor-derived DC stimulated or expanded alloreactive donor T cells. The patient received appropriate immunosuppressive therapy and was excluded from further participation in the current trial. In agreement with our observations, Grigoleit et al. 25 reported in a previous phase I-II clinical trial that vaccination with donor-derived DC was safe in allo-HSCT recipients (n = 24): no serious adverse events were reported, except for one patient who developed acute grade III GVHD of the skin and gut 2 months after vaccination.\n\nSecond, vaccination with CMV pp65 mRNA-loaded monocyte-derived DC is feasible because successful production of four DC vaccines was achieved after one single leukapheresis procedure per subject. Importantly, as little as 0.1×10 6 DC per vaccine seemed to be sufficient to enhance a CMV-specific T-cell response in one patient (Fig. 3 A), adding observations to the ongoing debate regarding the number of DC required to initiate an immune response. 26 , 27\n\nTo assess the efficacy of DC vaccination, we studied the control of CMV infection, as well as the induction and expansion of CMV-specific T-cell responses. The CMV pp65 antigenemia in peripheral blood leukocytes was used to predict the development of CMV disease in transplant patients. 28 , 29 Transplant recipients are usually at high risk of developing CMV disease. In the context of allo-HSCT, the risk of transmission of CMV by the cell product from a CMV-seropositive donor to a CMV-seronegative recipient is approximately 30%. 30 - 32 In contrast, without prophylaxis approximately 80% of CMV-seropositive patients experience CMV infection after allo-HSCT. In this study, none of the allo-HSCT recipients, including PT002 who did not complete the entire vaccination cycle, developed primary CMV infection or reactivation, as evidenced by negative CMV pp65 antigenemia in all patients throughout a 6-month follow-up period. Furthermore, at month 6, both patients were negative for CMV DNA by PCR analysis. These results are promising but need further confirmation in larger cohorts with long-term follow-up.\n\nMore recently, there has been great interest in using methods to determine CMV-specific immune reconstitution after HSCT as an additional strategy to determine the risk of CMV infection. Indeed, it has been demonstrated that lack of CMV-specific CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocyte responses predisposes to CMV infection, whereas reconstitution of these responses after HSCT correlates with protection from CMV and improved outcome of CMV disease. 33 , 34 In this study, DC vaccination resulted in de novo induction of CMV-specific T-cell responses in three of four CMV-seronegative healthy volunteers, and a marked increase (threefold expansion) of IFN-γ-producing spot-forming cells was demonstrated in one of two allo-SCT patients. In the other patient, allo-HSCT PT003, the CMV-specific T-cell response was not boosted on completion of the vaccination cycle, but this subject already showed a high CMV-specific T-cell response at the beginning of the study. Importantly, the observed effects were not dependent on the CMV serostatus. This is in marked contrast to established protocols for the generation of sufficient numbers of donor-derived CMV-specific T cells for adoptive immunotherapy, in which the donor has to be CMV seropositive. 35 Moreover, the use of DC has advantages over adoptive T-cell transfer because DC can amplify virus-specific T cells in vivo. In contrast, up to 8 weeks of in vitro culture are required to obtain enough CMV-specific T cells and to deplete alloreactive T cells, whereas preparation of DC vaccines can be realized after one leukapheresis procedure.\n\nIn conclusion, our DC vaccination strategy induced or expanded a CMV-specific cellular response in four of six efficacy-evaluable study subjects, providing a base for its further exploration in larger cohorts.\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\n\nSubjects\n\nFour CMV-naive healthy volunteers and three patients who underwent allo-HSCT were included in the current study. Detailed medical history, physical examination, and routine laboratory tests revealed no relevant abnormalities in healthy volunteers. Exclusion criteria were (i) difficult peripheral venous access and (ii) medication with an immunomodulatory effect, including administration of vaccines in a period of 100 days before the first DC vaccination and 100 days after the fourth DC vaccination. Cytomegalovirus-naive serostatus was defined as the absence of both CMV-specific IgG and IgM, as determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Diasorin, Saluggia, Italy). The leukapheresis procedure for vaccine production in patients who underwent allo-HSCT was performed 4 weeks after transplantation. Two of three patients were CMV-seropositive, as defined by CMV IgG>0.4 IU/mL. All stem cell donors showed positive levels of CMV-specific IgG. Cytomegalovirus antigenemia and CMV-specific IgM was negative at the start of vaccination for all three patients.\n\nThe study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Antwerp University Hospital, according to the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki, and all subjects gave written informed consent. Demographic and clinical data are summarized in Table 2 .\n\nTrial Design\n\nStudy subjects received a total of four intradermal clinical-grade DC vaccines on a weekly interval ( Figure S1, SDC, http://links.lww.com/TP/B18 ) at a dose of 10×10 6 or 0.1×10 6 DC per vaccination for HV and allo-HSCT patients, respectively. DC vaccines were injected at the ventromedial region of the upper arm, approximately 5-10 centimeters from the axillary lymph nodes. Primary endpoints, that is, safety and toxicity, were graded at every visit both clinically as by routine laboratory hematology and biochemistry testing.\n\nVaccine Preparation\n\nClinical-grade DC vaccines were prepared after a single leukapheresis of nonmobilized blood and immunomagnetic selection of CD14+ monocytes using a CliniMACS device (Miltenyi Biotec, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany) as described previously. 36 - 38 Briefly, isolated CD14+ monocytes were cultured in CellGro medium (CellGenix, Freiburg, Germany) supplemented with 1% human AB serum (MP Biomedicals, Belgium), granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor and interleukin-4 (Gentaur, Brussels, Belgium). Maturation was induced at day 6 through addition of tumor necrosis factor-α and prostaglandin E 2 (Pharmacia Upjohn, Puurs, Belgium) for 48 hr. At day 8, mature DC were harvested, electroporated with CMV pp65 mRNA 19 (Curevac GmbH, Tübingen, Germany) and viably cryopreserved in ready-to-use aliquots at −80°C. After thawing, the vaccine was resuspended in 500 μL 0.9% NaCl solution and delivered to the clinic for intradermal administration. Cell count and viability were analyzed at various time intervals of vaccine preparation (Table 1 ). For each DC vaccine, the expression of CD80, CD86, CD14, HLA-DR, CD83, and CCR7 was evaluated by multiparametric flow cytometry using the following antibodies (purchased from BD Biosciences, Erembodegem, Belgium; unless stated otherwise): anti-CD80 phycoerythrin (PE), anti-CD86 PE, anti-CD14 fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC), anti-HLA-DR peridinin chlorophyll protein complex (PerCP), anti-CD83 FITC (Life Technologies, Ghent, Belgium) and anti-CCR7 PE (R&D Systems, Abingdon, UK).\n\nImmunomonitoring\n\nThe secondary endpoint was to assess the ability of DC to induce or enhance CMV pp65-specific T-cell responses. To this end, 100 mL of peripheral blood was taken immediately before the first vaccination (PRE) and 1 month after the fourth vaccination (POST) ( Figure S1, SDC, http://links.lww.com/TP/B18 ). Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated, cryopreserved viably and thawed for batch analysis.\n\nLymphocyte Subsets\n\nFor immunophenotyping of lymphocyte subsets, the following murine antihuman monoclonal antibodies were used for direct immunofluorescence staining (all antibodies were purchased from BD Biosciences unless stated otherwise): anti-HLA-DR FITC, anti-CD38 PE, anti-CD62 ligand (CD62L) PE coupled to the cyanine dye Cy5 (PE-Cy5), anti-CD16 PE-Cy7, anti-CD56 PE-Cy7, anti-CD3 PerCP coupled to the cyanine dye Cy5.5 (PerCP-Cy5.5), anti-CD8 Pacific Blue (PB) (Dako, Heverlee, Belgium), anti-CD4 Alexa Fluor 700, CD45RA allophycocyanin (APC), anti-CD19 APC-Cy7, anti-V∂2TCR PE, anti-V∂ FITC (R&D Systems, Abingdon, United Kingdom). Labeled cells were analyzed on a CyFlow ML (Partec, Münster, Germany) flow cytometer. For analytical flow cytometry, at least 10 4 events with forward and side scatter properties of lymphocytes with CD3, CD4, or CD8 staining were measured. All data were analyzed using FlowJo software (Tree Star, San Carlos, CA).\n\nELISpot Analysis of Antigen-Specific T Cells\n\nDetection of functional CMV pp65-specific T cells was performed in a direct IFN-γ ELISpot assay using CMV pp65 mRNA-electroporated cryopreserved PBMC, as previously described. 39 Alternatively, cryopreserved autologous PBMC were stimulated with CMV pp65 mRNA-electroporated mature DC. After 7 days, PBMC were harvested and rechallenged with a CMV pp65 protein-spanning peptide pool of overlapping peptides for an additional 24 hr or left untreated as a control. Antigen-specific IFN-γ secretion after peptide stimulation was determined by an IFN-γ ELISpot assay (Diaclone, Amsterdam, The Netherlands), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Frequencies of antigen-specific IFN-γ–secreting cells were calculated based on the number of spots counted using an automated iSpot Reader system (AID GmbH, Strassburg, Germany). For the definition of a positive response, guidelines from the Cancer Vaccine Consortium were followed: per 10 6 PBMC, the mean antigen-specific spot count must be greater than or equal to 20 spots and at least two times as high as the background reactivity. 40\n\nStatistics\n\nComparisons were validated using a Student’s t test. A P value less than 0.05 was considered as statistically significant.",
