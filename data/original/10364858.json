Therefore, with estimated 20 million inguinal repairs performed each year 2 , each improvement in surgical technique translates into substantial public health benefits.\n\nMesh repairs have become standard practice for inguinal hernias 3 , 4 , as recurrence rates are lower than those associated with classical tissue repair 5 . Because recurrence rates are now low, the focus of technical improvements has shifted to outcomes such as chronic postoperative pain, which affects up to 30 per cent of all patients after inguinal hernia repair 6–8 . Chronic postoperative pain is classified by the ICD-11 as pain lasting more than 3 months after surgery 9 . This pain is often neuropathic in character, believed to be caused by tissue and nerve trauma induced by surgical dissection, as well as inflammation and a foreign body reaction owing to the suture material and mesh 10 , 11 .\n\nSome studies 12 , 13 have reported that the use of lightweight mesh is associated with decreased postoperative chronic pain compared with heavyweight mesh at 6 months after inguinal hernia repair. However, results are conflicting, as other studies 14 , 15 evaluating pain 3–5 years after surgery did not show such differences. Unfortunately, there are very limited long-term data addressing this topic from RCTs.\n\nThe purpose of this study was to evaluate the long-term impact of heavyweight or lightweight mesh on chronic pain, discomfort, and recurrence rates a decade after open anterior inguinal hernia repair. It was hypothesized that the lightweight mesh group would have less pain and discomfort than the heavyweight mesh group, whereas recurrence rates would be similar in the two groups.\n\nMethods\n\nThis was a follow-up study of a previous expertise-based, parallel-group RCT 16 , carried out at the regional centres Umeå University Hospital and Östersund Hospital, Sweden. In this study, men aged at least 25 years with a symptomatic unilateral inguinal hernia were randomized (1 : 1) to a group of surgeons that use either heavyweight (90 g/m 2 , Bard™ Flatmesh; Davol) or lightweight (28 g/m 2 , ULTRAPRO™; Ethicon) mesh. The age criterion was chosen to ensure a fully grown patient and acceptance of local anaesthesia. Patient exclusion criteria were: femoral hernias, unwillingness to participate, refusal of local anaesthesia, bleeding disorders, and concurrent use of anticoagulation therapy. The study was expertise-based, meaning that surgeons used the type of mesh they personally preferred, minimizing the probability of differential expertise bias 17 . The two groups of surgeons’ surgical experience was evaluated. Surgical trainees were allowed to participate provided they had reached surgical independence for primary inguinal hernia repair, for which a minimum of 20 unsupervised inguinal hernia repairs was required. The study group attested that the groups of surgeons for each intervention arm were sufficiently similar in terms of surgical experience. Specification of surgeon groups can be found in Table S1 . Randomization was stratified by centre and performed at the outpatient clinic, after consent for surgery had been obtained. The randomization did not include stratification for preoperative pain, and blinding of patients and surgeons was not achieved. The random allocation sequence was computer-generated by a statistician by means of a random number technique. Allocation was obtained for each patient from a central web-based server ( https://www.norrlandskirurgi.se ). The program concealed the allocation sequence.\n\nA standardized manual for carrying out the operation was distributed and used by all participating surgeons. Additionally, surgeons had to undertake two operations under supervision before being accepted to participate in the study. This report of long-term results is written according to the CONSORT 2010 guideline 18 .\n\nAll patients provided informed consent to participate in the present study, which was conducted according to the latest revision of Declaration of Helsinki and approved by the ethical review board at Umeå University.\n\nStudy design\n\nOf 412 patients randomized, 363 were analysed in the original trial. These patients were cross-checked against the Swedish population registry, using the national personal registration number 19 , 9–12 years after the inguinal hernia repair, to exclude those who had died. Information about the follow-up study and questionnaires were sent out to the remaining 320 patients, and a research nurse contacted all patients who could be reached by telephone and asked if they were willing to take part in the present follow-up study. The questionnaire consisted of the first item of the Short-Form Inguinal Pain Questionnaire (sf-IPQ) 20 , the McCarthy visual analogue scale 21 , and a set of study-specific questions. The data were inserted and matched into a Microsoft Access ® database (version 14; Microsoft, Redmond, Washington, USA) together with the baseline data from the previous study, and double-checked for errors. Linkage was also made to the national Swedish Hernia Register to obtain data on reoperations for recurrence or chronic pain. Baseline data collected for the previous study included patient age, BMI, preoperative pain measured with the McCarthy pain scale during normal activity, patient-reported preoperative regular pain medication, hernia type, ASA fitness grade, operated side, duration of operation, study centre, and information on surgical experience of the two groups of surgeons participating in the study.\n\nStudy measures\n\nThe exposure of the study was the type of mesh used for the primary inguinal hernia repair, either heavyweight or lightweight. The main outcome was the occurrence of chronic pain 9–12 years after open anterior inguinal hernia repair with the standardized Lichtenstein technique. The primary outcome, the first item of the sf-IPQ, comprises a seven-grade ordinal scale measuring the impact of pain in the groin on different daily activities, whereas the McCarthy visual analogue scale, which ranges from 0 to 150 mm, measures the mean intensity of pain during the past week. Other secondary outcomes evaluated were patient-reported awareness of a groin lump (yes or no), perception of foreign material in the groin (yes or no), loss of skin sensation in the operated groin (yes or no), other discomfort or pain located in the groin (yes or no), and the patient’s impression of groin symptoms compared with before surgery (better, no change or worse) as well as overall satisfaction with the surgery (completely satisfied, mostly satisfied, mostly unsatisfied or completely unsatisfied). Reoperations for recurrences and patient-perceived recurrences were also compared between mesh groups. The questionnaire consisted of a total of 10 questions covering the outcomes of the present study.\n\nStatistical analysis\n\nThe analysis was performed using the intention-to-treat principle. As some of the variables had a skewed distribution, the results are reported as median (i.q.r.). Categorical variables are presented as frequencies with percentages, and were analysed using Fisher’s exact test. The Mann–Whitney U test was used to evaluate differences between mesh groups in the ordinal sf-IPQ and McCarthy pain scales. The primary outcome, sf-IPQ grade, was also analysed using generalized Wilcoxon–Mann–Whitney odds (WMW odds) 22 , 23 , providing data on the odds of shifting from one response level to the next as a function of mesh allocation. This analysis was also used to derive numbers needed to treat. A sensitivity analysis using ordinal regression was undertaken to evaluate the impact of adherence bias and chance confounding, using the following co-variables: age, BMI (less than 25, 25–30, or over 30 kg/m 2 ), hernia type (indirect, direct or combined), preoperative McCarthy pain score (0 to 150) and ASA grade (I, II or III). All tests were two-sided, and P < 0.050 was considered significant. For illustrative purposes, a box plot was used for the McCarthy pain scale distribution at follow-up.\n\nAccording to the power calculation for the original trial 16 , some 240 patients in total were needed to demonstrate a reduction in the proportion of patients reporting pain from 30 to 15 per cent, with 80 per cent statistical power. Before the questionnaires were sent out, it was assumed that this number of patients could be included and the present study was therefore considered feasible.\n\nData analysis was done in Stata ® release 15 (StataCorp, College Station, Texas, USA) and R version 3.6.3 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria).\n\nResults\n\nAll operations were performed during 2007–2009 with open anterior inguinal hernia repair according to Lichtenstein using local anaesthesia 24 . Some 320 of 363 patients from the earlier analysis were alive by the end of March 2018. Of these, 271 (84.9 per cent) consented to participate and returned questionnaires: 121 patients in the heavyweight mesh group and 150 in the lightweight mesh group ( Fig. 1 ). The questionnaire was answered between 19 April and 20 September 2018. There were more deaths during the postoperative follow-up in the heavyweight mesh group than in the lightweight mesh group (29 of 178 versus 14 of 185; P = 0.014).\n\nBaseline data collected in conjunction with the inclusion of patients in the original study are shown for the group participating in this follow-up study in Table 1 . Study groups were comparable concerning age, BMI, hernia type, ASA grade, and McCarthy preoperative pain score during normal activity. The lightweight mesh group included more patients on regular pain medication before surgery (8.0 versus 4.1 per cent). Operating time was slightly shorter in the heavyweight group, with a median of 68.5 (i.q.r. 60.0–80.0)) min, compared with 74.5 (61.5–90.0) min in the lightweight group.\n\nChronic pain\n\nThe impact of pain on daily activities was measured using the seven-grade sf-IPQ scale, and a statistically significant difference in favour of the lightweight mesh was evident ( P = 0.003) ( Table 2 ). In the heavyweight group, the proportion of patients who were pain-free was 89 of 121 (73.6 per cent) compared with 132 of 150 (88.0 per cent) in the lightweight group, whereas easily ignored pain was reported by 18 of 121 (14.9 per cent) and 8 of 150 (5.3 per cent) respectively. The proportion of patients with pain that could not be ignored but did not interfere with activities was 7 of 121 (5.8 per cent) and 5 of 150 (3.3 per cent) in the heavyweight and lightweight groups respectively.\n\nWith the lightweight group as the reference category, a generalized WMW odds of 1.33 (95 per cent c.i. 1.10 to 1.61; P = 0.004) was derived for a shift from a lower sf-IPQ category to the next higher with use of heavyweight mesh. This translated to a number needed to treat of 7.06 (95 per cent c.i. 4.28 to 21.44). In the ordinal regression sensitivity analysis, the results of unadjusted (odds ratio (OR) 2.63, 95 per cent c.i. 1.38 to 5.02) and adjusted (OR 2.41, 1.18 to 4.90) analyses were similar.\n\nThe McCarthy postoperative pain scale values were slightly higher in the heavyweight mesh group (112 patients) with a median value of 4 (95 per cent c.i. 3 to 5), compared with 3 (3 to 4) in the lightweight group (132 patients) ( Fig. 2 ). However, this trend did not reach statistical significance ( P = 0.099).\n\nGroin symptoms\n\nThere was a statistically significant difference regarding the perception of foreign material in the groin, favouring the lightweight mesh ( P = 0.006) ( Table 3 ). There were no significant differences in awareness of a groin lump, loss of sensation, or other pain and discomfort.\n\nSome 95.1 per cent of all patients rated their groin symptoms as better than before surgery, 4.5 per cent deemed that their symptoms were the same as before, whereas 0.4 per cent reckoned that the symptoms were worse. No significant differences could be discerned between the study groups ( Table 4 ).\n\nSome 83.0 per cent of all patients were completely satisfied with the surgery, 15.6 per cent were mostly satisfied, whereas 1.5 per cent were either mostly or completely unsatisfied. There was no statistically significant difference between the groups ( Table 5 ).\n\nRecurrence\n\nRates of patient-reported recurrence in the heavyweight and lightweight groups were 5.8 per cent (7 of 121) and 2.1 per cent (3 of 145) respectively. This difference was not statistically significant ( P = 0.193). According to the Swedish Hernia Register, reoperation was undertaken for only three recurrences in the cohort of 271 patients, two in the heavyweight group and one in the lightweight group; the latter was operated on using a polytetrafluoroethylene mesh that was not intended for the study, which constituted a protocol violation.\n\nDiscussion\n\nIn this long-term follow-up of an RCT comparing the use of heavyweight and lightweight mesh in open anterior inguinal hernia repair in adult men, there was a difference in pain affecting daily activities as well as in the perception of foreign material 9–12 years after surgery, favouring the lightweight mesh; this translated into a number needed to treat of 7.06 regarding chronic pain. However, there were no statistically significant differences between mesh groups in other groin symptoms, pain measured by the McCarthy pain scale, satisfaction or symptoms after operation compared with before surgery. Regardless of mesh type used, the great majority of patients experienced significant improvement in symptoms and satisfaction with the inguinal hernia repair. Only three patents underwent reoperation for hernia recurrence in the decade after inguinal hernia repair.\n\nThe strengths of this study include that it was an expertise-based RCT, minimizing the possibility of selection bias as well as bias related to surgeon experience. The operating techniques were standardized and the surgical performance was controlled at the start of the study. There was also an excellent response rate, with 84.7 per cent of patients returning questionnaires. Moreover, validated questionnaires were used along with modern statistical modelling, and sensitivity analyses were used to corroborate the trial findings.\n\nAlthough missing values were frequent in the study, every questionnaire item reached an response percentage exceeding 83 per cent. The variables with the highest degree of completeness were the first item of the sf-IPQ scale, as well as the questions on satisfaction and comparisons before and after surgery, all with rates rounding up to at least 99 per cent. The questions are simple and easy to understand, whereas more complicated questions might lead to omission of the question completely.\n\nThis study was carried out on men with a primary inguinal hernia. Therefore, no general conclusion can be made for other types of inguinal hernia and other patient groups, such as children and women. However, the authors believe the hypothesis that less foreign material in the wound causes less inflammation, and hence less chronic pain, should apply to most circumstances in which mesh is used for hernia repair. There is, however, a caveat regarding the relationship between pore size and mesh weight that necessitates comment; this trial was conducted in an era when heavier meshes also signified a smaller pore size, which is not always true with modern mesh types. Therefore, caution must be taken to not extrapolate the study findings to all types of heavyweight mesh.\n\nIn the original trial with short-term results 16 , there were statistically significant differences regarding awareness of a groin lump and discomfort in the groin 12 months after surgery. A decade after surgery the differences in these specific symptoms had levelled out and were no longer significant. There was no statistically significant difference in the rate of reoperation for hernia recurrence, although a few more patients in the heavyweight group reported subjective experiences of recurrence (5.8 versus 2.1 per cent); yet only two patients in this group underwent reoperation for recurrence. The high rate of subjective recurrences might be explained by the increased rates of foreign material and groin lump awareness; they did not represent true recurrences. Nevertheless, the present results are in line with those of previous studies 25 , 26 suggesting that lightweight meshes are as good as heavyweight meshes in preventing recurrence after open anterior mesh inguinal hernia repair, provided that an appropriate surgical technique is employed. A recent well conducted trial 27 of laparoscopic totally extraperitoneal repairs showed that a heavyweight mesh was superior to a lightweight mesh, both in terms of chronic pain and recurrence rates. Of importance, the trial allocation was blinded to both patient and investigator, minimizing a bias that might have influenced the results of the present trial. However, the laparoscopic extraperitoneal technique differs significantly from the open technique, particularly concerning mesh placement and fixation, questioning its comparability with studies using an open approach.\n\nThe sf-IPQ analysis provided evidence favouring the lightweight mesh in this trial, but this was not corroborated using the McCarthy pain scale. Both variables measure pain, although in a different manner. One can speculate that the discordance might be explained by the seeming difficulty patients had in responding to the McCarthy pain scale item, as the response rate was lower (99.3 versus 90.0 per cent) and some patients seemed to answer the question incorrectly. The authors suspect a common error at the lower end of the McCarthy scale, which indicates the absence of pain. Some patients seemed to have interpreted the location immediately above the centre of the sentence ‘no pain sensation’ to indicate the absence of pain. This gives a measure of 5–10 mm on the pain scale instead of the presumed 0 mm, whereas most patients were in fact pain-free. This is a likely source of non-differential misclassification in the McCarthy pain scale variable, probably causing bias towards the null. It is also of note that no differences between groups could be ascertained in the secondary comparison of groin symptoms before and after surgery; although this could be interpreted as contradicting the main result, the finding might be explained by the fact that this question was not validated formally and gives no measure of how much better the situation became after surgery, and also that a considerable time span had passed since the inguinal hernia repair.\n\nThe current trend in inguinal surgery in Sweden is the increasing use of lightweight meshes 28 , which is also recommended by the European Hernia Society guidelines 29 . The present findings further support this recommendation, when considering the long-term reductions in chronic pain.",
