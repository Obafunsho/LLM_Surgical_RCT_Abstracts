  "title": "Initial surgical experience with a dense cortical microarray in epileptic patients undergoing craniotomy for subdural electrode implantation",
  "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Detailed investigations of cortical physiology require the ability to record brain electrical activity at a submillimeter scale. Standard intracranial electrodes result in significant averaging of potentials generated by large numbers of neurons. In contrast, microelectrode arrays (MEA) allow for recording of local field potentials (LFPs) and single unit activity. We describe our initial surgical experience with the NeuroPort™ MEA in a series of patients undergoing subdural electrode implantation for epilepsy monitoring.\n\nTECHNIQUE: Seven patients were implanted with and underwent semichronic recording from the NeuroPort™ array during standard subdural electrode monitoring for epilepsy . The electrode was placed per company specifications in putative non-eloquent epileptogenic cortex. Following the monitoring period, MEAs were removed during explantation of subdural electrodes and resection of epileptogenic tissue.\n\nRESULTS: Successful implantation of the MEA was achieved in all patients with minor operative difficulties. Robust and durable LFPs and single-unit recordings were obtained from all implanted individuals. Implantation times ranged from 3–28 days; histological analysis of implanted tissue demonstrated no significant tissue injury or inflammatory response. There were no neurological complications or infections associated with electrode implantation or prolonged monitoring. Two patients developed post-resection issues with wound healing at the site of scalp egress, one requiring operative wound revision.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Our experience demonstrates that semi-chronic micro-EEG recording can be safely and effectively achieved using the NeuroPort™ microarray. Although significant tissue injury, infection or CSF leak were not encountered, the large profile of the connection pedestal resulted in suboptimal wound closure and healing in several patients. We predict that this problem will be easily addressed in second-generation devices.",
