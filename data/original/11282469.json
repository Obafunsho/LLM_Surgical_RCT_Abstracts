All subjects provided written informed consent.\n\nThe trial was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov ( NCT03021525 ) on January 16, 2017 and supervised by a data safety monitoring board. The statistical analysis plan was written and approved by the principal investigators and trial statisticians before data analysis. This trial is reported according to the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials statement. 16\n\nSubjects\n\nWe enrolled consenting adults scheduled for elective major open abdominal (i.e. visceral, urological, or gynaecological) surgery expected to last >2 h whom we expected to get >2 L of intravenous fluids and who had ≥10% risk of postoperative complications according to the American College of Surgery – National Surgical Quality Improvement Program risk calculator. 17 We excluded patients in whom laparoscopic surgery was planned; pregnant women; patients who had heart rhythms other than sinus rhythm, left ventricular ejection fraction <30%, aortic valve stenosis with an aortic valve area <1 cm 2 or mean gradient >40 mm Hg, pheochromocytoma, acute myocardial ischaemia within 30 days before randomisation, septic shock, anuric renal failure; and patients receiving palliative treatment. Inclusion was further restricted to patients in whom clinicians did not plan to use cardiac index monitoring. We excluded patients after randomisation who had surgery lasting <2 h or who were given <2 L of intravenous fluids.\n\nRandomisation and protocol\n\nWe previously published the trial protocol. 15 Basic anaesthetic management was per local routine. General anaesthesia was maintained with inhaled or intravenous anaesthetics. When clinically indicated, an epidural catheter was inserted before induction of general anaesthesia. Clinicians aimed to maintain mean arterial pressure >65 mm Hg, heart rate <100 beats min −1 , peripheral oxygen saturation >93% (by varying inspired oxygen fraction, tidal volumes within 6–8 ml kg −1 , and positive end-expiratory pressure 0–10 cm H 2 O), and body core temperature >36°C.\n\nSubjects were centrally randomised to cardiac index-guided therapy to maintain optimised postinduction cardiac index during and for the first 8 h after surgery (cardiac index-guided therapy) or to routine care in a 1:1 ratio using computer-generated codes.\n\nIn subjects assigned to cardiac index-guided therapy, cardiac index and pulse pressure variation were measured using internally calibrated pulse wave analysis (ProAQT; Pulsion Medical Systems, Feldkirchen, Germany). 18 , 19 , 20 We assumed that postinduction cardiac index was optimal when pulse pressure variation was <12% (treatment algorithm 1, Fig. 1 ). If pulse pressure variation was ≥12% after the induction of general anaesthesia, we gave fluids until pulse pressure variation was <12%, and then defined the respective cardiac index as ‘optimised postinduction cardiac index’. If pulse pressure variation was <12% after induction of general anaesthesia, we defined the respective cardiac index as ‘optimised postinduction cardiac index’. In either case, the minimum ‘optimised postinduction cardiac index’ we allowed was 2.5 L min −1 m −2 .\n\nClinicians were asked to maintain optimised postinduction cardiac index by giving dobutamine or 500 ml fluid boluses during surgery (treatment algorithm 2; Fig. 1 ), and, as practical, for the first 8 h after surgery. During the first 8 h after surgery, cardiac index-guided therapy was performed according to treatment algorithm 2 in subjects on controlled mechanical ventilation or according to treatment algorithm 3 in spontaneously breathing subjects ( Fig. 1 ). In subjects assigned to routine care, clinicians managed haemodynamics without cardiac index monitoring per local clinical routine. Subjects were blinded to group allocation before and during surgery. Clinicians and outcome assessors were not blinded to group allocation.\n\nOutcomes\n\nThe primary outcome was the incidence of a collapsed (any event vs none) composite outcome of complications within 28 days after surgery ( Supplementary Methods ). Complications included death and 22 complications as defined by the European Perioperative Clinical Outcome definitions. 21 We only considered complications if classified as moderate or severe. 21\n\nSecondary outcomes included the incidences of the composite outcome within 3 and 7 days after surgery; the individual incidences of each complication within 3, 7, and 28 days after surgery; the number of complications per subject within 3, 7, and 28 days after surgery; length of stay in the intensive care unit and in the hospital within 6 months after surgery; days alive within 6 months after surgery; and the incidence of death within 6 months after surgery.\n\nSubjects were followed during their hospital stay and up to 6 months after surgery. Postoperative outcomes were assessed by reviewing electronic medical records and telephone interviews.\n\nStatistical analysis\n\nCategorical data are presented as absolute number (percentage). Continuous data are presented as mean (standard deviation [ sd ]) or median (25th percentile–75th percentile). All statistical tests were performed two-sided at a 5% significance level. Confidence intervals (CIs) are presented as 95% two-sided. We calculated absolute standardised differences 22 to describe baseline imbalances between the two treatment groups, and considered factors with absolute standardised differences >0.2 as imbalanced. The primary and secondary outcomes were assessed in the modified intention-to-treat population, that is subjects who were randomised, had surgery lasting >120 min, and who were given >2 L of fluid.\n\nThe incidence of the composite primary outcome was compared between subjects assigned to cardiac index-guided therapy and subjects assigned to routine care using a binary logistic regression model with treatment group and centre as independent variables. A treatment-by-centre interaction was also included in the model. We report adjusted odds ratios with 95% CIs and P -values.\n\nAs a sensitivity analysis, the analysis was conducted adjusting for imbalanced baseline variables between groups. In two separate per-protocol analyses, we compared the incidence of the primary outcome between subjects assigned to routine care and subjects assigned to cardiac index-guided therapy in whom: (a) cardiac index was at or above the optimised postinduction cardiac index for ≥80% of the intervention period (i.e. during surgery and during the first 8 h after surgery); and (b) treatment algorithm 2 was correctly followed for ≥80% of the time during surgery ( Supplementary Methods ).\n\nSecondary outcomes were not adjusted for multiple analyses. Binary secondary outcomes are described using absolute and relative frequencies. The incidences of binary secondary outcomes were compared between subjects assigned to cardiac index-guided therapy and subjects assigned to routine care as for the primary outcome. For the individual incidences of each complication, statistical tests were restricted to complications within 28 days after surgery (owing to multiplicity) and to complications with at least two events per treatment group (owing to model computability). The other binary secondary outcomes are presented descriptively.\n\nCount secondary outcomes were analysed using negative binomial regression models with treatment group and centre as independent variables. Analyses were restricted to complications with at least two events. The interaction term was kept in the model if the P -value for treatment-by-centre interaction was <0.05. Observed and adjusted event rates for the treatment groups, and the adjusted incidence rate ratios with 95% CI and P- values for the group comparison, are presented either overall or separated by centre when interaction terms were kept in the model.\n\nThe secondary outcome ‘days alive within 6 months after surgery’ was analysed using a linear regression model with treatment group and centre as independent variables. The interaction term was kept in the model if the P -value for treatment-by-centre interaction was <0.05. Observed mean ( sd ) for the treatment groups, and the adjusted mean difference with 95% CI and P -value for the group comparison, are presented either overall or separated by centre when interaction terms were kept in the model.\n\nAnalyses were performed using R version 4.2.2 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria) or Stata 17 (StataCorp LLC, College Station, TX, USA).\n\nSample size estimate\n\nWe assumed that the composite primary outcome would occur in 48% of subjects assigned to routine care. 167 subjects per group ( n =334 in total) would provide 80% power for detecting an absolute reduction in the incidence of the composite primary outcome from 48% in subjects assigned to routine care to 33% in subjects assigned to cardiac index-guided therapy at a significance level of 5%. We planned to exclude the first two subjects in each centre a priori and to perform an interim analysis after recruitment of 50% of subjects. Allowing for 10% of subjects dropping out and excluding the first two subjects in each centre, we planned to enrol a total of 380 subjects (190 subjects per group).\n\nResults\n\nSubject enrolment and follow-up\n\nAs planned, we enrolled 380 subjects but excluded 16 before and 46 after randomisation ( Fig. 2 ; Supplementary Table S2 ). We thus finally analysed 318 subjects, 152 (48%) assigned to cardiac index-guided therapy and 166 (52%) assigned to routine care. Demographic and baseline characteristics were generally well-balanced between the two groups, but subjects assigned to cardiac index-guided therapy had a higher body weight and were more often receiving chronic antihypertensive medications ( Table 1 ). All subjects were followed up until 6 months after surgery.\n\nTrial treatment\n\nIn the 152 subjects assigned to cardiac index-guided therapy, the median optimised postinduction cardiac index was 2.6 (2.5–2.8) L min −1 m −2 and ranged from 2.5 L min −1 m −2 to 4.2 L min −1 m −2 ; 71 of these 152 (47%) subjects required fluids to achieve the optimised postinduction cardiac index (i.e. the cardiac index at which pulse pressure variation was <12%). The median amount of fluid subjects were given to achieve the optimised postinduction cardiac index was 500 (500–500) ml.\n\nA vasopressor was given to 135 of the 152 subjects (89%) assigned to cardiac index-guided therapy and to 141 of the 166 subjects (85%) assigned to routine care. Subjects assigned to cardiac index-guided therapy were given slightly more fluids than subjects assigned to routine care (median total amount of fluids: 4380 [3557–5789] ml vs 4000 [3200–5263] ml; Table 2 ). Dobutamine was given to 66 of the 152 subjects (43%) assigned to cardiac index-guided therapy, but to none of the subjects assigned to routine care.\n\nIn 120 of the 152 subjects (79%) assigned to cardiac index-guided therapy, cardiac index was at or above the optimised postinduction cardiac index for ≥80% of the intervention period. In 143 of the 152 subjects (94%), treatment algorithm 2 was correctly followed ≥80% of the time during surgery. Cardiac index-guided therapy was continued until 8 h after surgery in 122 of the 152 subjects (80%) assigned to cardiac index-guided therapy ( Supplementary Fig. S1 ).\n\nPrimary outcome\n\nThe composite primary outcome occurred in 84 of 152 subjects (55%) assigned to cardiac index-guided therapy and in 77 of 166 subjects (46%) assigned to routine care (odds ratio: 1.87, 95% CI: 1.03–3.39, P =0.038; Fig. 3 ; Supplementary Fig. S2 ). Adjusting for imbalanced baseline variables (body weight and chronic antihypertensive medications) resulted in an adjusted odds ratio of 1.84 (95% CI: 1.01–3.38, P =0.047).\n\nPer-protocol analyses confirmed the results of the primary outcome analysis in the modified intention-to-treat population. The composite primary outcome occurred in 67 of 120 subjects (56%) assigned to cardiac index-guided therapy in whom cardiac index was at or above the optimised postinduction cardiac index ≥80% of the intervention period (odds ratio: 1.79, 95% CI: 0.97–3.30, P =0.062) and in 79 of 143 subjects (55%) assigned to cardiac index-guided therapy in whom treatment algorithm 2 was correctly followed ≥80% of the time during surgery (odds ratio: 1.86, 95% CI: 1.03–3.39, P =0.041).\n\nSecondary outcomes\n\nThe individual incidences of each complication within 28 days after surgery are shown in Fig. 3 . The composite outcome occurred more frequently in subjects assigned to cardiac index-guided therapy than in subjects assigned to routine care both within 3 days after surgery (22% vs 17%) and within 7 days after surgery (37% vs 28%) ( Supplementary Table S1 ). Subjects assigned to cardiac index-guided therapy had more complications within 3, 7, and 28 days after surgery than subjects assigned to routine care ( Supplementary Table S1 ). At 6 months after surgery, 10 of the 152 subjects (7%) assigned to cardiac index-guided therapy and 21 of the 166 subjects (13%) assigned to routine care had died (odds ratio: 0.48, 95% CI: 0.22–1.05, P =0.065; Table 3 ; Supplementary Fig. S3 ).\n\nDiscussion\n\nContrary to our hypothesis, maintaining optimised postinduction cardiac index during and for the first 8 h after surgery did not reduce, and possibly increased, the incidence of a composite outcome of complications within 28 days after surgery compared with routine care in high-risk patients having elective major open abdominal surgery.\n\nThere are numerous previous trials on cardiac output-guided management in patients having noncardiac surgery. 6 , 7 , 8 , 23 It nevertheless remains controversial whether targeted perioperative cardiac output management improves postoperative outcomes. 8 The results of most multicentre trials are consistent with ours, and indicate that cardiac output-guided management does not improve outcomes in patients having noncardiac surgery. In a multicentre trial including 482 abdominal surgery patients, targeting fixed age-specific cardiac index values did not reduce major complications compared with routine care. 24 In the two largest trials so far, maximising stroke volume with fluid challenges after anaesthetic induction and maintaining this maximised postinduction stroke volume by giving fluids and a fixed low dose of an inotrope during major gastrointestinal surgery did not reduce the incidence of a composite outcome of 30-day postoperative complications and death in 734 patients (OPTIMISE 25 ) or the incidence of 30-day postoperative infectious complications in 2498 patients (OPTIMISE II 26 ; results presented at the EBPOM World Congress of Prehabilitation Medicine 2023 in London on July 6, 2023).\n\nWe assumed that postinduction cardiac index is optimal when patients are unlikely to be fluid responsive. We thus used pulse pressure variation to optimise postinduction cardiac index, and then maintained optimised cardiac index during and for the first 8 h after surgery. We chose to define optimised cardiac index after induction of general anaesthesia for two main reasons. Firstly, cardiac index is mainly determined by metabolic needs. 27 Energy expenditure after induction of general anaesthesia is about 25% lower than awake resting energy expenditure and reflects energy expenditure during abdominal surgery. 28 Secondly, defining cardiac index targets after induction of general anaesthesia allowed us to use pulse pressure variation that can predict fluid responsiveness only during controlled mechanical ventilation. 13 , 14 , 29\n\nProtocol adherence is crucial in trials of targeted haemodynamic management. Adherence was good in our trial. Cardiac index was sustained at or above the optimised postinduction cardiac index for ≥80% of the intervention period in 79% of subjects, and the treatment algorithm was correctly followed for ≥80% of the time during surgery in 94% of subjects. It is thus highly unlikely that better protocol adherence would have changed our findings. The question, then, is whether a different protocol might have produced favourable outcomes.\n\nUsing optimised postinduction cardiac index as intraoperative target might not have been the best approach. Anaesthetic induction agents can produce myocardial depression and vasodilation resulting in relative hypovolaemia. 30 , 31 , 32 Cardiac index measured just after induction of general anaesthesia might thus be particularly low and pulse pressure variation particularly high. Consistent with this, about half of the subjects required fluids to achieve the optimised postinduction cardiac index (i.e. to decrease pulse pressure variation to <12%).\n\nTargeting cardiac index measured before induction of anaesthesia might have been preferable intraoperatively, and likely would have been preferable postoperatively. Consistent with this assumption, maintaining preoperative resting cardiac index reduced major postoperative complications within 30 days after surgery compared with routine care in 188 high-risk patients having major abdominal surgery. 33 Additionally, as fluid responsiveness is not the same as the need for fluids, it might be better to simply define cardiac index targets without considering fluid responsiveness.\n\nOur results suggest that maintaining optimised postinduction cardiac index might increase the risk for postoperative complications, but potential underlying mechanisms remain speculative. The median total amount of fluids was only slightly higher in subjects assigned to cardiac index-guided therapy than in subjects assigned to routine care, and > 80% of subjects in each group were given vasopressors. Aside from potential differences in fluid timing, use of dobutamine was a main difference in the haemodynamic management between subjects assigned to cardiac index-guided therapy and subjects assigned to routine care. It remains unclear whether use of dobutamine was directly linked to complications.\n\nA limitation of our trial is that recruiting 380 subjects took 6 yr, in part because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Furthermore, we performed the trial in only five centres. Including more centres would presumably have sped up recruitment and improved external validity. Additionally, subjects were blinded to group allocation before and during surgery, but could have recognised group allocation in the postoperative period. Outcome assessors were not systematically blinded to group allocation. However, it is unlikely that not blinding outcome assessors introduced bias because we used objective outcomes and monitored outcome data. We measured cardiac index using internally calibrated pulse wave analysis, which can become unreliable when vasomotor tone is markedly altered or rapidly changes. 18 , 19 , 20 However, the specific pulse wave analysis system we used is validated in surgical patients. 34 Additionally, using pulse wave analysis reflects current clinical practice because it is the most commonly used method to measure cardiac index during surgery. 35 , 36 Finally, we only measured cardiac index in subjects assigned to cardiac index-guided therapy, but not in subjects assigned to routine care. Blinded cardiac index monitoring in subjects assigned to routine care would have allowed to determine if intraoperative cardiac index markedly differed between treatment groups.\n\nIn conclusion, maintaining optimised postinduction cardiac index during and for the first 8 h after surgery did not reduce, and possibly increased, the incidence of a composite outcome of complications within 28 days after surgery compared with routine care in high-risk patients having elective major open abdominal surgery. Clinicians should not strive to maintain optimised postinduction cardiac index during and after surgery in the expectation of reducing complications.\n\nAuthors’ contributions\n\nTrial conception and design: SF, SAH, DAR, BS\n\nData acquisition: GS, AB, PAN, GAC, SBE, ODC, FE, NGG, MH, GK, CK, AK, TM, VMG, AZ, MS, SAH\n\nData analysis and interpretation: all authors\n\nStatistical analysis: SL, AP\n\nDrafting of manuscript: SF, GS, AB, SL, DIS, DAR, BS\n\nCritical revision of manuscript for important intellectual content: all authors\n\nFinal approval of the version to be published: all authors\n\nAgreement to be accountable for all aspects of the work, thereby ensuring that questions related to the accuracy or integrity of any part of the work are appropriately investigated and resolved: all authors\n\nDeclarations of interest\n\nSF, GS, AB, PAN, GAC, SBE, FE, NGG, GK, CK, AK, TM, VMG, SL, AP, DIS, and SAH declare that they have no conflict of interest related to this trial.
