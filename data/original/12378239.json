The nation was designated an “aged society” in 2005, and the proportion of older adults is predicted to rise to 28% within the next decade, classifying Thailand as a “super-aged society” 1 . Similarly, the global population of individuals aged 60 years and older reached 1 billion in 2009; it is projected to grow to 1.4 billion by 2030 and 2.1 billion by 2050 1 , 2 . The COVID-19 pandemic has further affected older adults by limiting daily activities, increasing time spent at home, and reducing physical contact with others, which has contributed to fewer hospital follow-up visits.\n\nCognitive changes among older patients have been recognized for over a century. Multiple studies have investigated postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD), defined as a decline in cognitive performance after the restoration of consciousness 3 , 4 . Cognitive impairment in older adults ranges from normal aging to subjective cognitive impairment (self-reported cognitive complaints with normal screening results), mild cognitive impairment, and dementia 5 .However, the pathogenesis of POCD is complex and multifactorial. The proper functioning of the central nervous system relies on adequate oxygenation, nutrient supply, efficient waste clearance, and neurochemical balance. Disruptions in any of these systems may lead to global dysfunction, contributing to the development of POCD 6 .\n\nOne major factor is neuroinflammation. Inflammatory responses within the central nervous system have been strongly associated with the onset and progression of POCD 7 . Hypocapnia and cerebral vasoconstriction, often caused by intraoperative hyperventilation, may also play a role. Wollman et al. reported that intraoperative hypocarbia was linked to prolonged cognitive impairment lasting at least 3–6 days post-hyperventilation 8 . Another potential cause is perioperative hypotension, which can reduce cerebral blood flow. However, findings from the ISPOCD1 study indicated that hypotension was not significantly associated with long-term POCD 9 . Cerebral microemboli, such as clots, fat, or air bubbles during cardiopulmonary bypass, may cause subtle cognitive decline. Diffusion-weighted MRI has demonstrated new ischemic lesions in approximately 50% of patients after such procedures 10 .\n\nFinally, systemic inflammation appears to play a major role. Hudetz et al. found that elevated postoperative levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6) and C-reactive protein (CRP) were associated with cognitive impairment following coronary artery surgery 11 . Surgical trauma can trigger systemic inflammatory responses through the release of proinflammatory mediators, including endotoxins and cytokines such as IL-6 and IL-8 12 . This inflammatory response may partly explain how peripheral surgical trauma contributes to cognitive decline after surgery. A recent randomized controlled trial by Glumac et al. investigated the effect of prophylactic dexamethasone in patients undergoing elective cardiac surgery. Patients who received dexamethasone showed a statistically significant reduction in the incidence of POCD, systemic inflammatory response syndrome, and postoperative C-reactive protein levels compared to the placebo group. These findings suggest that preoperative administration of dexamethasone may attenuate the inflammatory response and reduce the risk of early POCD following cardiac surgery 13 .\n\nPOCD is characterized by a measurable drop in performance across multiple cognitive domains evaluated before and after surgery 3 , 4 . It can persist for 3 months to as long as 7.5 years postoperatively 9 , 14 . POCD has also been associated with reduced quality of life 15 , 16 , early departure from the workforce, and increased mortality 17 – 19 .\n\nPostoperative assessments typically occur after the acute effects of surgery and anesthesia have subsided, usually around 1 week after surgery 3 , 20 . The 3-month postoperative period is often considered an appropriate time for cognitive testing, as it has been associated with further cognitive decline 21 . However, there is no consensus on diagnostic cutoffs for POCD; proposed thresholds range from 1 standard deviation (SD) to 1.5 SD or 2 SD below baseline 3 , 20 .\n\nSome studies report a smaller subset of patients (4.2%‒8.7% at 1 week and 5.0%‒7.8% at 3 months) who actually show cognitive improvement after surgery and anesthesia 17 . This improvement may result from enhanced overall health and improved quality of life 22 .\n\nEstablished risk factors for POCD include advanced age 9 , 18 , 23 prolonged anesthesia 9 , lower educational levels 9 , 18 , diabetes 23 , and a history of cerebrovascular events without residual impairment 18 . Certain drugs, such as dexmedetomidine and midazolam 24 , and inhalation agents (e.g., sevoflurane and isoflurane) 25 rather than propofol, have also been implicated. Furthermore, postoperative delirium correlates with cognitive decline at 1 month 26 . Notably, it appears more prevalent in patients without preexisting mild cognitive impairment than in those who already have some cognitive impairment 19 .\n\nStandardized neurological tests are commonly used to detect cognitive decline and improvement by comparing preoperative and postoperative performance. The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and the Mini-Mental State Examination are two widely used screening tools 27 . The MoCA, recognized for its high sensitivity and specificity in identifying mild cognitive impairment 28 , assesses 6 cognitive domains: memory, executive functioning, attention, language, visuospatial abilities, and orientation. Each domain corresponds to distinct neuroanatomical regions 29 . We adopted our hospital’s newly developed “Auto-MoCA” application, an online version of the MoCA, which enables patients to independently complete the MoCA test on their personal communication devices 30 .\n\nThe primary aim of this study was to determine the incidence of POCD using the Auto-MoCA application at 1 week after surgery. The secondary objectives were to compare characteristics and outcomes of patients with and without POCD at 1 week and to examine specific cognitive domains in patients who demonstrated cognitive improvement at 3 months.\n\nMethods\n\nThis prospective, descriptive study was conducted at a university hospital in Bangkok, Thailand, as part of a POCD web-application cohort project. The data collection process was between March and October, 2024. The project was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the Faculty of Medicine Siriraj Hospital, Mahidol University (reference: Si 750/2022). The study protocol followed the Declaration of Helsinki and its later amendments, and all patients provided informed consent. We enrolled Thai-speaking patients aged 60 years or older who were scheduled for major elective surgery under anesthesia (i.e., general anesthesia, regional anesthesia and combined anesthetic techniques) and owned compatible devices (e.g., mobile phones or tablets) that could be used to access the Auto-MoCA application. Eligible procedures included orthopedic, cardiovascular-thoracic, colorectal, hepatobiliary, gynecological, and urological surgeries. Patients were excluded if they declined participation, lacked suitable devices, could not complete the cognitive assessment (e.g., were unable to understand Thai or had severe visual or auditory impairments), or had preexisting brain pathology. We also excluded individuals deemed unsuitable for postoperative follow-up.\n\nCognitive assessment tools\n\nCognitive performance was evaluated via the Auto-MoCA application before surgery and at 1 week and 3 months post-surgery. Results were transmitted through an online application and assessed by a psychologist.\n\nAuto-Montreal cognitive assessment tool (Auto-MoCA)\n\nWe used the web-based Auto-MoCA 30 , a newly developed version of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), adapted from the original tool. In this version, patients received a personalized link to access the test during each follow-up period. The test interface, including instructions and content, was presented in Thai, with animated videos of a virtual doctor guiding patients through each step. Patients received guidance from an enrollment team (comprising physicians, a nurse, a psychologist, and research assistants) during their first Auto-MoCA session.\n\nThe Auto-MoCA assesses eight cognitive domains: (1) visuospatial/executive (trail-making, cube copy, and clock drawing), (2) naming, (3) memory, (4) attention (target detection, digits forward/backward, and serial subtraction), (5) language (sentence repetition and verbal fluency), (6) abstraction, (7) delayed recall, and (8) orientation.\n\nFor the visuospatial tasks (e.g., trail-making, cube copy, and clock drawing), patients used their finger or a stylus to draw directly on the device. During the target detection task, they tapped the screen in response to visual cues. For other sections, such as language and memory, patient responses were recorded via audio and later reviewed and scored by a trained psychologist.\n\nTotal scores range from 0 to 30, with ≥ 25 suggesting normal cognition 31 . Baseline assessments were performed 1 day before surgery, followed by evaluations at 1 week and 3 months afterward.\n\nConfusion assessment method for the intensive care unit\n\nThe Confusion Assessment Method for the Intensive Care Unit is a brief delirium assessment adapted from the original Confusion Assessment Method. It evaluates 4 key criteria—acute onset or fluctuating course, inattention, altered level of consciousness, and disorganized thinking. A patient is considered positive if both major criteria (acute or fluctuating onset plus inattention) and at least one minor criterion (disorganized thinking or altered consciousness) are present 32 .\n\n4 “A”s Test .\n\nThe 4 “A”s Test rapidly detects delirium and cognitive impairment. It assesses: (1) alertness, (2) the Abbreviated Mental Test 4, (3) the reciting of the months of the year backward, and (4) the presence of acute changes or fluctuations in mental status 33 . Item 1 is scored 0 for normal alertness or 4 for altered alertness. Items 2 and 3 are each scored from 0 to 2 based on accuracy. Item 4 is scored 0 if no acute change is present and 4 if there is a clear change. Total scores range from 0 to 12, with 0 indicating no impairment, 1‒3 suggesting cognitive impairment, and ≥ 4 indicating delirium 34 .\n\nModified informant questionnaire on cognitive decline in the elderly\n\nThis instrument assesses cognitive impairment severity in patients with suspected Alzheimer’s disease 36 . It focuses on changes in cognitive function over the past 10 years. A cutoff score of 3.42 was used because it demonstrates acceptable sensitivity and specificity for dementia screening 37 .\n\nFunctional assessment tools\n\nBarthel activities of daily living index\n\nThe Thai version of the questionnaire for the Barthel Activities of Daily Living (BADL) index 38 contains 10 items: feeding, transferring (wheelchair to bed and back), personal toileting, mobility, bathing, walking on a level surface, ascending and descending stairs, dressing, and bowel and bladder control. Each item is scored in increments of 0, 5, 10, or 15, for a maximum possible total of 100. Higher scores reflect greater independence, whereas a score of 0 indicates complete dependence 39 .\n\nLawton‒Brody instrumental activities of daily living scale\n\nThe Lawton‒Brody Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADL) scale is used to assess independent living skills in older adults. The Thai version has demonstrated acceptable linguistic, content, and face validity 40 . The scale comprises 8 tasks: (1) telephone use, (2) shopping, (3) food preparation, (4) housekeeping, (5) laundry, (6) mode of transportation, (7) medication management, and (8) financial management 41 . Each task is scored as 0 or 1, yielding a total possible score of 8. A total of 8 indicates full independence for women, while a score of 5 (excluding housekeeping, laundry, and food preparation) indicates the same for men 42 .\n\nFatigue, resistance, ambulation, illnesses, and loss of weight scale\n\nThe Fatigue, Resistance, Ambulation, Illnesses, and Loss of Weight (FRAIL) scale identifies individuals at risk for frailty. It consists of 5 items: (1) fatigue, (2) resistance (ability to climb 1 flight of stairs), (3) ambulation (ability to walk 1 block), (4) number of illnesses (≥ 5), and (5) weight loss (> 5% in 1 year). Each item scores 1 if present, and a total score of 3 to 5 indicates frailty 43 .\n\nHealth-related quality of life tool\n\nThai EuroQol 5-Dimension 5-Level questionnaire\n\nQuality of life was assessed using the Thai version of the EuroQol 5-Dimension 5-Level (EQ-5D-5 L) questionnaire. The coefficients for each factor were based on a study by Pattanaphesaj et al. 44 . We used the first part of the EQ-5D-5 L questionnaire to evaluate 5 dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities (e.g., work and daily tasks), pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. Each dimension is scored from 1 to 5, with 1 indicating no problem and 5 indicating extreme problems.\n\nProcedure\n\nParticipants were selected from the department’s website for screening and were enrolled by the research team 1 day before surgery in their wards. They were given a detailed explanation of the study and gave written informed consent. After enrollment, participants registered on the POCD online platform and completed a self-reported form that encompassed demographic information (age, sex, body mass index, educational level, comorbidities, medications and underlying indications for surgery (e.g., non-malignancy diseases, malignancy, trauma and arthritic conditions)). Preoperatively, the participants also filled out questionnaires for the BADL index, the IADL scale, the FRAIL scale, and the EQ-5D-5 L to enable their quality of life to be evaluated. Baseline cognitive function was then assessed via the Auto-MoCA application.\n\nOn postoperative days 1 to 3, delirium was screened using either the Confusion Assessment Method for the Intensive Care Unit for patients in the intensive care unit, or the 4 “A”s Test for ward patients. Most postoperative assessments were conducted remotely through the POCD online platform. Scores for the BADL index, IADL scale, and EQ-5D-5L questionnaire were redetermined at 1 week and 3 months post-surgery. Preoperative data from medical records comprised the surgical site, anemia status, serum sodium, and the American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status class. Intraoperative data consisted of inhalation anesthetic use, anesthesia technique, blood loss, transfusions, hypotensive or desaturation events, and surgery duration. Postoperative data were delirium incidence, hospital length of stay, and in-hospital mortality.\n\nOutcome assessments\n\nThe primary outcome was the incidence of POCD at 1 week. Based on the previous validation study by Tangwongchai et al. in the general Thai population reported that the SD of the MoCA was 2.14 31 . Therefore, we defined POCD as a decrease of 2 or more points in the postoperative MoCA score. The secondary outcomes were comparisons of the characteristics and outcomes of patients with and without POCD at 1 week and an investigation of specific cognitive domains in POCD patients who demonstrated improvement at 3 months. In-hospital outcomes included delirium (assessed by the Confusion Assessment Method for the Intensive Care Unit), hospital length of stay, and in-hospital mortality. Follow-up at 1 week and 3 months included reassessments of functional status (via the BADL index and the IADL scale) and health-related quality of life (measured by the EQ-5D-5 L questionnaire), along with mortality data.\n\nStatistical analysis\n\nThe sample size was calculated using data from a previous study by Somnuke et al. 19 , which reported a 23% incidence of POCD by paper-based evaluation. We hypothesized that a web-based assessment would yield a 40% incidence. With a 2-sided 95% confidence interval, an expected 40% impairment, and a 9% error, the required sample size was 114 patients. Allowing for a 25% dropout rate, we set the final sample size at 159 patients.\n\nDescriptive statistics were employed to summarize demographic and clinical variables. Normally distributed continuous data are presented as means with standard deviations, while nonnormally distributed data are shown as medians (interquartile ranges). Categorical variables are expressed as frequencies (percentages). Group comparisons between POCD and no POCD were performed using either the independent t -test or the Mann‒Whitney U test for continuous variables, and the chi-square or Fisher’s exact test for categorical variables. Logistic regression analysis identified factors associated with POCD at 1 week. Variables with a P value < 0.20 in univariate analysis were included in the final multivariate logistic regression model using the enter method. Results were reported as adjusted odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals.\n\nAll statistical analyses were conducted using IBM SPSS Statistics, version 28 (IBM Corp, Armonk, NY, USA). P values were two-sided, and a P value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.\n\nResults\n\nDemographic data\n\nA total of 169 older patients scheduled for major elective surgery between April and December 2024 were initially enrolled. After excluding 10 individuals for incomplete data, 159 patients completed the preoperative assessment. Additional exclusions for loss to follow-up at 1 week, postponed procedures, duplication with another study, or death yielded a final cohort of 111 patients (Fig. 1 ). The mean age was approximately 70 years, and most participants (88.3%) had more than 6 years of education. The study population was predominantly female. Dyslipidemia (55.9%), hypertension (45.0%), and cancer (34.2%) were the most frequent comorbidities. More than half of the cohort (69.4%) was classified as American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status class I or II, and the 3 primary surgical categories were orthopedic, intra-abdominal, and intrathoracic procedures. Among these, orthopedic surgeries were most commonly performed for underlying arthritic conditions such as osteoarthritis, spinal stenosis, and spondylolisthesis. In the subgroup of patients with cancer-related surgeries ( n = 33), POCD was observed in 12 patients (36.4%).\n\nFrailty was observed in 12.6% of patients, and 35.1% showed impaired ability to perform instrumental activities of daily living. The Modified Informant Questionnaire on Cognitive Decline in the Elderly indicated a positive risk for dementia in 9.9% of the sample. Preoperatively, 33.3% had anemia and 7.2% had hyponatremia. The mean preoperative MoCA score was 21.5 ± 4.2.\n\nPrimary outcome: POCD incidence at 1 week\n\nAt the 1-week follow-up, 111 patients completed the MoCA test. POCD was observed in 45 patients (40.5%), with a mean MoCA score of 18.6 ± 3.7. The demographic characteristics of patients with and without POCD were similar across multiple factors, including age, sex, education level, preexisting dementia, hyponatremia, warfarin use, anemia, American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status, frailty, and scores for the BADL index and the IADL scale. However, patients with cardiovascular conditions (e.g., atrial flutter, atrial fibrillation, valvular heart disease, or cardiac arrhythmias) had a significantly higher incidence of POCD at 1 week (Table 1 ).\n\nSecondary outcomes\n\nIntraoperative factors, including operative time, blood transfusion, surgical site, inhalation agents, anesthesia techniques, benzodiazepine use, blood loss, desaturation, and hypotension, did not differ significantly between the 2 groups. Postoperative factors, such as the incidence of postoperative delirium and hospital length of stay, also showed no significant differences (Table 2 ). In-hospital outcomes, functional status, and quality-of-life assessments at 1 week and 3 months were similarly comparable (Table 2 ). According to the multivariate analysis of age, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes mellitus, IADL score and preoperative mild cognitive impairment, only cardiovascular diseases was identified as a significant risk factor (Table 3 ).\n\nRegarding the MoCA domains, patients who developed POCD showed significant declines in visuospatial ( P < 0.001), attention ( P < 0.001), language ( P < 0.001), abstraction ( P = 0.014), and orientation ( P < 0.001) skills (Supplementary Table 1).\n\nAt 3 months, 85 patients repeated the Auto-MoCA test. Of these, 34 (40.0%) had developed POCD compared to their baseline results, with generalized declines in visuospatial ( P < 0.001), naming ( P = 0.026), attention ( P < 0.001), language ( P = 0.002), abstraction ( P = 0.002), and orientation ( P = 0.004) domains. However, delayed recall remained largely unaffected (Supplementary Table 2).\n\nThe mean MoCA scores at the 3 timepoints were generally similar. However, a slight decline occurred at 1 week, indicated by a downward shift in the 95% confidence interval. By 3 months, scores returned close to preoperative levels, suggesting cognitive recovery (Fig. 2 a). Patients with cardiovascular disease had higher baseline MoCA scores but experienced a sharper 1-week decline, followed by improvement near baseline by 3 months (Fig. 2 b). Although most participants were female, male patients showed higher baseline MoCA scores with a smaller initial drop and more robust recovery at 3 months (Fig. 2 c). Moreover, in a subgroup analysis of 13 understudied Thai patients, defined as having fewer than six years of education, 11 individuals (84.6%) had preexisting mild cognitive impairment. The average preoperative MoCA score in this group was 17.46 ± 4.9, which slightly declined to 17.23 ± 4.4 at 1 week postoperatively. Despite this, only 3 patients (23.1%) developed early POCD at the 1-week assessment.\n\nAmong the 45 patients who experienced POCD at 1 week, 35 completed the Auto-MoCA assessment at 3 months. Of these, 15 (42.9%) demonstrated cognitive improvement, defined as an increase of ≥ 2 points in the MoCA score. Improvements in visuospatial, attention, and delayed recall domains contributed most to this recovery (Table 4 ).\n\nDiscussion\n\nOur cohort study found that about 40% of older patients undergoing surgery and anesthesia developed POCD, defined by a decrease in the Auto-MoCA score. Preoperative cardiovascular disease was associated with more severe cognitive impairment than in those without such conditions 45 .\n\nThe Rotterdam study reported that patients with atrial fibrillation carry more than twice the risk of developing dementia compared to those without atrial fibrillation 46 . In older adults, atrial fibrillation often stems from ischemic heart disease, hypertension, rheumatic heart disease, or thyroid disorders 45 . Proposed mechanisms include silent cerebral infarcts in subcortical white matter, microbleeds, cerebral hypoperfusion 35 , and atherosclerosis 47 . Structural brain changes may also play a role in POCD, with studies noting reduced hippocampal volume 48 , greater preoperative leukoaraiosis or lacunae 49 , and decreased gray matter in the thalamus 50 . These findings suggest that preexisting neuroanatomical vulnerabilities may heighten the risk of POCD.\n\nAl-Kaisey et al. reported that POCD at 3 months was significantly lower in patients with atrial fibrillation receiving medical therapy than in those who underwent catheter ablation 51 . Early POCD at 48 h post-procedure occurred in 13.7% of patients with atrial fibrillation who underwent catheter ablation 52 . By 6 months, POCD appeared reversible in most of these patients, and at 12 months they showed significant cognitive improvement, suggesting a potential for recovery over time 51 .\n\nIn the intraoperative setting, our study observed no significant differences between POCD and non-POCD patients regarding anesthetic technique, operative duration, inhalation agent use, blood loss, blood transfusion, or intraoperative hypotension and desaturation. Postoperatively, delirium, hospital length of stay, and mortality were also similar between the groups (Table 2 ). Some studies have noted an association between delirium and POCD 26 , 53 , 54 , but our incidence of delirium was relatively low. This discrepancy may reflect our younger average patient age or limited sample size, which could reduce statistical power. Although delirium was not identified as a risk factor for POCD in this cohort, caution is warranted when interpreting this finding, because underreporting or insufficient power could have influenced the results.\n\nWe assessed patients’ postoperative functional status at baseline, 1 week, 1 month, and 3 months after surgery. Changes in functional status were evaluated using preoperative and 3-month data; however, no significant differences emerged in either group. Monk et al. found that lower preoperative IADL scores predicted a higher risk of late POCD 18 . Other studies have also indicated that patients with POCD are more likely to develop new IADL impairments than those without POCD, placing them at greater risk for postoperative disability 55 and reduced quality of life 56 .\n\nOur study demonstrated significant changes in MoCA scores following major elective surgery. At 1 week, patients with POCD showed broad declines in visuospatial, attention, language, abstraction, and orientation domains. This pattern suggests that the early postoperative period may selectively impair certain cognitive domains while sparing others. However, the precise pattern of cognitive changes remains unclear when compared with prior reports 19 , 57 .\n\nBy 3 months, fewer patients showed persistent declines in MoCA scores compared to their preoperative baseline, with significant deficits in all domains except delayed recall. This pattern suggests that POCD can persist beyond early recovery, while delayed recall appears relatively preserved.\n\nNotably, more than two-fifths of patients who met the criteria for POCD at 1 week improved by 3 months. This finding aligns with prior research indicating that cognitive recovery may occur over time 26 , 51 , 52 . Improvements in visuospatial, attention, and delayed recall domains contributed to recovery in the late postoperative period.\n\nOverall, our results underscore the importance of cognitive monitoring and targeted interventions in older surgical patients. Recent studies have found that cognitive training can help prevent POCD 58 . We recommend that future interventional research should be conducted aiming to enhance recovery and improve the quality of life among elderly patients undergoing major surgery.\n\nLimitations\n\nOur study has several limitations. First, the web-based platform for online follow-ups and evaluations was not entirely suitable for older adults, and minor inconsistencies or technical issues might have caused variations in scoring. To mitigate these problems, we incorporated a guided walkthrough before surgery and required voice recordings for specific Auto-MoCA tasks to confirm that participants completed the test themselves.\n\nAlthough we designed a user-friendly application and provided a guided walkthrough preoperatively, many participants reported difficulties using the system. Consequently, a substantial number were lost to follow-up or withdrew from the study.\n\nSecond, the validation of the Auto-MoCA test. Auto-MoCA is a newly developed, web-based cognitive assessment tool. While formal validation is currently underway in a separate ongoing study, the results have not yet been published. To ensure accuracy in this study, all patient recordings and responses from the Auto-MoCA were reviewed and scored by a trained psychologist, providing an additional layer of expert validation despite the tool’s preliminary status.\n\nThird, the variability in surgical procedures and anesthesia techniques may have introduced confounding effects, as different types of surgery and anesthetic approaches are associated with varying levels of POCD risk. Future studies with stratified analyses or more homogenous surgical populations are needed to better isolate the effects of specific procedures and anesthetic methods on POCD incidence.\n\nDespite these constraints, our study has notable strengths. We used the Auto-MoCA application as a web-based follow-up tool, and all MoCA evaluations were performed by a psychologist, ensuring standardized scoring. Although the web-based platform posed challenges, it marks progress toward continuous, remote communication with patients. With further refinements, such applications could improve postoperative follow-ups, consultations, and cognitive training programs, ultimately benefiting patient outcomes and quality of life. We also analyzed changes in Auto-MoCA scores across different cognitive domains over multiple timepoints, yielding deeper insights into postoperative cognitive trajectories. Finally, we examined patients who displayed cognitive recovery in the late postoperative period, an area often overlooked in cognitive research.\n\nConclusions\n\nThis prospective cohort study found that POCD affected approximately 40% of older Thai patients undergoing major elective surgery. The incidence was significantly higher among those with preexisting cardiovascular conditions. Cognitive decline was most evident at 1 week postoperatively, particularly in the visuospatial, attention, language, abstraction, and orientation domains. Although most intraoperative and postoperative variables were not associated with POCD, cardiovascular comorbidities emerged as a strong risk factor. Importantly, over 40% of patients who developed early POCD showed cognitive improvement by 3 months, with notable gains in visuospatial, attention, and delayed recall functions. These findings underscore the need for postoperative cognitive monitoring and targeted interventions. Future interventional research should be conducted to further explore the patients who demonstrated cognitive recovery aiming to enhance cognitive outcomes in older surgical patients.\n\nSupplementary Information\n\nBelow is the link to the electronic supplementary material.\n\nSupplementary Material 1",
