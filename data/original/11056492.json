  "full_text": "Materials and Methods\n\nStudy Design\n\nThe Bilateral Remote Ischemic Conditioning in Children trial was a double-blind, prospective, parallel group, randomized controlled trial in young children undergoing elective cardiac surgery at 2 centers in the United Kingdom: Birmingham Children's Hospital and Leeds Children's Hospital ( Figure 1 ). The study was approved by the West Midlands-Solihull NHS Research Ethics Committee (16/WM/0309, August 5, 2016). The published trial protocol provides a detailed description of the trial and methods, including patient and public involvement. 17\n\nPatients\n\nAll infants and young children, aged 3 months to 3 years at the time of surgery, undergoing complete repair of tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) or surgical closure of a ventricular septal defect (VSD), with or without concomitant atrial septal defect closure or pulmonary artery repair/augmentation, were eligible. Children were excluded if they required an additional procedure (other than atrial septal defect closure or pulmonary artery repair/augmentation); had significant airway or parenchymal lung disease, bleeding disorder, or a recent ischemic event; had undergone previous cardiac surgery with cardioplegic arrest; required emergency surgery; or their parents declined to give consent. As in previous trials, 6 , 12 those with a known major chromosomal defect were also initially excluded, but this was amended during the trial because there was no biological reason for exclusion. Eligible patients were identified from multidisciplinary team meetings, clinics, or surgical waiting lists. A parent information sheet was provided, in person or via post, and parental written informed consent for publication obtained by a consultant surgeon before enrollment.\n\nRandomization and Blinding\n\nOn the day of surgery, participants were randomized (1:1) to receive RIPC or a sham procedure (control) using a secure online randomization system with a minimization algorithm incorporating (1) congenital heart defect, (2) presence of a right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT) stent in those with TOF, and (3) surgical center.\n\nThe trial intervention was delivered by an independent healthcare professional trained and competent in its delivery according to a standard operating procedure, who also performed the randomization and was not involved in postoperative care. Blinding was maintained by covering the child with a surgical drape throughout cuff application, intervention, and removal. The research nurse and clinical teams involved in the child's care were blinded to group allocation throughout the trial.\n\nProcedures\n\nAfter induction of anesthesia but before sternotomy, the treatment group received RIPC in both lower limbs simultaneously using the PTSii digital tourniquet system (Delfi Medical Innovations) inflated to 50 mm Hg or greater above systolic pressure for 3 cycles of 5 minutes ischemia and 5 minutes reperfusion 18 ; if 1 lower limb was unavailable, the cuff was placed on the upper arm. Continual loss of arterial flow during ischemia was confirmed by concealed distal pulse oximetry. 10 Once the intervention had begun, each cuff was kept on the same limb to ensure repeated doses of ischemia-reperfusion to the same muscle mass. In the control group, cuffs were applied to a plastic tubing dummy limb placed between the participant's legs and 3 sham inflation-deflation cycles performed, covered by a drape before, during, and after the sham intervention to maintain blinding. Adherence to intervention was defined as receiving the allocated intervention, with documented loss of arterial flow during each ischemic phase in the RIPC group.\n\nAll other aspects of anesthesia, surgery, perfusion, and postoperative care were at the sole discretion of the blinded clinical team, except for propofol, which was not used for induction or maintenance of anesthesia, with isoflurane as the preferred volatile anesthetic. 19 St Thomas' cardioplegia was used at both sites and delivered according to local practice. Myocardial reperfusion on first release of the aortic crossclamp was considered as time zero for postoperative events. Blood was drawn before sternotomy and at 3, 6, 12, and 24 hours after reperfusion, and plasma high-sensitivity (hs) troponin-T concentrations were quantified in batches using the fifth-generation Elecsys Tn-T HS assay (Roche) at an approved core laboratory.\n\nRight atrial biopsies were obtained soon after aortic crossclamping (onset ischemia) and just before its release (late ischemia) for metabolic phenotyping. Briefly, tissue extracts were analyzed using ultra high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Two complementary assays were applied: HILIC assay for water-soluble metabolites and C 18 reversed-phase assay for lipids. The impact of RIPC on myocardial metabolism was assessed through robust statistical analysis using correction for multiple testing and pathway enrichment analysis ( Supplementary Methods ).\n\nOutcomes\n\nThe primary outcome was area under the curve (AUC) for plasma hs-troponin-T in the first 24 hours after aortic crossclamp release (reperfusion) as a biomarker of myocardial injury. Secondary outcomes were peak hs-troponin-T in the first 12 hours; total vasoactive inotrope score in the first 12 hours 20 ; arterial lactate and central venous oxygen saturations in the first 12 hours; length of postoperative stay in intensive care unit (ICU); and length of postoperative stay in hospital. Cardiac index was measured using ICON (Osypka Medical) as an exploratory outcome in Birmingham only ( Supplemental Methods ).\n\nThe following serious adverse events were reported to the sponsor within 48 hours of identification: death; extracorporeal life support; major neurological event; and further surgery or catheter intervention in the early postoperative period. Follow-up was until discharge from hospital or 30 days, whichever was sooner.\n\nSample Size\n\nWe hypothesized that RIPC would reduce AUC for hs-troponin-T in the first 24 hours compared with controls, but that exposure to chronic hypoxemia may impact this reduction. Based on limited published data using a standard (fourth-generation) troponin assay, the proposed sample size was sufficient to detect a 35% reduction in postoperative AUC troponin, assuming a mean release equivalent to 350 μg/L/h in the control group compared with 228 μg/L/h in the RIPC group (extrapolated from the similarly mixed cohort of cyanotic and acyanotic children 6 ), with a variability of 220 μg/L/h 9 A sample size of at least 52 children per treatment group was needed to have a power of 80% and a significance level of .05 (2-sided). We aimed to recruit up to 120 children to allow for dropouts, randomized in a 1:1 ratio between RIPC and control.\n\nStatistical Analysis\n\nPrimary analysis of the primary and secondary outcome measures was performed according to the intention-to-treat principle. Analyses were undertaken using SAS v9.4. The primary comparison compared the RIPC group with the control group, and all estimates of differences are presented with 95% CIs.\n\nTo calculate the primary outcome, AUC for hs-troponin-T in the first 24 hours, data were collected at baseline (presternotomy) and at 3, 6, 12, and 24 hours after reperfusion. The AUC was calculated for each participant using the trapezoidal method and compared between groups using a linear regression model, adjusting for the minimization variables (congenital heart defect, center) and baseline troponin. Missing baseline troponin values were imputed using the median value of the participant's randomized group and type of defect, whereas any missing postoperative value led to exclusion from the primary analysis. Participants who received their randomized treatment, including those with incomplete postoperative troponin data, were included in the per-protocol analysis. Subgroup analyses were performed for the primary outcome only to assess whether the treatment effect differed by preoperative oxygen saturations (cyanotic < 90% or acyanotic ≥ 90%); congenital heart defect (TOF with RVOT stent, TOF without RVOT stent, or VSD); and age (<1 year or ≥1 year).\n\nFor the secondary outcomes, continuous data items were analyzed using a linear regression model. Continuous outcomes measured across more than 3 time points were analyzed using mixed-effect repeated-measures models. Time to event outcomes were analyzed using a Cox regression model. P values are reported from 2-sided tests. The statistical analysis plan was agreed and signed off before database lock, and the Chief Investigator and trial statisticians had access to the final dataset.\n\nThe trial was prospectively registered (ISRCTN12923441) before recruiting the first patient. An independent Data Monitoring Committee (see Acknowledgments) met at regular intervals during recruitment to review efficacy and safety data. As Chief Investigator, the first author takes responsibility for the integrity of this report. All authors have read and agree to the manuscript as written. The funder had no role in study design, data collection, analysis, interpretation, or reporting.\n\nResults\n\nBetween October 24, 2016, and December 8, 2020, 306 children were screened, of whom 223 (72.9%) met the trial eligibility criteria and of these, 82 (36.8%) were excluded for logistical or other reasons; 20 (14.2%) parents of otherwise eligible children declined consent. The CONSORT flow diagram is shown in Figure E1 . Recruitment was paused between March 13, 2020, and June 29, 2020, due to the impact of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 pandemic on the National Health Service ( Supplementary Methods ). A total of 121 infants/young children were randomized: 61 to RIPC and 60 to control. One child in the RIPC group was later found to be ineligible and did not proceed to surgery so was excluded from the analysis, leaving 60 participants in each group who underwent surgery and completed follow-up. Baseline characteristics were similar between groups ( Table 1 ), and operative data are shown in Table 2 . Adherence to treatment allocation was achieved in 116 (96.7%) participants, 56 (93%) in the RIPC group, who received 3 confirmed cycles of limb ischemia-reperfusion, and 60 (100%) in the control group (Supplementary Results). There was 1 (<1%) protocol deviation with propofol inadvertently used for induction of anesthesia in a participant in the RIPC arm.\n\nPrimary Outcome\n\nComplete postoperative troponin data were available for 114 children (56 RIPC, 58 control) who were included in the primary analysis. Overall, the mean AUC for hs-troponin-T was higher (ie, worse) in the RIPC group (70.0 ± 50.9 μg/L/h) compared with control (55.6 ± 30.16 μg/L/h) (mean difference 13.2 μg/L/h; 95% CI, 0.5-25.8; P = .04) ( Figure 2 and Table E1 ). The per-protocol analysis supported the primary analysis (mean difference 15.5; 95% CI, 2.6-28.3; P = .02). Prespecified subgroup analyses did not show a differential treatment effect in cyanotic and acyanotic children (interaction P value = .25). However, for age and congenital heart defect, there was some evidence of a possible interaction: age less than 1 year, mean difference 20.8 (95% CI, 6.1-35.4) versus 1 year or more, mean difference −6.7 (95% CI, −30.6 to 17.3) (interaction P value = .06); congenital heart defect: unstented TOF, mean difference 30.9 (95% CI, 12.2-49.6); stented TOF, mean difference 7.8 (95% CI, −27.7, 43.4); VSD, mean difference −3.2 (95% CI, −22.0 to 15.5) (interaction P value = .04) ( Figure 3 , Table 3 , Tables E2 and E3 ).\n\nSecondary Outcomes and Adverse Events\n\nThere were no differences between groups in any of the secondary outcome measures ( Table 4 and Figure E2 ) or the exploratory outcome ( Table E4 ). No immediate limb complications were observed, and there were no differences in adverse events ( Table 5 ). There were 11 serious adverse events in 9 participants: 4 in the RIPC group and 5 in the control group (Supplementary Results); all were assessed to be unrelated to the trial intervention.\n\nMetabolic Phenotyping\n\nRight atrial biopsies were collected at the onset of ischemia (median 4 minutes after crossclamping) and at the end of ischemia (median 53 minutes after crossclamping), and analysis was performed in 40 participants, 20 in each group. With correction for multiple testing (q < 0.05), in both early and late ischemia, there were no differences in myocardial tissue metabolites or enrichment of metabolic pathways between participants receiving RIPC or sham intervention.\n\nDiscussion\n\nWe found that adequately delivered, perioperative, bilateral RIPC, compared with sham inflation-deflation cycles, did not reduce myocardial injury in children undergoing elective surgery for common congenital heart defects. Troponin was slightly higher in patients randomized to RIPC; this effect was increased in the per protocol analysis and was mainly due to greater postoperative troponin in children with unstented TOF. This is the first trial to directly compare outcomes of RIPC in children with cyanotic and acyanotic congenital heart defects undergoing surgery at a similar age, 16 and our findings suggest that bilateral RIPC may exacerbate myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury in children with TOF. RIPC did not alter postoperative inotropic support, length of ICU or hospital stay, or postoperative complications. The immediate clinical implication of our results is to avoid RIPC during pediatric cardiac surgery.\n\nOverall AUC hs-troponin-T was higher in patients with TOF compared with those with an isolated VSD ( Figure E3 ), reflecting a longer ischemic time and more frequent RVOT muscle resection. On subgroup analysis, we found no difference in troponin related to preoperative oxygen saturations above or below 90%, but there was some evidence of an interaction with age ( P = .06), suggestive of greater myocardial injury in those aged less than 1 year who received RIPC, independent of defect type.\n\nThe promise of this simple, low-risk, inexpensive, and readily available intervention as an adjunct to current methods for myocardial protection has prompted numerous trials in adults 21 , 22 , 23 , 24 , 25 , 26 and children 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 , 11 , 12 , 13 , 14 but with mixed results. Two large multicenter trials in adults failed to show benefit in composite cardiovascular end points or troponin release, 25 , 26 but both studies were criticized for using propofol after it had been shown to interfere with the preconditioning pathway. 15 In a 2017 meta-analysis that included 793 children from 9 trials, Tan and colleagues 27 determined that RIPC has a cardioprotective effect, with reduced troponin at 6 hours, lower inotrope scores in the first 12 hours, and reduced postoperative ICU stay; however, they were unable to include the largest trial (n = 299) in most analyses due to a lack of suitable published data. Therefore, our trial makes an important contribution to the literature, raising major doubts about the use of RIPC in pediatric cardiac surgery.\n\nCheung and colleagues 6 first demonstrated reductions in troponin and inotropic requirements with RIPC in a heterogeneous cohort of 37 children, most of whom had TOF or VSD, a similar population to our trial. Several small studies found improved myocardial protection, with reduced early troponin in young children undergoing VSD closure, 7 , 8 whereas others found no benefit in neonates or infants undergoing other cardiac operations. 9 , 10 , 11 , 14 In the largest pediatric trial of RIPC to date, McCrindle and colleagues 12 found no benefit in clinical outcomes, physiological biomarkers, or subgroup analyses in a mixed cohort of 299 children aged 0 to 17 years and proposed that better than expected outcomes in the control group, heterogeneity of underlying conditions, and use of propofol may have affected their findings. Failure to elicit a stimulus may have been a key factor; manual inflation of the cuff to just 15 mm Hg above systolic pressure may have led to periods of subclinical reperfusion and the abolition of any preconditioning response. However, our findings support those of McCrindle and colleagues that RIPC has little or no effect on clinical end points, and therefore its role as a protective strategy in children is limited.\n\nA double-blind, randomized trial of 112 children undergoing complete repair of TOF in Wuhan, China, published in 2018 found a reduced duration of ICU stay and lower AUC for troponin-T in the first 24 hours with RIPC versus control. 13 Although patients underwent surgery at a similar age (11 months) as that in our trial, they were primarily acyanotic with mean preoperative oxygen saturations of 97% to 98% (SD, ±3%-4%), which is markedly different to our unstented TOF group (median, 88%; IQR, 86-97) in whom recent hypercyanotic spells were common. The authors also did not mention any prerepair interventions for severe cyanosis, either Blalock-Thomas-Taussig shunt or RVOT stenting. These factors suggest that the pattern of TOF in their population is different than that seen in Europe and North America, 28 or elsewhere in China. 29 This may be due to the higher incidence of a fibrous rather than muscular outlet septum in TOF in parts of East Asia, reducing the extent of RVOT obstruction and cyanosis, 30 and explain the divergence of findings.\n\nThe mechanism underlying RIPC and its potential interaction with chronic cyanosis in ischemia-reperfusion injury associated with cardioplegic arrest is not clearly understood. RIPC has been shown to induce regulatory phosphorylation of key intracellular proteins involved in pro-survival metabolic signaling. 31 , 32 Pepe and colleagues 10 evaluated the effect of RIPC on phosphorylated protein signaling in cyanotic children with TOF undergoing surgical repair; they found that signaling pathways were upregulated in resected RVOT muscle from both groups, supporting the hypothesis that the children may already have been preconditioned by exposure to chronic hypoxemia since birth, preempting any potential benefit from RIPC. In the same cohort, Hepponstall and colleagues 33 reported postoperative plasma proteomic changes in the RIPC group, with higher expression of proteins involved in metabolism, hemostasis, immunity, and inflammation that may be involved in RIPC-mediated cellular protection. In experimental models of ischemia-reperfusion, accumulation of succinate is a key metabolic signature of ischemia and drives the generation of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species during reperfusion, leading to cellular injury. 34 Therefore, we postulated that RIPC may impact the myocardial metabolic phenotype during ischemia; however, our analysis of right atrial samples found no significant differences in metabolites or metabolic pathways between the RIPC and control arms. These novel findings suggest that downstream myocardial metabolism does not play a major role in mediating the effects of RIPC in children undergoing cardioplegic arrest.\n\nIn this trial, we addressed the methodological concerns raised over previous trials. A pressure-controlled digital tourniquet system was used, set to 50 mm Hg or greater above systolic pressure to avoid subclinical reperfusion during the ischemic phase of each cycle, 12 with loss of arterial flow confirmed by distal pulse oximetry. A more intensive 2-cuff technique was used, 24 applying a concurrent stimulus to both lower limbs to compensate for the lower skeletal muscle mass. We avoided propofol anesthesia, which has been shown to attenuate the effects of RIPC 15 , 19 and excluded infants aged less than 3 months in whom the immature myocardium may be less responsive to RIPC. 11 This trial is the first multicenter cardiac surgical trial in children in the United Kingdom and demonstrates the value of collaboration to achieve recruitment targets in this challenging field.\n\nStudy Strengths and Limitations\n\nThe randomized, double-blind design, robust and verified delivery of bilateral RIPC, and quantification of a validated biomarker outcome are key strengths of our study. The results are consistent across analyses, including sensitivity analyses and comparison of secondary outcomes. The sample size calculation was based on analysis of the primary outcome in all participants, and therefore subgroup analyses should be seen as exploratory. It was also based on published studies using standard (fourth-generation) troponin assays, whereas we used an hs (fifth-generation) assay, which is now the preferred biomarker for determining myocardial injury. 35 Although troponin isoforms may be released from injured skeletal muscle, we found no difference between the RIPC and control groups in patients with a VSD, reassuring that the bilateral RIPC stimulus did not cause significant peripheral troponin-T release. Resection of right ventricular infundibulum or removal of an RVOT stent is likely to have increased troponin release, narrowing the effect of RIPC and predisposing to a type II error; despite this, RIPC remained associated with a greater AUC in patients with TOF. We defined preoperative cyanosis as resting oxygen saturations in room air of less than 90%, but TOF is a dynamic condition in which the right-to-left shunt and saturations may fluctuate, weakening the use of a single measurement to determine dichotomous groups; this may have partly accounted for the differential effects seen by congenital heart defect versus preoperative oxygen saturations.\n\nConclusions\n\nBilateral RIPC does not improve cardioprotection in young children undergoing operative repair of common congenital heart defects and may be harmful in those with unstented TOF. Therefore, the routine use of RIPC cannot be recommended, and alternative methods to improve myocardial protection and outcomes of surgery for congenital heart disease should be sought.\n\nTrial Management Committee\n\nNigel E.
