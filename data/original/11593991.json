  "title": "Endothelial TGF-β Signaling Regulates Endothelial-Mesenchymal Transition During Arteriovenous Fistula Remodeling in Mice With Chronic Kidney Disease",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND:: Arteriovenous fistulae (AVF) are the preferred vascular access for hemodialysis in patients with end-stage kidney disease. Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is associated with endothelial injury, impaired AVF maturation, and reduced patency, as well as utilization. Because CKD is characterized by multiple pathophysiological processes that induce endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EndMT), we hypothesized that CKD promotes EndMT during venous remodeling and that disruption of endothelial TGF (transforming growth factor)-β signaling inhibits EndMT to prevent AVF failure even in the end-stage kidney disease environment.\n\nMETHODS:: The mouse 5/6 nephrectomy and aortocaval fistula models were used. CKD was created via 5/6 nephrectomy, with controls of no (0/6) or partial (3/6) nephrectomy in C57BL/6J mice. AVF were created in mice with knockdown of TGF-βR1/R2 (TGF-β receptors type 1/2) in either smooth muscle cells or endothelial cells. AVF diameters and patency were measured and confirmed by serial ultrasound examination. AVF, both murine and human, were examined using Western blot, histology, and immunofluorescence. Human and mouse endothelial cells were used for in vitro experiments.\n\nRESULTS:: CKD accelerates TGF-β activation and promotes EndMT that is associated with increased AVF wall thickness and reduced patency in mice. Inhibition of TGF-β signaling in both endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells decreased smooth muscle cell proliferation in the AVF wall, attenuated EndMT, and was associated with reduced wall thickness, increased outward remodeling, and improved AVF patency. Human AVF also showed increased TGF-β signaling and EndMT.\n\nCONCLUSIONS:: CKD promotes EndMT and reduces AVF patency. Inhibition of TGF-β signaling, especially disruption of endothelial cell–specific TGF-β signaling, attenuates EndMT and improves AVF patency in mouse AVF. Inhibition of EndMT may be a therapeutic approach of translational significance to improve AVF patency in human patients with CKD.",

Additional experimental details and antibodies are available in the Supplemental Methods and Materials and Figure S1A and S1B .\n\nHuman Samples\n\nThe principles outlined in the Declaration of Helsinki were followed. This study was approved by the Human Investigation Committee of Yale University. Deidentified vein and AVF samples were collected from patients with CKD undergoing AVF creation as described previously. 29 Control veins and AVF were matched or unmatched samples from different patients ( Table S1 ). The control veins were veins that did not have an AVF but were discarded as part of the operative procedure; the AVF were small segments of mature AVF that were harvested during second-stage basilic vein transpositions. Part of the samples was fixed in 10% formalin before paraffin embedding and cut into 5-μm-thick sections, and another part was frozen at −80 °C.\n\nAnimals\n\nMice used for this study included wild-type female and male C57BL/6J, male Myh11-CreER T2 ; Tgfbr1 fl/fl ; Tgfbr2 fl/fl ; mT/mG , or male Cdh5-CreER T2 ; Tgfbr1 fl/fl ; Tgfbr2 fl/fl ; mT/mG . C57BL/6J mice were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME). Myh11-CreER T2 ; Tgfbr1 fl/fl ; Tgfbr2 fl/fl ; mT/mG and Cdh5-CreER T2 ; Tgfbr1 fl/fl ; Tgfbr2 fl/fl ; mT/mG were generated as described previously. 30 – 32 The bacterial artificial chromosome containing Myh11-CreER T2 inserts on the Y chromosome and female mice do not express the construct.\n\nAnimal Models\n\nAll animal experiments were performed in strict compliance with federal guidelines and with approval from the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Yale University. Mice were fed a regular diet (18% protein rodent diet, diet number 2018S; Teklad). For surgery, anesthesia was administered using 2% to 2.5% isoflurane. For the AVF model, mice were 9 to 11 weeks of age when the surgeries were performed. Briefly, after exposing the inferior vena cava (IVC) and aorta, an aortocaval fistula was created by puncturing the distal aorta into the IVC using a 25-gauge needle, as described previously. 28 , 33 For the CKD model, 5/6 nephrectomy (5/6 Nx) was performed 3 weeks before AVF creation; the superior and inferior 1/3 of the left kidney was ligated and the right kidney was removed ( Figure S1C ). 34 , 35\n\nHistology\n\nAnimals were euthanized and perfused with normal saline followed by 10% formalin via the left ventricle under physiological pressure, and the AVF was extracted en bloc. The tissue was then embedded in paraffin and cut into 5-μm cross sections. Part of the animals were perfused with cold 4% paraformaldehyde, and the vessels were fixed overnight in 4% paraformaldehyde at 4 °C, cryoprotected in 15% sucrose for 6 to 8 hours at 4 °C, embedded in OCT (optimal cutting temperature), and 5-μm-thick sections were obtained. Elastin van Gieson staining was used to measure the intima-media thickness, hematoxylin and eosin staining was used to count the number of medial cells, and trichrome and picrosirius red staining was used to measure collagen density in 5-μm cross sections of the IVC using sections obtained 50 to 200 µm cranial to the fistula. Eight equidistant points around the IVC wall were averaged in each cross section to obtain the mean AVF wall thickness, which refers to both the intima and media, because in the veins of mice and rats, there is only 1 elastic lamina that separates the media and the adventitia. 36 Because this elastic lamina is not always discernable throughout the cross sections, we considered the dark-stained layer alongside the vessel lumen, using van Gieson staining, as the intima-media layer. 28 , 29 Additional unstained cross sections in this same region were used for immunofluorescence microscopy.\n\nCell Culture\n\nMouse lung EC were prepared and cultured as described previously. 31 , 37 Additional details are in the Supplemental Methods . Human umbilical vein EC were cultured in endothelial basal medium-2, supplemented with the EGM (Endothelial Cell Growth Medium)-2MV BulletKit (CC-3202; Lonza). Human umbilical vein EC were seeded into 6-cm plates to be 100% confluent the next day. Human umbilical vein EC were starved with 0.5% fetal bovine serum in EGM-2 media for 6 hours and then treated without or with TGF-β1 for 48 hours.\n\nStatistics\n\nAll data were analyzed using the Prism 9 software (GraphPad Software, Inc, La Jolla, CA). Data are represented as mean±SEM. The Shapiro-Wilk test was performed to test for normality; the F test was performed to evaluate homogeneity of variances. For 2-group comparisons, the unpaired Student t test was used for normally distributed data. Welch correction was used for data with unequal variances. For multiple group comparisons with normally distributed data, the 1-way ANOVA followed by the Tukey post hoc test was used. For comparisons involving 2 factors, the 2-way ANOVA followed by the Sidak post hoc test was used. For data that were not normally distributed or when the sample sizes were <6, the nonparametric Mann-Whitney U test was used for 2-group comparisons, and the Kruskal-Wallis test followed by the Dunn multiple comparisons test was used for multiple groups. For 2-group comparisons of categorical values, the Fisher exact test was used. Patency and survival were analyzed with the Kaplan-Meier analysis. P values of <0.05 were considered to indicate statistical significance.\n\nResults\n\n5/6 Nx Affects Venous Remodeling\n\nTo determine whether CKD affects venous remodeling, we used a subtotal nephrectomy (5/6 Nx) mouse model of CKD, with both sham nephrectomy (0/6 Nx) and unilateral nephrectomy (3/6) used as control groups. The blood creatinine and blood urea nitrogen were significantly increased in mice with 5/6 Nx at day 7 and afterward ( Figure S1D and S1E ) but not in mice with 3/6 nephrectomy ( Figure S1F and S1G ).\n\nThe mean IVC diameter was significantly increased after AVF creation, without or with nephrectomy, compared with sham-operated mice (Figure 1 A); similarly, mean shear stress ( Figure S2A ) and blood flow ( Figure S2B ) were increased in all mice with an AVF compared with sham-operated mice. Among sham-operated mice, there was no difference in the IVC diameter (Figure 1 A), shear stress ( Figure S2A ), and blood flow ( Figure S2B ) among mice without or with 5/6 Nx. However, among mice with an AVF, the IVC diameter in mice with 5/6 Nx was significantly decreased compared with mice with 0/6 Nx (red line versus green line; P =0.0051; Figure 1 A). Similarly, IVC wall thickness was increased in mice with an AVF compared with control groups (Figure 1 B and 1 D), with increased wall thickness in mice with 5/6 Nx compared with mice with 0/6 Nx (red bar versus green bar; P <0.0001; Figure 1 B and 1 D). These data show decreased outward remodeling and increased wall thickness, for example, altered venous remodeling, in mice with 5/6 Nx.\n\n5/6 Nx Accelerates Cell Proliferation and ECM Deposition\n\nSince 5/6 Nx is associated with increased AVF wall thickness, and increased wall thickness may be due to increased numbers of cells or accumulation of ECM (extracellular matrix), we determined the effect of 5/6 Nx on cell proliferation and ECM deposition. By day 21, there were increased numbers of EC proliferating in the AVF wall that were associated with increased wall thickness (AVF versus sham; Figure S2C and S2G ); similarly, smooth muscle cell (SMC) proliferation was significantly increased after AVF creation (day 21; AVF versus sham; Figure 1 C and 1 E) with no difference in SMC apoptosis ( Figure S2D and S2H ). Mice with 5/6 Nx had increased SMC proliferation compared with mice with 0/6 Nx (red bar versus green bar; P =0.0483; Figure 1 C). EC proliferation showed a similar trend, with increased percentage in AVF and increased percentage in mice treated with 5/6 Nx compared with 0/6 Nx ( Figure S2C and S2G ). These data show increased SMC proliferation during venous remodeling that is further increased in mice with 5/6 Nx.\n\nWe next determined whether 5/6 Nx affects the accumulation of several components of the ECM in the AVF wall during the remodeling. By day 21, increased fibronectin, collagen-1, and collagen-3 immunoreactivity were detected in the AVF wall compared with the wall of sham-operated mice (Figure 1 F through 1 K; Figure S2E, S2F, S2I, and S2J ). Mice with 5/6 Nx had increased accumulation of ECM components compared with mice with 0/6 Nx (red bars versus green bars; Figure 1 I through 1 K; Figure S2I and S2J ). These data show increased accumulation of ECM components during venous remodeling that is increased in mice with 5/6 Nx.\n\nSince 5/6 Nx is associated with AVF wall thickness, as well as increased SMC proliferation and increased deposition of several components of the ECM, we next determined whether 5/6 Nx is also associated with decreased AVF patency. There was decreased AVF patency at day 42 in the CKD mice ( Figure S3 ; Table S2 ). These data show the functional significance of 5/6 Nx that is associated with reduced AVF patency.\n\n5/6 Nx Increases EndMT\n\nSince 5/6 Nx increases SMC proliferation during venous remodeling, and EndMT regulates SMC proliferation, we determined whether EndMT is present during venous remodeling. The immunoreactivity of endothelial marker VE-cadherin was decreased (Figure 2 A and 2 B), and the mesenchymal markers Notch-3 (neurogenic locus notch homolog protein 3), vimentin, α-SMA (α-smooth muscle actin), and FSP-1 (fibroblast-specific protein 1) were increased (Figure 2 C through 2 F) in the AVF wall compared with the sham-operated groups. In addition, the immunoreactivity of mesenchymal markers Notch-3, vimentin, α-SMA, and FSP-1 was increased in the AVF of mice with 5/6 Nx compared with the AVF of mice with 0/6 Nx (Figure 2 A and 2 C through 2 F); immunofluorescence showed that this increase was significant in EC (Figure 2 G through 2 L). These data show that venous remodeling is associated with increased markers of EndMT and that these markers are increased in mice with 5/6 Nx.\n\nIncreased EndMT and TGFβ Signaling in Human AVF\n\nTo determine whether EndMT is present in mature human AVF, we examined several markers of EndMT in patent AVF and control veins from patients with end-stage kidney disease. There was increased immunoreactivity of TGFβ1 both in EC (Figure 3 A and 3 C) and SMC ( Figure S4A and S4C ) in human AVF compared with the control vein. Interestingly, the immunoreactivity of TGFβ1 was increased in the EC layer compared with the SMC layer, both in the AVF and control vein ( Figure S4I and S4J ). Similarly, there was increased immunoreactivity of p-smad2 in AVF compared with the control vein, both in EC (Figure 3 B and 3 D) and SMC ( Figure S4B and S4D ). These data show increased immunoreactivity of the TGFβ1 pathway in patent human AVF.\n\nSince TGFβ1 signaling is associated with the accumulation of ECM proteins such as collagen and fibronectin, we determined the expression of ECM components in human AVF. Both collagen and fibronectin immunoreactivity were increased, in both EC and SMC layers, in mature AVF compared with control veins (Figure 3 E through 3 H ; Figure S4E through S4H ). Since collagen and fibronectin are markers of EndMT, 38 we next determined the expression of other EndMT markers Notch-3, vimentin, and FSP-1. The immunoreactivity of vimentin and α-SMA was significantly increased in AVF compared with the control vein (Figure 3 I through 3 K). Moreover, the expression of Notch-3, vimentin, and FSP-1 was increased in the AVF EC (Figure 3 L through 3 Q). These data show that increased TGFβ signaling is associated with EndMT during human AVF remodeling.\n\n5/6 Nx Increases TGF-β Signaling and the Inflammatory Response in Mouse AVF\n\nBecause TGF-β regulates EndMT and AVF remodeling, 27 we hypothesized that TGF-β expression is increased during venous remodeling in mice with 5/6 Nx. The expression of TGF-β1 was significantly increased in the AVF wall of mice with 5/6 Nx compared with mice with 0/6 Nx (day 7), with a significantly increased ratio of phosphorylated-to-total smad2 (p-smad2/smad2; Figure 4 A). Both TGF-β1 (Figure 4 B) and TAK-1 (TGF-β–activated kinase 1; Figure 4 C) immunoreactivity were significantly increased both in the EC and the SMC in the AVF wall of mice with 5/6 Nx. Similarly, both p-smad2 (Figure 4 D) and p-smad3 (Figure 4 E) immunoreactivity were significantly increased both in the EC and the SMC in the AVF wall of mice with 5/6 Nx compared with mice with 0/6 Nx. Similar data were detected in female mice ( Figure S5A through S5H ). Because CKD is characterized by inflammation and M2-type macrophages can produce TGF-β1, 39 – 41 we examined mice with 0/6 or 5/6 Nx; significantly increased numbers of M2-type macrophages were increased in the AVF wall of mice treated with 5/6 Nx ( Figure S6A ). These data suggest that both TGF-β signaling and the inflammatory response are increased during venous remodeling, which are increased in mice with 5/6 Nx, for example, 5/6 Nx is associated with both increased EndMT, TGF-β signaling, and inflammation.\n\nReduced EC TGF-β Signaling Affects Venous Remodeling and Increases AVF Patency\n\nWe have previously reported that inhibition of TGF-β signaling in EC regulates venous remodeling and increases AVF patency 27 ; however, it is not known whether this pathway is active in mice with 5/6 Nx. Cdh5-CreER T2 ; Tgfbr1 fl/fl ; Tgfbr2 fl/fl ; mT/mG mice were treated with tamoxifen (TGF-βR iEC ), whereas control littermates were treated with corn oil vehicle, 1 week after 5/6 Nx and 2 weeks before AVF creation ( Figure S1B ). Adequate Cre recombination was confirmed with the mT/mG reporter ( Figure S7A ), and there was a significantly decreased expression of TGF-βR1 (TGF-β receptor type 1; Figure S8A ) and TGF-βR2 (TGF-β receptor type 2; Figure S8B ), as well as decreased percentage of p-smad2–positive cells in all EC in the TGF-βR iEC mice compared with control mice ( Figure S7B ).\n\nMice with EC-specific Tgfbr1/Tgfbr2 knockdown showed significantly increased outward remodeling of the AVF (Figure 5 A and 5 B). There was significantly decreased AVF wall thickness at day 21 (Figure 5 C), and there was increased AVF patency at day 42 (Figure 5 D; Table S3 ). Since knockout of endothelial TGF-β type I and II receptors is associated with reduced AVF wall thickness, we determined whether there was reduced cell proliferation or ECM deposition. There were fewer PCNA (proliferating cell nuclear antigen)-positive cells in the AVF wall of EC-specific Tgfbr1/Tgfbr2 knockdown mice compared with control mice, with the reduction of proliferation in both EC (Figure 5 E and 5 I) and SMC ( Figure S9A ). In addition, these mice also showed significantly decreased collagen-1 immunoreactivity (Figure 5 F and 5 J; Figure S9B ), consistent with reduced ECM deposition in the AVF wall.\n\nBecause the activation of TGF-β signaling in EC is associated with proinflammatory effects including the activation of multiple inflammatory pathways and accelerated disease progression, 31 , 38 we determined whether reduced TGF-β signaling during venous remodeling in mice with 5/6 Nx could reduce several EC markers. As expected, TGF-βR iEC mice have a reduced percentage of VCAM-1 (vascular cell adhesion molecule 1)/CD31 dual positive cells (Figure 5 G and 5 K), as well as reduced expression of ICAM-1 (intercellular adhesion molecule 1; Figure 5 H and 5 L). Similarly, TGF-βR iEC mice showed decreased endothelial expression of Notch-3 and vimentin (Figure 6 A through 6 D).\n\nWhole-mount staining of the IVC with en face observation was performed at day 7; sham-operated mice with 5/6 Nx alone showed CD31 expression at the cell-cell junctions and little detectable expression of α-SMA (Figure 6 E through 6 G). Control mice with an AVF and 5/6 Nx showed reduced CD31 immunoreactivity and increased expression of α-SMA and FSP-1 (Figure 6 H and 6 I) on the luminal surface, consistent with EndMT on the luminal surface of AVF. However, TGF-βR iEC mice with 5/6 Nx showed recovery of CD31 and decreased immunoreactivity of α-SMA (Figure 6 E through 6 G), as well as reduced expression of FSP-1 (Figure 6 H and 6 I). These data show that endothelial-specific knockdown of TGF-β signaling reduces EndMT during venous remodeling even in mice with 5/6 Nx.\n\nReduced SMC TGF-β Signaling Also Affects Venous Remodeling and Increases AVF Patency\n\nSince endothelial-specific knockdown of TGF-β signaling reduces EndMT and increases AVF patency, we next determined whether SMC-specific knockdown of TGF-β signaling would have similar effects. We previously reported a lack of effects using an SMC-specific knockdown of TGFβR2, 27 but these experiments did not knock down TGFβR1 nor were they performed in mice with 5/6 Nx. Myh11-CreER T2 ; Tgfbr1 fl/fl ; Tgfbr2 fl/fl ; mT/mG mice were treated with tamoxifen (TGF-βR iSMC ), whereas control littermates were treated with corn oil vehicle, 1 week after 5/6 Nx and 2 weeks before AVF creation ( Figure S1B ). Adequate Cre recombination was confirmed with the mT/mG reporter ( Figure S7C ), and there was a significantly decreased expression of TGF-βR1 ( Figure S8C ) and TGF-βR2 ( Figure S8D ), as well as decreased percentage of p-smad2–positive cells in all SMC in the TGF-βR iSMC mice compared with control mice ( Figure S7C ).\n\nMice with SMC-specific Tgfbr1/Tgfbr2 knockdown showed significantly increased outward remodeling of the AVF (Figure 7 A and 7 B). There was significantly decreased AVF wall thickness at day 21 (Figure 7 C), and there was a trend toward increased AVF patency at day 42 (Figure 7 D; Table S4 ). There were fewer PCNA-positive cells in the AVF wall of SMC-specific Tgfbr1/Tgfbr2 knockdown mice compared with control mice, with the reduction of proliferation in both SMC (Figure 7 E and 7 I) and EC ( Figure S10A ). In addition, these mice also showed significantly decreased collagen-1 immunoreactivity (Figure 7 F and 7 J; Figure S10B ), consistent with reduced ECM deposition in the AVF wall. There was no difference in the percentage of the VCAM-1/CD31 dual positive cells between the 2 groups ( Figure S10C ), as well as the percentage of the ICAM-1/CD31 dual positive cells ( Figure S10D ). However, mice with SMC-specific Tgfbr1/Tgfbr2 knockdown showed reduced immunoreactivity of endothelial Notch-3 (Figure 7 G and 7 K) and vimentin (Figure 7 H and 7 L). In toto, these data show that SMC-specific knockdown of TGF-β signaling reduces EndMT and promotes outward remodeling during venous remodeling even in mice with 5/6 Nx.\n\nInhibition of TGF-β in EC In Vitro Suppresses Markers of EndMT\n\nBecause markers of EndMT are present during AVF remodeling in human AVF (Figure 3 ) and in mice with 5/6 Nx (Figure 2 ), and markers of TGF-β1 signaling are increased during venous remodeling in mice with 5/6 Nx (Figure 4 ), we determined whether inhibition of TGF-β1 in EC in vitro would reduce the expression of markers of EndMT. Exogenous TGF-β1 decreased immunoreactivity of CD31 in a dose-dependent manner, with virtually complete suppression at 10 ng/mL (Figure 8 A and 8 B). Similarly, TGF-β1 increased immunoreactivity of vimentin in a dose-dependent manner, with maximal stimulation at 10 ng/mL (Figure 8 A and 8 C). Immunofluorescence confirmed these data, as well as increased detection of α-SMA and FSP-1 (Figure 8 D through 8 I). Markers of EndMT in EC could also be attenuated by the anti-inflammatory drug dexamethasone with increased immunoreactivity of CD31 and decreased immunoreactivity of vimentin ( Figure S11 ).\n\nPrimary mouse lung EC were isolated and cultured from TGF-βR iEC mice ( Cdh5-CreER T2 ; Tgfbr1 fl/fl ; Tgfbr2 fl/fl ; mT/mG mice) that were treated either with tamoxifen or vehicle alone as control in vivo before in vitro cell culture and treatment with TGF-β1 (10 ng/mL; 48 hours). The expression of TGFBR1 and TGFBR2 was significantly decreased in EC derived from TGF-βR iEC mice and treated with tamoxifen (Figure 8 J through 8 L); similarly, smad2 phosphorylation was reduced (Figure 8 J and 8 M). Markers of EndMT were decreased, including fibronectin, Notch-3, vimentin, and FSP-1 (Figure 8 J and 8 N through 8 Q), whereas the VE-cadherin immunoreactivity was increased (Figure 8 J and 8 R). These data show that reduced TGF-β1 signaling suppresses the expression of markers of EndMT in vitro.\n\nDiscussion\n\nWe show that CKD suppresses venous outward remodeling (Figure 1 ) and promotes EndMT (Figure 2 ) to alter venous remodeling that is associated with reduced AVF patency ( Figure S3 ). Both human AVF and mouse AVF are characterized by increased expression of TGF-β1 and phosphorylation of the canonical TGF-β/smad2 signaling pathway (Figures 2 through 4 ), suggesting the potential translational importance of this pathway. Knockdown of TGF-β signaling in EC (Figures 5 , 6 , and 8 ) as well as in SMC (Figure 7 ) reduced EndMT and improved outward remodeling to increase AVF patency.\n\nThe mechanisms by which CKD alters venous remodeling are complex. 5 , 6 , 42 We show activation (Figure 4 ) and functional significance (Figures 5 through 7 ) of the TGF-β1 signaling pathway, with increased EndMT (Figure 2 ) in mice treated with 5/6 Nx. These data are similar to previous data in mice without CKD; we previously showed that both canonical 27 and noncanonical 29 TGF-β1 signaling are present, and other groups have shown the presence of EndMT. 19 EndMT is characterized by loss of endothelial morphology and function and acquisition of a mesenchymal phenotype. 22 , 24 In vein grafts, EndMT contributes to neointimal hyperplasia and lumen narrowing and thus vein graft failure. 22 , 43 Similarly, in AVF, EndMT was observed in mice both without and with 5/6 Nx but with significantly increased ECM deposition and expression of EndMT markers (Figures 1 and 2 ), as well as increased TGFβ1 and p-smad2 expression (Figure 4 ) in mice treated with 5/6 Nx. TGF-β1 also activates Notch signaling to induce EndMT in a 5/6 Nx AVF model. 7 Thus, EndMT may be associated with venous remodeling, but EndMT is significantly increased in the presence of the CKD environment. Although EC activation should precede EndMT, since CKD is characterized by EC activation via multiple mechanisms, it is unclear whether EC activation can be discretely studied in vivo using this model, and thus the ultimate inciting event of EndMT during AVF remodeling is likely to be quite elusive. And since there is also increased inflammation in mice with CKD compared with control mice ( Figure S6 ), both TGF-β signaling and inflammation are associated with EndMT in this model. Suppression of inflammation inhibits markers of EndMT in human umbilical vein EC in vitro ( Figure S11 ), suggesting that it is both possible that inflammation regulates EndMT and that EndMT regulates the inflammatory response in the AVF. Thus, the complex CKD environment alters AVF remodeling via multiple mechanisms.\n\nTGF-β regulates EndMT, 22 , 31 , 44 and inhibition of the TGF-β/smad pathway reduces EndMT. 37 – 40 We have previously shown that EC-specific TGF-β signaling regulates venous adaptive remodeling to improve AVF patency; however, SMC-specific TGF-β signaling did not regulate AVF remodeling. 27 Here, we show that both EC-specific (Figures 5 , 6 , and 8 ) and SMC-specific (Figure 7 ) TGF-β signaling regulate AVF remodeling. We believe that our data showing the contribution of SMC-specific TGF-β signaling reflects both increased TGF-β in the presence of the CKD environment, and thus increased amount of substrate to inhibit, as well as inhibition of both TGF-βR1 and TGF-βR2, whereas we previously only knocked down the TGF-βR2 in SMC. 27 In addition, cross talk between different pathways and cell types affects EndMT. 25 In the CKD-induced inflammatory environment, TNF-α (tumor necrosis factor-α)–activated EC can induce SMC to express proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α, IL (interleukin)-6, and VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor), 45 showing 1 direction of influence. Conversely, SMC influence EC to create a cross-talk loop. 46 SMC cocultured with EC express higher levels of VEGF, PDGF (platelet-derived growth factor), and TGF-β compared with SMC cultured without EC; similarly, EC cocultured with SMC produce higher levels of VEGF than EC cultured alone. 47 These data suggest a mutual influence between SMC and EC.\n\nInterestingly, the source of TGF-β signaling in AVF is not known. In the CKD environment, multiple cells in AVF can produce TGF-β locally including EC, SMC, and macrophages 48 – 50 ; systemic circulating TGF-β may also infiltrate into AVF. Transcription of the TGF -β gene can be stimulated by a variety of factors present in the CKD environment and during AVF remodeling, including oxidative stress and cytokines such as TNF-α and IL-1β. 48 , 51 , 52 TGF-β is secreted by inflammatory cells as part of the inflammatory response, and AVF remodeling is characterized by infiltrating leucocytes and macrophages. 53 – 57 Here, we show that M2-type macrophages are present during AVF remodeling in the CKD environment, suggesting a source of TGF-β that may be attributed to the inflammatory response. 40 , 58 These data are compatible with a role for TGF-β regulating EndMT during venous remodeling, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target to improve venous remodeling in patients with CKD.\n\nWe examined fibronectin as one of the major components of ECM that is regulated in the remodeling venous wall, along with collagen 59 ; in addition, fibronectin is regulated by TGF-β signaling in this mouse AVF model. 29 CKD increases fibronectin accumulation in the AVF wall (Figure 1 ), correlating with increased markers of EndMT (Figure 2 ); however, it is not clear whether this represents increased synthesis of fibronectin or simply leakage through a compromised endothelial barrier. However, diminished fibronectin expression in EC derived from TGF-βR iEC mice treated with tamoxifen suggests that at least some fibronectin expression is due to the regulation of TGF-β signaling and EndMT (Figure 8 ). Nonetheless, additional studies examining the integrity of the endothelial barrier during CKD-mediated AVF remodeling are warranted.\n\nThis study has several limitations. Although we show that both murine and human AVF have increased TGF-β signaling (Figures 2 through 4 ), our murine aortocaval model does not use sutures as do most human AVF that are sutured together surgically. Although needle puncture may limit applicability to human sutured AVF, both the mouse and the human data show similar increased TGF-β signaling; nonetheless, the mouse model may be more applicable to human endo-AVF and is created via needle puncture. 60 – 62 In addition, the use of human samples as validation of the mouse model is imperfect, as the timing of obtaining the samples is limited by clinical needs; as such, the human samples rarely show inflammatory cells as seen in the mouse samples, since the human samples are typically collected at times when the inflammatory response is likely to be resolved. In addition, the degree of CKD among human patients was not able to be assessed. Nonetheless, the human samples show increased TGF-β signaling that is similar to that seen in the mouse AVF.\n\nIn summary, EndMT appears to be associated with venous remodeling, and EndMT is significantly increased in the presence of the CKD environment; TGF-β regulates EndMT during venous remodeling in the CKD environment. Inhibition of TGF-β signaling, especially disruption of EC-specific TGF-β signaling, attenuates EndMT to reduce excessive wall thickening, promote outward remodeling, and improve AVF patency.\n\nArticle Information\n\nSources of Funding\n\nThis work was supported by the US National Institutes of Health grants R01-HL128406 and R01-HL144476 (to A.
