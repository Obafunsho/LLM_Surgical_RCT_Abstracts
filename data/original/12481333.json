Furthermore, the structural mismatch between veins and arteries exposes the saphenous vein to high aortic pressures, contributing to endothelial damage and neointimal proliferation. 5 Studies report that after CABG, approximately 10–20% of SVGs occlude within the first year. 6 7\n\nTo address these issues, the ‘no-touch’ CABG has emerged as an alternative option. Connecting the SVG to the right internal mammary artery (RIMA) as a ‘no-touch’ CABG technique avoids the use of side clamps, reduces the risk of aortic injury and relieves the pressure burden on the great saphenous vein. 8 Existing studies 9 10 have identified this technique as a viable option for CABG in single-vessel right coronary artery bypass procedures. However, research on the use of RIMA-SVG for multiple grafts remains limited. Our study aims to fill this gap by investigating graft patency and clinical outcomes of RIMA-SVG in the multivessel CABG patient population.\n\nGiven the potential procedural advantages of the RIMA-SVG technique—particularly its ability to minimise aortic manipulation—a non-inferiority trial is justified to evaluate whether it can achieve comparable graft patency to the conventional Ao-SVG approach. This study is designed to compare the 1-year SVG patency rate between the two techniques, along with perioperative complications, MACCE and other short-term clinical outcomes. To our knowledge, this is the first internationally registered randomised controlled trial to assess the efficacy and safety of RIMA-SVG versus Ao-SVG in multivessel CABG. If non-inferiority is demonstrated, RIMA-SVG may serve as a technically safer and clinically viable alternative to Ao-SVG in appropriate patients.\n\nMethods\n\nDesign\n\nThis prospective, single-centre, double-blind and randomised clinical trial with a non-inferiority design, approved by the Ethics Committee of the Second Hospital of Jilin University (No. 460) and prospectively registered at ClinicalTrials.gov ( NCT06787651 ), aims to evaluate whether the RIMA-SVG method is non-inferior to the Ao-SVG approach in terms of SVG patency, perioperative complications and MACCE. The entire trial will be conducted at the Second Hospital of Jilin University (Changchun City, Jilin Province, China). The trial is planned to begin on 1 February 2025 and will conclude on 30 July 2026. Participants will be followed for 12 months post-surgery to assess the primary and secondary outcomes. A total of 300 patients undergoing isolated CABG will be enrolled and randomly assigned into two groups based on the surgical technique: the Ao-SVG group and the RIMA-SVG group, with 150 patients in each group. Follow-up visits will occur at 12 months post-surgery, including coronary CT angiography (CCTA) to assess SVG patency. To ensure graft quality and minimise variability, all CABG procedures and graft harvesting will be performed by certified surgeons. A flowchart depicting the study procedures is shown in figure 1 . The protocol follows the SPIRIT 2013 guidelines, and the completed SPIRIT checklist is available in online supplemental file 1 .\n\nPatient population\n\nInclusion criteria\n\nExclusion criteria\n\nRandomisation and blinding\n\nThis study employs computer-generated random number lists for randomisation. Patients are first assigned to two groups based on the surgical approach using a 1:1 ratio. The randomisation sequence is generated by researchers not involved in the clinical trial and managed through a secure digital platform. Group allocation is concealed until surgery. The randomisation sequence is generated by independent researchers and accessed intraoperatively by the surgical team following baseline assessment. Group allocation is revealed to the surgical team only during the procedure, while patients and the broader research team remain blinded throughout the study. To ensure blinding integrity, an independent research team is responsible for generating and managing the group allocation information. Data analysts remain unaware of group details until statistical analysis commences, minimising bias and ensuring the scientific rigour and impartiality of the study.\n\nSample size estimates\n\nThe sample size for this trial was calculated based on a non-inferiority design. Assuming a 1-year SVG patency rate of 90% in the control group (Ao-SVG) and a non-inferiority margin of 10%, with 80% power and a one-sided alpha of 0.025, a minimum of 326 grafts per group is required to demonstrate non-inferiority. After adjusting for an anticipated 20% dropout rate, the total enrolment target was increased to 816 grafts (408 per group), which corresponds to approximately 300 patients (150 per group), assuming an average of three SVGs per patient.\n\nTreatments or interventions\n\nTo minimise bias due to surgeons' experience and preferences, all interventions will be performed by two qualified surgical experts. Each surgeon must have completed at least 500 surgeries of each type before participating in the study. Prior to surgery, patients using antiplatelet drugs other than aspirin must discontinue ticagrelor for at least 3 days, clopidogrel for 5 days and prasugrel for 7 days. All patients will undergo beating-heart CABG via median sternotomy. Off-pump CABG will be the standard procedure, while cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) will be employed only in cases of intraoperative complications. The IMA will be harvested using the pedicled method, and the LIMA will be used to bypass lesions of the left anterior descending artery. Both groups will use the SVG to sequentially graft the right coronary artery (RCA), circumflex artery (LCX) and diagonal branch. The difference is that in the RIMA-SVG group, the SVG will be anastomosed end-to-side to the RIMA. In the Ao-SVG group, the ascending aorta will be clamped, and the SVG will be anastomosed end-to-side to the aorta ( figure 2 ). Sequential grafting and the location of the proximal anastomosis may present technical challenges, but we will closely monitor them to ensure the safety and efficacy of the procedure. During surgery, all patients will receive the same anaesthetic protocol. The initial dose of heparin will be 1 mg/kg, with additional doses administered to maintain an activated clotting time (ACT) >300 s. After surgery, all patients will receive dual antiplatelet therapy.\n\nOutcome measurements\n\nBaseline measurements will be taken prior to the intervention, which will include the completion of a demographic questionnaire assessing participant characteristics, such as gender, age and body mass index.\n\nPrimary outcome\n\nThe primary endpoint is the 1-year graft occlusion rate of saphenous vein grafts (SVGs). Graft patency will be evaluated using coronary CCTA, and graft outcomes will be classified according to the FitzGibbon grading system.\n\nSecondary outcomes\n\nAll clinical events will be adjudicated by an independent Clinical Event Committee (CEC) based on pre-specified criteria.\n\nData management\n\nOn successful recruitment, participants will be assigned numerical codes to replace their personal identifiers, ensuring their privacy. Two researchers will be responsible for entering the paper-based data into a centralised database. To ensure data quality and accuracy, a third researcher will review the entered data, comparing it with the original source. All paper-based documents and electronic files will be securely archived and backed up under the supervision of the principal investigator. These files will be retained for 5 years after the completion of the study.\n\nStatistical analysis\n\nThe statistical methods will be applied based on the data types. Normally distributed data will be expressed as mean±SD and compared using the independent samples t-test. Non-normally distributed data will be expressed as median (IQR) and compared using the Mann-Whitney U test. Categorical data will be described by frequency or percentage and analysed using the chi-square test (χ²) or Fisher’s exact test. For event time data, Kaplan-Meier survival analysis will be used to estimate the survival curves for different groups. The primary outcomes will be analysed using intention-to-treat analysis, with comparisons made according to group assignment. For the primary outcome, a non-inferiority analysis will be performed by constructing a one-sided 97.5% CI for the difference in graft occlusion rates between groups. Non-inferiority will be claimed if the upper confidence limit is less than the predefined non-inferiority margin of 10%. Missing data will be handled using worst-case imputation, assuming missing grafts are occluded. And sensitivity analysis will be conducted to assess the impact of missing data on the results. Statistical significance will be set at a p-value<0.05, and all analyses will be performed using SPSS V.26.0 software (IBM, New York, USA).\n\nData monitoring and safety committee\n\nBefore recruitment begins, an independent Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will be established. According to the DSMB charter, an interim analysis will be conducted once 50% of participants have completed the scheduled follow-up. The DSMB’s review will focus primarily on safety concerns. The DSMB will evaluate whether the trial should be halted due to unexpected risks to participants. If no significant safety signals are detected, the trial will proceed until the recruitment target is met, and data analysis will be performed based on the full population.\n\nDiscussion\n\nThere are three approaches to CABG: on-pump with cardioplegic arrest, on-pump beating-heart and off-pump beating-heart CABG. Although on-pump CABG with cardioplegic arrest eliminates the need for partial clamping of the aortic wall, it still requires aortic cross-clamping for occlusion. Additionally, both on-pump beating-heart and off-pump beating-heart CABG typically involve the use of a side-biting clamp for proximal anastomosis. These factors increase the risk of dislodging fragile aortic wall material. Research has shown that during aortic clamping and release, transcranial Doppler ultrasound can detect embolic shower phenomena, suggesting that Ao-SVG may effectively increase the occurrence of particulate microembolism. 11 While most studies on postoperative neurological complications have focused on comparisons between on-pump and off-pump CABG, research specifically on aortic ‘non-contact’ techniques remains limited. Therefore, our study used the RIMA-SVG method, which avoids manipulation of the aorta and may contribute to reducing neurological complications after CABG.\n\nStudies suggest that using the SVG as a secondary graft in an IMA composite graft, compared with the traditional Ao-SVG approach, may result in more favourable blood flow patterns. This is reflected in three main aspects. First, the angle of the Ao-SVG anastomosis is typically larger; in contrast, the RIMA-SVG anastomosis angle is almost nonexistent. Studies indicate that a larger anastomotic angle leads to greater energy loss, resulting in higher turbulence and shear stress at the junction, which causes endothelial damage and promotes the development of intimal hyperplasia. 12 14 Second, RIMA-SVG experiences lower circulatory pressure compared with those anastomosed to the ascending aorta, which reduces intimal hyperplasia, atherosclerosis and endothelial damage. 15 16 The occlusion of SVGs typically involves damage to the vessel wall due to exposure to arterial pressure, which is considered a key factor. Evidence suggests that endothelial cell loss is proportional to saphenous vein pressure. 5 Elevated pressure can exacerbate the destruction of the basement membrane and fibrous collagen, as well as cause intimal fissures, thereby accelerating thrombosis and triggering an inflammatory response that leads to atherosclerosis and neointimal hyperplasia. 17 Furthermore, SVGs are continuously exposed to endothelial-protective substances, such as nitric oxide, produced by the IMA, which may further lower the risk of atherosclerosis. 18 Therefore, RIMA-SVG may improve graft patency and reduce the incidence of atherosclerosis. We chose a non-inferiority design rather than a superiority trial because the RIMA-SVG approach may provide practical and clinical advantages such as reduced aortic manipulation and fewer neurological complications, even if graft patency is only comparable rather than superior to Ao-SVG. This approach aims to offer a technically safer and more feasible surgical strategy, which, if proven non-inferior in efficacy, may improve procedural safety without compromising clinical outcomes.\n\nHowever, several limitations should be acknowledged. First, the relatively small sample size and single-centre design may limit the generalisability and external validity of the findings. Second, the 1 year follow-up period may be insufficient to fully evaluate the long-term durability of the RIMA-SVG strategy, highlighting the need for future multi-centre trials with extended follow-up. Finally, due to the inherent nature of the surgical procedures, blinding of the operating surgeons is not feasible, which may introduce a degree of performance bias that should be taken into account when interpreting the clinical outcomes.",
