  "abstract": "Invasive hemodynamic monitoring provides essential information for managing acute heart failure (AHF) and cardiogenic shock (CS) patients, aiding circulatory shock phenotyping and in individualized and hemodynamically-based therapeutic management. The hemodynamic trajectory after the initial care bundle has been provided refines prognostication and anticipates hospital outcomes. Invasive hemodynamic monitoring also tracks the clinical response to supportive measures, providing objective background for therapeutic escalation/de-escalation, facilitating titration of vasoactive/temporary mechanical circulatory support (tMCS) to achieve an optimal balance between native heart function and device assistance, and allowing for a repeated reassessment of hemodynamics during the support weaning phase. Therefore, complete hemodynamic assessment (i.e., arterial line, central venous catheter, and pulmonary artery catheter) is recommended for any patient in overt CS; however, we also provide some pragmatic clinical, imaging, and laboratory criteria to identify patients with beginning stages of CS, which could also benefit from complete invasive hemodynamic assessment. The specific hemodynamic phenotypes that can be applied in clinical practice and case-based examples of how the invasive hemodynamic phenotype can change following therapeutic actions are presented to provide pragmatic guidance on invasive hemodynamic monitoring.

Background\n\nAcute heart failure (AHF) is a broad diagnosis encompassing a variety of \ndifferent phenotypes and varying clinical severities, with cardiogenic shock (CS) \nat the extreme of its spectrum. CS often heralds progression to advanced heart \nfailure and requires consideration of cardiac replacement therapies.\n\nAHF is a leading admission diagnosis in contemporary cardiac intensive care \nunits (CICU) [ 1 ], and invasive haemodynamics are obtained in approximately \n30–40% of CICU admissions [ 2 ]. AHF includes any acute cardiac event leading to \nlow cardiac output and/or pulmonary or systemic congestion [ 3 ]. The \npathophysiology and outcomes differ significantly between acute myocardial \ninfarction (AMI)-related AHF, acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF), and de \nnovo non-AMI related AHF, warranting individualized treatments [ 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 ]. \nSubsequently, prognosis of AHF is considerably variable, depending on patient \npre-existing comorbidities, the aetiology of AHF and the clinical severity upon \npresentation. Nevertheless, there is general consensus that clinical and \nhemodynamic trajectory during AHF hospitalization help to identify the leading \nAHF phenotype, predict overall prognosis across different aetiologies and guide \ntherapeutic measures [ 9 , 10 , 11 , 12 , 13 ].\n\nThis review aims to summarize the available technologies and evidence on \nhemodynamic monitoring in AHF, CS, and advanced heart failure, providing \npractical recommendations for its implementation.\n\n2. Invasive Haemodynamic Monitoring\n\n2.1 General Principles of Invasive Monitoring\n\nIn general, invasive monitoring requires fluid-filled catheters, mandating \nproper levelling, zeroing, and damping to ensure accurate pressure readings. The \nintravascular line is connected to a pressure transducer with an automatic \nflushing system (i.e., a pressure bag providing infusion of pressurized saline \ninto the pressure line). Vascular pressure fluctuations cause pulsations in the \nsaline column, displacing the electrical manometer’s diaphragm, which contains a \nstrain gauge based on the Wheatstone bridge principle. This deformation changes \nresistance, which is electronically detected and used to create a waveform \nthrough Fourier analysis. For accurate calibration, the transducer, tubing, and \nflush solution must be correctly assembled, and air bubbles eliminated. The \ntransducer should be positioned at the level of the patient’s right atrium \n[ 14 , 15 , 16 ]. As a rule of thumb, this is identified by a mid-axillary line and 5 cm \nbelow sternal Louis’ angle [ 17 ]. Identification of this level in obese patients \nmay be challenging, and may be deeper than usual.\n\nThe system must be set to “off to patient, open to air” with atmospheric \npressure zeroed by pressing the “zero” button. If the patient’s position \nchanges, the transducer height should be adjusted accordingly. Improper \ncalibration can lead to inaccurate pressure measurements. A snap flush test \ngenerates a square wave to assess system oscillations: one oscillation is \noptimal, two or more indicate an underdamped system, while no oscillations \nsuggest an overdamped system with a slow response; both these pitfalls may lead \nto inaccurate pressure estimation and should be corrected (Fig. 1 ). A summary of \ncurrently available methods for invasive hemodynamic monitoring, and their best \nclinical indications, is reported in Table 1 .\n\n2.2 Arterial Blood Pressure Invasive Monitoring\n\nContinuous arterial blood pressure (ABP) monitoring is critical for patients in \nCICUs with AHF or CS [ 18 ]. This is commonly achieved through radial artery \ncannulation due to its ease of access and low risk of complications, though the \nbrachial and femoral arteries can also be used. ABP monitoring is especially \nindicated for patients with labile blood pressure, anticipated hemodynamic \ninstability, patients in overt CS, requiring vasoactive drugs and/or temporary \nmechanical circulatory support (tMCS), patients with respiratory failure, or \nthose with morbid obesity due to inaccurate non-invasive ABP measurements.\n\nABP lines are useful for titrating vasoactive drugs, analysing arterial blood \ngases, adjusting ventilation settings in mechanically ventilated patients, and \nallowing frequent blood sampling. Moreover, specific waveform morphologies can \nprovide diagnostic clues (e.g., slow rising waves suggest aortic stenosis, pulsus \nalternans may indicate severe left ventricular (LV) failure, pulse pressure variation suggests \nhypovolemia and can predict fluid responsiveness).\n\n2.3 Central Venous Catheter\n\nCentral venous access (CVC) is essential in critically ill patients. It enables \nmeasurement of central venous oxygen saturation (SvcO 2 ), central venous \npressure (CVP), and facilitates frequent blood sampling, as well as multiple \ndrugs administration, including inotropes, vasopressors, sedatives, electrolytes, \nantibiotics and parenteral nutrition as needed. CICU patients with unstable \nhemodynamics, or those on intravenous inotropic agents and/or tMCS, as well as \nthose with anticipated requirement of multiple continuous infusions should \nreceive CVC insertion.\n\n2.4 Pulse-contour Analysis Monitoring Systems\n\nPeripheral arterial waveform analysis serves as the foundation for advanced \nhemodynamic monitoring systems, such as the PiCCO and FloTrac systems, which \nprovide cardiac output (CO) estimates. The PiCCO system (Pulsion Medical Systems, \nMunich, Germany) uses a 2-element Windkessel model to calculate CO, stroke volume \n(SV), and arterial pressure waveform by analysing vessel compliance during \nsystole and diastole. PiCCO combines transpulmonary thermodilution with waveform \nanalysis for pressure readings [ 19 ].\n\nThe FloTrac system (Edwards Lifesciences, Irvine, California) offers continuous \nCO measurement by using pulse rate and SV without requiring recalibration. It \ncontinuously updates hemodynamic parameters such as CO, cardiac index (CI), \nstroke volume variation (SVV), and stroke volume index (SVi). Compared to PiCCO \nand pulmonary artery catheters (PAC), FloTrac provides similar CO readings, \nmaking it a suitable, less invasive alternative. The main advantage of FloTrac is \nits ability to connect to a standard peripheral arterial catheter, and when \ncombined with the Edwards HemoSphere monitor, it displays CO, SV, and SVV [ 20 ].\n\nBoth these methods are limited by the lack of information on pulmonary \ncirculation and by the poor accuracy in CO and SV estimation when tMCS devices \nthat alter arterial waveform morphology are ongoing.\n\n2.5 Pulmonary Artery Catheter\n\nAdvanced invasive hemodynamic monitoring requires right heart catheterization \n(RHC) with the PAC and is frequently necessary at various stages throughout the \nwhole trajectory of heart failure (HF), encompassing both the acute phase of \nhospitalization and the chronic management setting. The integration of advanced \nhemodynamic monitoring into the management of HF patients ensures precise, \ndata-driven decision-making, enhancing the ability to tailor therapies to the \nindividual patient’s hemodynamic profile, especially in case of symptoms \nrefractory to medical therapies or disproportionate to objective data. Moreover, \ninvasive hemodynamic data are mandatory to guide clinical decision making for \nleft ventricular assist device (LVAD) therapy and heart transplantation in more \nadvanced stages. Basically, vascular access for RHC is usually obtained via the \ninternal jugular, subclavian or femoral vein under safe ultrasound guidance. \nRight jugular vein is the preferred vascular access for bedside catheterization \nbecause the balloon-tipped catheter is more naturally directed toward the \npulmonary artery without the need for fluoroscopy [ 21 ]. The PAC is then advanced \nthrough the right heart and up to the pulmonary artery to obtain CVP, right \nventricular (RV) pressure, pulmonary artery pressures (PAP) (systolic, diastolic, \nmean), and pulmonary artery wedge pressure (PAWP). Ideally, pressure should be \nrecorded at end-expiration, i.e., at the functional residual capacity, to avoid \nthe impact of intrathoracic and pleural pressure swings, irrespective to the mode \nof ventilation (spontaneous vs. positive-pressure ventilation) [ 21 ]. Significant \nrespiratory variations of intrathoracic pressure can be observed in patients with \nchronic lung disease and severe obesity, in this case average values over the \nentire respiratory cycle may better approximate intravascular pressures [ 22 ]. CO \ncan be calculated using either direct methods (direct Fick and thermodilution) or \nthe indirect Fick method and divided by body surface area (BSA) to obtain CI \n[ 21 ]. The direct Fick method for CO determination is assumed as the gold standard \ntechnique but requires direct measurement of the whole-body oxygen consumption \n(VO 2 ) and is not often available, especially in the CICU setting [ 21 ]. This \nlimitation has led to the development of indirect Fick method, that combines \ndirect measurement of mixed venous saturation (SvO 2 ) from the pulmonary \nartery (PA), arterial saturation (SaO 2 ) from arterial blood sampling and \nhaemoglobin concentration with the VO 2 values estimated based on nomograms; \nhowever these nomograms assume a “normal” physiology and may not be accurate in \nAHF and CS patients. Currently, thermodilution-based CO is the preferred method \nin the CICU department and when direct VO 2 measurements cannot be obtained. \nNoteworthy, thermodilution CO is unreliable in the setting intracardiac shunt and \nmay be affected—on a minor extent—also by severe tricuspid regurgitation \n[ 21 , 23 ]. In addition to direct haemodynamic parameters, several derived \nparameters can be obtained from PAC [ 24 ] (a complete summary is reported in Table 2 (Ref. [ 12 , 24 , 25 , 26 , 27 , 28 , 29 , 30 , 31 , 32 , 33 , 34 , 35 , 36 , 37 , 38 ])). Among derived indexes, admission cardiac power output \n(CPO) and cardiac power index (CPI) have been shown to be strongly associated \nwith in-hospital mortality in CS patients and can be set as hemodynamic goals to \nmonitor treatment effectiveness. CPO is typically expressed in Watts by dividing \nthe product of mean arterial pressure (MAP) and CO by 451 and provides a measure \nof combined (left and right) ventricular power [ 25 , 26 , 27 , 28 , 29 , 30 ].\n\n2.6 Artificial Intelligence\n\nThe amount of data generated by the instantaneous sampling obtained with the \ninvasive monitoring systems provide an ideal substrate for artificial \nintelligence (AI) analysis. Dedicated, AI algorithms have been developed and \nintegrated with hemodynamic monitoring platforms to predict adverse \nevents—e.g., systemic hypotension—and allow for pre-emptive interventions. \nFor example, the proprietary Edwards Lifesciences Hypotension Prediction Index \n(HPI) leverages on a dedicated arterial waveform sensor (Flotrac IQ) and a \nmonitor (HemoSphere) to warn the clinician 5–15 minutes prior to hypotensive \nevents [ 39 ]. This also system classifies hypotension events are related to \nimpaired preload, afterload, and contractility, allowing for tailored upstream \nstrategies. The HPI system, coupled with a pre-specified treatment protocol, was \nable to reduce intraoperative hypotension episode during non-cardiac surgery \n[ 40 ]. Similarly, application of AI machine learning techniques to large datasets \ncombining hemodynamic, metabolic, and clinical information yielded accurate tools \nto predict CS when applied to at-risk patients [ 41 ], and to cluster different \nphenotypes within the CS population [ 42 ]. However, implementation of these \nprotocol in the AHF patients is still limited, as they rely also on \nnon-hemodynamic variables, they are not incorporated in a monitoring platform, \nand were generated from potentially not enough granular data [ 43 ]. In addition, \nspecific arterial waveform alterations induced by tMCS could dramatically mislead \nalgorithms based on waveform analysis, like the HPI.\n\n3. Invasive Haemodynamic Monitoring in Acute Heart Failure at Risk of \nCS\n\nDuring the past decades, both observational studies and clinical trial have \nquestioned the utility of a routine bedside invasive haemodynamic monitoring with \nPAC among a wide range of critically ill patients due to neutral or negative \nimpact on clinical outcomes, leading to a notable decline in its use [ 44 , 45 , 46 , 47 ]. \nHowever, these studies suffered from several limitations, including patient \nselection and lack of standardized protocols in therapeutic adjustment in \nresponse to information provided by the PAC [ 48 ]. In the setting of AHF not yet \ncomplicated by CS, the challenge lies in understanding the severity of the \nclinical picture and the true risk of in-hospital worsening and which patient \ncould benefit from PAC insertion.\n\nThe landmark Evaluation Study of Congestive Heart Failure and Pulmonary Artery \nCatheterization Effectiveness (ESCAPE) trial failed to demonstrate that, among \npatients hospitalized for ADHF, a routine use of PAC to adjust decongestive and \nvasoactive therapies was superior to a therapeutic approach guided by clinical \nassessment alone, with similar results in terms of length of index \nhospitalization and mortality and higher incidence of adverse events in the PAC \ngroup [ 49 ]. However, ADHF patients often linger some time on a “beginning” CS \nstate (i.e., CS stage B according to the Society for Cardiovascular Angiography \nand Interventions (SCAI) classification, see below) and > 50% of admission SCAI \nB patients worsen to more severe shock states at 24 hours [ 50 ]. In addition, ADHF \npatients with long-standing cardiac dysfunction exhibit the highest tolerance to \nlow CO, so that even a severe hemodynamic compromise may be masked by falsely \nreassuring blood pressure and normal lactate as a result of chronically and \ndisproportionally elevated systemic vascular resistances (SVR), pre-existing \nhypertension, and higher O 2 extraction from end-organs [ 51 , 52 ]: this may \nresult in under-recognition and undertreatment of hypoperfusion. Indeed, reduced \nSvO 2 —rather than serum lactate—may be a better gauge of end-organ \nperfusion in this group. Therefore, hemodynamic indexes obtained with PAC offer \nan earlier window for CS diagnosis and intervention. In these patients PAC \ninsertion may in fact unveil a profound low flow state and trigger therapeutic \nchanges in up to 70% of the cases [ 52 ], and is associated to higher use of \ndownstream advanced heart failure therapies [ 53 ]. These patients may be amenable \nto early supportive vasoactive therapies (e.g., sodium nitroprusside, nitrates) \nor even intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) therapy [ 6 ]. Indeed, IABP, which \nsignificantly reduces LV afterload but only modestly increases CO, may be most \neffective in clinical situations where there is a disproportionate increase in \nafterload without severe hemodynamic compromise like in the SCAI B ADHF setting. \nSeveral hemodynamic indexes identify patients who would dramatically benefit from \nIABP in ADHF, i.e., elevated SVR, isolated LV or biventricular dysfunction, \npulmonary circulation congestion, inadequate response to initial diuretic therapy \nand regular non-tachycardic heart rhythm. In addition, patients with ADHF may \nfeature variable degrees of concomitant functional mitral regurgitation (MR), of \nmoderate or severe grade in approximately 60% of the cases [ 54 ]. Modulation of \nMR severity (by either pharmacologic vasodilators or IABP) may easily be \nquantified by looking at the PAWP waveform [ 55 ], where large reductions of \npreviously prominent v-waves indicate a good response to vasodilatation, thus \nalso helping in choosing between goal-directed medical therapy (GDMT) \nintensification or MR interventional correction. Finally, PAC may also confirm \nthe efficacy of transitioning from i.v. to oral vasodilator therapy [ 56 , 57 ].\n\nIdentification of ADHF patients who benefit from PAC is challenging but some \nsimple clinical variables may suggest an underlying severe hemodynamic \nderangement: sinus tachycardia; serum lactate ≥ 2 mmol/L; frequent \nventricular arrhythmias; hepatorenal injury on blood tests; SvcO 2 < 60% or \na veno-arterial pCO 2 gap > 6 mmHg [ 38 ]. Bedside, noninvasive echodynamic \nassessment can also trigger invasive hemodynamic monitoring based on the \nfollowing markers: reduced LV stroke volume (left ventricular outflow tract \nvelocity-time integral, left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) velocity-time integral (VTI) < 9 cm), RV dysfunction (tricuspid annular \nplane systolic excursion < 17 mm—tricuspid annulus s’ velocity at tissue \nDoppler < 9 cm/s), severe increase in RV afterload (systolic PAP > 50 mmHg, and \nsevere estimated systemic congestion (CVP > 15 mmHg) [ 58 ]. Presence of one \nor—more commonly—more of these criteria should prompt consideration of PAC \ninsertion. This also underscores the pivotal \nrole of echocardiography in identifying candidates for PAC insertion: \nechocardiography is indeed a powerful and reliable tool to non-invasively \nestimate hemodynamics and should always be performed as a first-line assessment \nin the AHF patient.\n\nHemodynamic compromise may—on the opposite—be more obvious in AMI-related \nAHF, as these patients lack chronic compensatory mechanisms. Patients with \nextensive antero-lateral AMI, with severe depression of the LV function, and with \nmechanical complications are at significant risk of CS. These criteria, along \nwith elevated serum lactate, sinus tachycardia, acute pulmonary edema at \npresentation, recurrent ventricular arrhythmias should prompt PAC use \nconsideration for subsequent management [ 59 ]. At the time of percutaneous \ncoronary intervention (PCI), direct measurement of left ventricular end-diastolic \npressure (LVEDP) with the use of a pig-tail catheter can aid in identifying \npatients who may benefit from LV micro-axial flow pump (mAFP) unloading.\n\nIn general, regardless of AHF etiology, any patient who fails to stabilize with \nthe initial therapeutic measures should be considered for PAC insertions and \ninvasive hemodynamic assessment. In addition, the specific limitations of each \nmonitoring device mentioned in Table 1 , should be considered for optimal tool \nselection. A pragmatic algorithm to identify the best monitoring configuration \nwithin the AHF and CS spectrum is reported in Fig. 2 .\n\n4. Invasive Haemodynamic Monitoring in Overt CS\n\nPatients with CS have been conventionally excluded from clinical trials on PAC \nuse. Recently, several observational studies evaluating association between PAC \nuse and short-term outcomes among patients with cardiogenic shock have been \nreleased [ 53 , 60 , 61 , 62 , 63 , 64 ]. Notably, hospital practice still substantially accounts for \nthe variability observed in PAC adoption [ 65 ]. Hernandez et al . [ 63 ] \nconducted a large registry-based study collecting retrospective data with the use \nof the National Inpatient Sample database (NIS) in the US from 2004 to 2014, \nincluding more than 9 million of patients with a primary diagnosis of HF or who \ndeveloped CS during the index hospitalization. The study demonstrated a higher \nmortality among patients with HF receiving PAC (9.9% vs. 3.3%), although the \nexcess of mortality declined over time during the years of the study. \nParadoxically, the use of PAC in the setting of CS was associated with improved \noutcomes (in-hospital mortality 35.1% in the PAC group vs. no-PAC 39.2%, OR \n0.91; p < 0.001) [ 55 ]. Noteworthy, the increasing use of tMCS for CS \nrepresents an expanding indication for PAC [ 59 ], and tMCS use explains much of \nthe variability observed in PAC adoption [ 66 ]. O’Neill et al . [ 62 ] \nperformed a sub-analysis of the Impella IQ US registry including patients \nadmitted with a diagnosis of AMI-CS and receiving tMCS with the Impella devices. In \nthis study, the use of PAC for haemodynamic monitoring was found to be associated \nwith better survival [ 62 ]. More recently, Garan et al . [ 64 ] collected retrospective \ndata from the first eight sites contributing to the Cardiogenic Shock Working \nGroup (CSWG) in the US from 2016 to 2019. The main cause for CS was ADHF, \nfollowed by AMI-CS [ 64 ]. The Authors found that early (prior to tMCS initiation) \nand complete invasive haemodynamic profiling with PAC was associated with lower \nin-hospital mortality as compared to having incomplete or no PAC assessment, \nacross each SCAI stage sub-cohort, even after accounting for potentially \nconfounding factors, and this difference was more pronounced among patients with \ngreater degrees of haemodynamic compromise (SCAI D and E patients). This was true \nboth for the AMI-CS and ADHF-CS cohorts. The currently ongoing Pulmonary Artery \nCatheter in Cardiogenic Shock Trial (PACCS trial; NCT05485376 ) will test whether \nPAC use in ADHF-CS would lead to lower hospital mortality. However, given the \nlack of high-quality evidence current guidelines do not support a systematic use \nof advanced haemodynamic monitoring in CS, limiting the use of PAC for the most \nsevere cases and those who fail to respond to initial therapy or in cases of \ndiagnostic or therapeutic uncertainty [ 18 , 67 ].\n\nAny patient presenting in overt CS should receive an arterial pressure line, and \na central venous catheter and the addition of PAC should be strongly considered \n(Fig. 2 ). Indeed, the SCAI/Heart Failure Society of America 2017 expert consensus \ndocument recommends invasive haemodynamic monitoring and PAC-derived data for \nseveral purposes including (1) timely diagnosis and classification of CS based on \nthe haemodynamic profile, (2) choice and management of supportive measures \nincluding pharmacological interventions and haemodynamic-based tMCS selection, \n(3) haemodynamic-based patient management during tMCS, (4) escalation of tMCS \naccording to haemodynamic data, (5) weaning and eventually withdrawal of \npharmacological and tMCS in patients with myocardial recovery and, (6) assessment \nfor candidacy to advanced HF therapies, including durable tMCS and heart \ntransplantation, in those who fail to recover from myocardial injury [ 67 ]. The \nmany goals of invasive hemodynamic monitoring are summarized in Fig. 3 .\n\n4.1 Haemodynamic Classification of CS\n\nSince the ground-breaking research by Forrester et al . [ 68 ] on \nphenotyping of AMI-CS patients, the role of medical treatment guided by the \npatient’s hemodynamic profile has been incorporated into diagnostic and \ntherapeutic algorithms of CS. This study resulted in the creation of the renowned \nForrester classification [ 68 ]. This classification links PAWP to CI to categorize \npatients according to their congestion (dry vs. wet) and perfusion status (cold \nvs. warm), with significant prognostic and therapeutic implications.Historically, patients with CS were categorized as having a low CI ≤ 2.2 \nL/min/m 2 (cold) and a high PAWP ≥ 18 mmHg (wet) leading to the classic \n“cold and wet” profile, which still represents the most frequent CS phenotype \nin the AMI-CS group accounting for nearly two-thirds in the SHOCK trial \npopulation and the group at highest in-hospital mortality [ 68 , 69 ]. Subsequent \nanalysis of the SHOCK trial along with the extensive use of invasive haemodynamic \nmonitoring led to a more nuanced spectrum of CS haemodynamics. In this regard, up \nto one-third of patients with AMI-CS have signs of tissue hypoperfusion without \npulmonary congestion at presentation (euvolemic CS corresponding to a “cold and \ndry” profile), with similar ominous prognosis [ 70 ]. Although sustained \nhypotension is typically required to define classic CS, \nthere is an increasingly recognized subgroup of \npre-cardiogenic shock patients who experience either isolated hypoperfusion \nwithout hypotension (due to abnormally elevated SVR) or relative hypotension \nwithout hypoperfusion, with hypoperfusion portending worse outcomes that \nhypotension [ 71 ]. This has led to the proposal of the concept of “normotensive \nCS”, which warrants timely diagnosis given its ominous prognosis—similar to \nthat of overt CS—if unrecognized [ 71 , 72 ]. Conversely, patients with isolated \nhypotension or with relative hypotension ( > 30 mmHg drop from baseline) would be \nlabelled as “beginning” CS (i.e., SCAI stage B) [ 66 ].\n\nMoreover, there has been growing recognition of systemic inflammatory response \n(SIRS) as a pathophysiological consequence of the CS cascade [ 73 ], characterized \nby microvascular disfunction and uncoupling of the micro- and microcirculation, \nleading to inappropriate peripheral profound vasodilation [ 74 ] and worsening \nend-organ damage. These patients may feature a “warm and wet” profile. SIRS \nassociates with worse CS severity and higher mortality [ 73 ]. Early data from \nSHOCK trial revealed that SIRS may be present in up to 20% AMI-CS patients: these \npatients had lower SVR that those with CS without SIRS, consistent with a \nsuperimposed distributive-inflammatory phenotype, i.e., “mixed” shock (MS) \n[ 75 ]. Coherently, MS is reported at a rate of 20–25% of all shock admissions \n[ 1 , 76 ]. We recently proposed a standardized definition of MS leveraging on \nlongitudinal variations in hemodynamic and SIRS markers, where an increase in CI \nand/or decrease in systemic vascular resistances index (SVRi) along with increase in serum lactate and need of \nvasodilators downtitration/need of vasopressor support would provide the \nhemodynamic hallmark of ensuing vasodilatation and should be coupled with \nleucocytosis or leukopenia, increase in C-reactive protein, very high SvO 2 , \nfever or hypothermia as markers of inflammation [ 76 ]. These criteria identified a \nMS rate of 24.5% among patients with a primary diagnosis of CS and portended \nworse in-hospital prognosis. PAC helps to identify early this trajectory, \nproviding real-time tracking of the relevant hemodynamic variables. Notably, MS \ncriteria were met at a median time of 120 hours following CS diagnosis, implying \nthat only extended invasive monitoring would capture these events [ 76 ].\n\nThe fourth “dry and warm” haemodynamic profile includes pure vasodilatory \nshock (defined by high CI, low SVR, low PAWP), and euvolemia (defined by normal \nCI, SVR, and PAWP).\n\nHemodynamic CS definitions in clinical practice guidelines and clinical trials \ninclude persistent hypotension (systolic blood pressure < 90 mmHg for > 30 min \nor need of supports to maintain SBP > 90 mmHg) with low CO/CI (CI < 1.8 \nL/min/m 2 without support or < 2.2 L/min/m 2 with support), and normal \nor elevated filling pressures (i.e., central venous CVP > 12–14 mmHg and PAWP > 15–18 mmHg [ 18 ]. Schematically, according to invasive hemodynamics CS can be \nfurther classified as LV-dominant (low CI, high PAWP, low CVP), RV-dominant (low \nCI, low PAWP, high CVP) and biventricular-shock (low CI, high PAWP, high CVP). \nThe CSWG proposed a threshold of 18 mmHg for PAWP and 12 mmHg for CVP [ 24 ]. Data \nfor the SHOCK trial and from the CSWG demonstrated that biventricular involvement \nis present in 40–50% of CS patients [ 24 , 77 ].\n\nIn 2019 a multidisciplinary group of experts convened by the SCAI was assembled \nto derive a simple and intuitive classification schema for CS including five \nstages of increasing shock severity labelled from A (“at risk”) to E \n(“extremis”) based on clinical findings, biochemical markers and haemodynamic \ndata [ 78 , 79 ]. The Authors emphasized the dynamic nature of the SCAI \nclassification, with a patient that may start as a SCAI B stage (i.e., \nhypotensive without clinical and biochemical signs of hypoperfusion) and then \nworsen over time to a higher stage. Conversely, patients may also stabilize and \nimprove from worse to better CS stages [ 79 ]. In this context, real-time data from \ninvasive haemodynamic could timely inform about patient transition between \nstages: for example, PAC may demonstrate early—in a previously hypotensive, \nnon-hypoperfused patient—a drop in CI, SvO 2 and increase in PAWP, marking \na transition from a SCAI B to a SCAI C CS stage).\n\nMost commonly adopted CS classifications are summarized in Fig. 4 .\n\n4.2 Haemodynamic-Based Interventions and Hemodynamic Monitoring \nDuring tMCS\n\nOnce CS is diagnosed, the primary treatment goal is to timely restore end-organ \nperfusion while preventing the escalation of myocardial oxygen demand and \nischemia. Despite advancements in diagnostics and therapeutics, CS remains a \nheterogeneous and complex clinical syndrome often managed with a \n“one-size-fits-all” approach, which may not consider individual variability in \nresponse to specific medical interventions. In this context, invasive hemodynamic \nmonitoring can aid in supportive measures selection and provide objective, \nreal-time data on the effectiveness of initial therapeutic measures, including \npharmacological support with inotropes and/or vasoactive drugs, or tMCS [ 80 , 81 ] \n(Fig. 4 ). According to the ventricular dysfunction profile (i.e., \nRV-dominant, LV-dominant or biventricular CS) [ 18 , 66 ] and the clinical severity \nbased on the SCAI stage classification and the degree of hemodynamic compromise, \nthe proper support is selected (favouring more potent devices for more profound \ndegrees of haemodynamic failure) [ 81 , 82 ]. Degree of concomitant respiratory \nfailure and ventricular arrhythmia are also considered to select the most \nappropriate tMCS, as refractory cardiac arrest due to unstable rhythms and severe \nrespiratory compromise are amenable to veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane \noxygenation (V-A ECMO) support only [ 81 ].\n\nOnce the chosen supportive measure has been started, a continuous and multimodal \nmonitoring approach is warranted [ 83 , 84 ]. The combined use of various monitoring \ntools, including bed-side trans-thoracic or trans-oesophageal echocardiography \n(TTE/TEE), biomarkers and end-organ assessment with invasive haemodynamic \nparameters provides the most comprehensive assessment of the cardiovascular \nfunction [ 84 , 85 ]. Whereas a non-invasive hemodynamic assessment approach based on \nDoppler-derived estimations of pressures and flow with TTE/TEE has been shown an \nacceptable agreement with invasive haemodynamics [ 86 ], these measurements are \nepisodic rather than continuous and we favour the use of PAC that supplies \ncontinuous haemodynamic data. Notably, the predictive value of hemodynamic \nvariables and the discriminative ability of CS staging systems improve after \nsupportive measures have started and a 24 hour re-assessment time window seems \nwarranted to accurately track patient trajectory, highlighting the dynamic nature \nof CS and the impact of early care [ 11 , 28 , 87 , 88 ]. Thus we recommend that PAC should \nthus be left in place for the first days of therapy and at least for the duration \nof tMCS [ 81 ]. During tMCS, repeated assessment of native heart function, right and \nleft ventricular interplay and end-organ perfusion is mandatory to optimize pump \nflow [ 66 , 81 , 82 , 83 ]. CO and CI provide an absolute estimate of the composite (device \nplus native heart) systemic flow. Parallelly, SvO 2 can inform about the \nadequacy of total flow for the physiological demand of peripheral tissues [ 89 ]. \nStatic pressures (including CVP and PAWP) confirm adequate ventricular unloading \nand track effective decongestion. In this framework, continuous PAC monitoring \ncan guide further escalation/de-escalation of supports and monitor haemodynamic \ntrends or responses to therapeutic interventions (i.e., increased pump \nflow/insertion of additional tMCS, titration of inotropic drugs or vasodilators, \nmodulation of diuretic therapy). This is particularly valuable for \ncontinuous-flow devices: for example, the left-sided mAFP are highly \npreload-dependent, and warrant continuous assessment of the RV function and of LV \nfilling to avoid suction events, which can cause haemolysis and/or hypotension \n[ 90 , 91 ]. Therefore, PAWP is a key parameter to assess the degree of pulmonary \nvenous congestion and to estimate the LVEDP and thus LV preload [ 92 , 93 ], \nreflecting both the adequacy of LV decongestion/unloading and aiding the user to \nadjust the mAFP P-level or the V-A ECMO flow. Mean PAWP provides a measure of \nleft atrium (and pulmonary) loading throughout the cardiac cycle, while \nend-diastolic PAWP (a-wave) provides a surrogate measure of LVEDP and—thus—of \nLV unloading. For example, a patient with a normal PAWP a-wave but increased mean \nPAWP due to giant v-wave (likely due to significant mitral regurgitation) would \nnot benefit from increased mAFP speed or over-diuresis: indeed, these actions may \nexcessively decrease the LV preload leading to suction events and hypotension.\n\nGiven the reappraisal of RV failure in several acute cardiac illness [ 77 , 94 ], \nseveral parameters have been developed for selective evaluation of RV function. \nAmong these, CVP to PAWP ratio is commonly used. Normally, CVP is significantly \nlower than PAWP; a CVP/PAWP ratio above > 0.86 suggests a failing RV in the \nsetting of AMI-CS [ 32 , 95 ]. The pulmonary artery pulsatility index [PAPi = \n(systolic PAP – diastolic PAP)/CVP] is a reliable marker of RV function across a \nvariety of AHF etiologies. A PAPi < 0.9 in AMI-CS and < 2.0 in ADHF-CS \nindicates significantly impaired RV function and may suggest the need for \npharmacological or mechanical RV support [ 34 , 96 ] (Table 2 ). Recently, markers of \npulsatile RV afterload (i.e., pulmonary artery elastance, PaE and pulmonary \nartery compliance, PaC) have been shown to be powerful prognosticators in CS and \nin pulmonary hypertension [ 12 , 97 , 98 ]: these indexes combine flow and pressure \nmeasures, providing a comprehensive assessment of ventriculo-arterial coupling. \nIndividually or in combination, these parameters can inform the user about the \nfilling status and the degree of RV dysfunction suggesting for the need for fluid \nmanagement strategies (i.e., fluid administration, diuretic therapy or renal \nreplacement therapy) or the need for either pharmacological or mechanical RV \nsupport [ 94 ]. For example, for a patient receiving tMCS with isolated left-sided \npercutaneous ventricular assist device (pVAD) for biventricular CS (high CVP, \nhigh PAWP, and low CI), the evidence of a steep drop of both CVP and PAWP with a \nconcomitant CI increase after pVAD initiation would suggest effective LV \nunloading with subsequent reduction in RV afterload (i.e., PAWP) and secondary RV \nimprovement and CVP decrease. On the other hand, the evidence of a mild reduction \nof both PAWP and CVP after left-sided pVAD insertion and despite P-level \ntitration would suggest residual volume overload and the need for aggressive \ndiuretic therapy or even for renal replacement therapy (RRT) in case of \ninadequate decongestion; alternatively, if also lactate fail to normalize and CI \nand SvO 2 do not improve this may prompt tMCS escalation to more powerful \ndevice. Moreover, in patients already on left-sided pVAD, PAC can aid to assess \nwhether the RV is capable of keeping up with flow from the left-sided pVAD: \ndramatic decline in PAWP coupled with increasing CVP, low PAP and suction alarms \nmay suggest worsening RV failure. This, in turn, may trigger supportive measures \nfor RV failure, including inotropic titration, inhaled nitric oxide, tMCS \nescalation (with addition of Impella RP, veno-pulmonary ECMO or V-A ECMO). \nFinally, in patients receiving biventricular support with pVAD (BiPella) or with \nVA-ECMO combined with Impella (ECPella) the optimization of each device speed \nrelative to the other is facilitated by PAC, as it provides essential information \non PAP and PAWP and thus on ventricular interdependence.\n\nCurrent guidelines also strongly recommend strict haemodynamic monitoring in \npatients on V-A ECMO [ 84 ]. In this setting, the thermodilution method is not \nsuitable for CO and SvO 2 assessment due to reduced trans-pulmonary flow \nleading to inaccurate readings [ 84 ]. Peripheral oxygenation may be normal despite \nsevere pulmonary oedema due to oxygenated V-A ECMO flow, but oxygenation in the \nupper body may differ from that of the lower body (differential hypoxaemia). \nVenous blood passing through injured lungs would return deoxygenated to the LV \nand could be ejected in the systemic circulation. Monitoring of these patients \nrequires oximetry preferentially from the right arm; since the retrograde V-A \nECMO arterial flow mixes with the native heart flow at a variable level in the \nthoracic aorta (watershed level) depending on competing residual LV ejection, a \nreduced right arm SaO 2 suggests desaturated blood flow from LV to the right \nbrachio-cefalic trunk and subsequent risk of cerebral hypoxaemia. Measuring \nSaO 2 from the left arm only would miss cases where the watershed is more \nproximal to the aortic root and desaturated blood would only flow to the right \nbrachio-cefalic trunk. In V-A ECMO, together with bedside echocardiography, \ninvasive hemodynamic monitoring with PAC allows for the assessment of PAWP trend, \nwhich is an indirect index of LV overload and distention. For example, once \nVA-ECMO has been started the evidence of increasing PAWP together with low aortic \npulsatility, pulmonary congestion on chest X-ray and LV distension with minimal \nor no aortic valve opening on bedside echocardiography would suggest the \npotential need for pharmacologic (inotropes, vasodilators) or mechanical (IABP, \nmAFP) venting strategies [ 99 , 100 , 101 ].\n\n4.3 Weaning and Liberation From tMCS\n\nAt present, no standardized device-specific weaning and explant protocols have \nbeen proposed or evaluated. Hence, in the absence of clinical practice \nguidelines, a weaning trial should be intended as a deliberate and controlled \nreduction in tMCS to evaluate the intrinsic native heart function’s capacity to \nprovide the necessary circulatory support to match the body’s demands. This \nconcept should be intended as the evidence of an improvement of native heart \nfunction sufficient to meet haemodynamic and metabolic tissues demands and not \nnecessarily as a full restoration of pre-tMCS cardiac function. Although there \nare device-specific considerations for weaning and explant strategies of tMCS, \ncriteria for readiness to wean and eventually explant include the stability of a \nset of clinical, hemodynamic, metabolic, echocardiographic and end-organ \nperfusion variables at the lowest level of tMCS [ 80 , 102 , 103 ]. Weaning process is \nusually considered after objective improvement of end-organ function and \nperfusion (e.g., lactate < 2 mmol/L, normalized SvO 2 , improving trend of \ntransaminases, bilirubin, INR, creatinine), adequate oxygenation and ventilation \non ABG at spontaneous breathing or with minimal pressure-support ventilation \n(end-expiratory pressure ≤ 5 cmH 2 O, peak inspiratory pressure ≤ 15 cmH 2 O; FiO 2 ≤ 0.5), minimal vasoactive drugs \nrequirement (we usually consider a vasoactive inotropic score threshold ≤ 10 [ 104 ]). In addition, several hemodynamic criteria should be met prior \nto weaning attempt, including: a MAP > 65 mmHg with good arterial pulsatility, \nnative CI > 2.2 L/min/m 2 , CVP < 12 mmHg and PAWP < 18 mmHg [ 80 ]. If most \nof the abovementioned parameters are met, a trial of tMCS weaning can be \nattempted, usually by reducing device support with a device-specific protocol \n(i.e., reducing in a stepwise fashion the pump speed to lower P-level for \nImpella, placing in standby mode or attempting a volume and/or ratio weaning to \n1:2 or 1:3 for IABP, reducing pump speed to achieve a lower flow for V-A ECMO) \n[ 80 , 102 ]. Moreover, the same set of haemodynamic, metabolic and \nechocardiographic variables should be strictly re-evaluated after any tMCS \nintensity step-down. On the other hand, if multiple weaning attempts fail \n(indicating device dependency), one should resume or escalate tMCS, addressing \nreversible factors, and eventually consider advanced therapies or palliative care \noptions [ 80 , 102 ].\n\n5. Invasive Hemodynamic Monitoring in Advanced Heart Failure and Heart \nReplacement Therapies\n\nAdvanced heart failure (AdvHF) is essentially a clinical diagnosis, and several \ncriteria have been proposed (I NEED HELP and Heart Failure Association-European Society of Cardiology (HFA-ESC) criteria): in general, these \ncriteria leverage on the history of multiple hospitalization, loss of therapy \ntolerance, and end-organ damage that characterize the condition. These criteria \nidentify a high-risk population and offer some prognostication, as overall \nsurvival is worse with increasing number of criteria met [ 105 , 106 ]. Therefore, \nAdvHF does not need a hemodynamic diagnosis, but invasive hemodynamic monitoring \nis nevertheless essential in its management, especially in the following \nscenarios, peculiar of the AdHF cohort.\n\n5.1 Heart Replacement Therapies Evaluation\n\nAdvHF patients may be hospitalized due to ADHF-CS, and this may be a harbinger \nfor the need of heart replacement therapies (HRT) [ 4 , 105 ]. Evaluation of patient \ncandidacy to heart transplant (HTx) or LVAD requires invasive hemodynamic \nevaluation. Current guidelines recommend screening for pulmonary hypertension \nwith PAC every 3–6 months prior to HTx listing and while on HTx waitlist with \nthe aim to rule out irreversible pulmonary hypertension [ 107 ]. In addition, in \ncase of systolic PAP ≥ 50 mmHg, a trans-pulmonary gradient ≥ 15 mmHg, \npulmonary vascular resistances > 3 WU and systolic arterial pressure > 85 mmHg, \na vasodilatory challenge is warranted [ 107 ]. Intensive therapy with vasodilators, \ninotrope and/or IABP may be considered in case of persistent pulmonary \nhypertension despite vasodilator challenge with a repeat invasive assessment \nwithin 24–48 hours. If all the previous actions fail, implant of durable LVAD is \nan option [ 6 , 107 ], and repeat hemodynamic profiling shall be obtained 3–6 months \nafter implantation [ 107 ].\n\nSimilarly, invasive assessment helps to rule out significant or latent RV \nfailure, that may complicate LVAD implantation and long-term course [ 108 ]. The \nfollowing indexes denote a higher risk of post-operative right heart failure: \nCVP/PAWP ≥ 0.63 [ 33 ]; PAPi < 1.85 [ 35 ] or < 2.00 [ 36 ]; RVSWi ≤ 0.25 \nmmHg L/m 2 [ 109 ] and a PaE ≥ 1.16 mmHg/mL [ 110 ] (Table 2 ).\n\n5.2 After Heart Replacement Therapies\n\nImplementation of durable HRT mandates careful patient follow-up. With the \nadvent of new-generation fully magnetically levitated LVAD, the rate of \nhemocompatibility-related adverse event has significantly abated [ 111 ]. \nParallelly, increasing durability of LVAD support confronts us with higher \nincidence of hemodynamic-related adverse events (HDRE) [ 112 ], including aortic \nregurgitation and RV failure: both these conditions are fostered by, but at the \nsame time beget suboptimal hemodynamics. In addition, the RV is exquisitely \nsensitive to both insufficient and excessive unloading of the LV, as both pose \nunfavorable consequences on this chamber. Currently, despite optimized GDMT, a \nsubstantial proportion of LVAD patients shows abnormal resting hemodynamics [ 113 ] \nand systematic use of PAC along with echocardiography helps in achieving optimal \nhemodynamics [ 114 ], this holds especially true if an LVAD patient is hospitalized \nfor AHF. Notably, achievement of optimal hemodynamics during LVAD associates with \nlower rates of hospitalization [ 115 ]. When LVAD is implanted in patients with \npulmonary hypertension not responsive to vasodilator challenge, repeat \nhemodynamics shall be obtained 3–6 months after implantation to assess whether \nprolonged mechanical unloading has reversed the pulmonary hypertension (see \nabove).\n\n6. Invasive Hemodynamic Monitoring Implementation in Clinical Practice\n\nAs outlined, select clinical setting may warrant consideration of invasive \nhemodynamic monitoring over non-invasive monitoring as this may yield better \nphenotyping and improve clinical outcomes. These include: overt CS especially \nwith anticipated/ongoing tMCS use [ 53 , 60 , 61 , 62 , 63 , 64 ], mixed/unclear shock phenotypes [ 76 ], \ninconsistent findings from non-invasive assessment, and AdvAHF patients evaluated \nfor HRT. However, implementation of invasive hemodynamic monitoring should take \ninto account the associated costs and is subject to heterogeneous availability. \nIndeed, PAC is more often used at academic, tertiary centers [ 116 ], and this may \ndepend both on variable local protocols and tool availability. From a healthcare \nperspective, based on hospitalizations data after 2016, use of PAC does not seem \nto increase—and may actually reduce—hospitalization costs when used for \npatients with CS [ 117 ], as opposed to the findings from older reports [ 118 ]. When \ncompared to PiCCO system, the PAC appears less cost-effective, however, direct \ncomparisons are difficult to obtain, as these estimates were based on old \nsurgical and septic shock patients studies [ 119 , 120 ]. Therefore, in \nresource-limited settings, PiCCO may provide a reasonable first-line alternative \nto PAC (provided reliability of the arterial waveform and no tMCS use), but the \nPAC—if available—hould nevertheless be considered whenever a patient fails to \nstabilize with the initial therapies [ 81 ].\n\nFinally, PAC use is backed by weak recommendations from society guidelines [ 81 ] \nand several gaps in evidence remain open for future research, including: \nrandomized trials demonstrating its clinical efficacy, detailed understanding of \nhow PAC measures should inform clinical decision making, role of AI predictive \nalgorithms in the management of the AHF/CS patient and integration of PAC data in \nthe device-specific tMCS weaning process.\n\n7. Conclusions\n\nInvasive hemodynamic monitoring has several goals in the CICU patients and along \nthe whole HF trajectory, as it allows for precise hemodynamic phenotyping, \nindividualized supportive measures selection, traces the trajectory of the \npatient after the initial bundle of care, and prompts treatment escalation and \nde-escalation. In the AHF setting, systematic use of invasive hemodynamics is \nwarranted when overt CS develops and should also be considered as an adjunctive \ntool in AHF patients when impending deterioration is anticipated or inconclusive \nfindings result from non-invasive evaluation. Finally, in advanced HF invasive \nhemodynamic is mandatory for HRT candidacy and should be reassessed periodically \nas an essential tool of the patient follow-up. A wider adoption of hemodynamic \nmonitoring can be envisioned, calling for future research to improve monitoring \ntools design and technology, incorporate artificial intelligence features and to \ninform successful clinical decision making based on hemodynamic assessment.",
