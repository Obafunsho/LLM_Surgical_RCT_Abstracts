  "title": "Radiosurgery Facilitates Resection of Brain Arteriovenous Malformations and Reduces Surgical Morbidity",
  "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Stereotactic radiosurgery makes brain arteriovenous malformations (AVM) more manageable during their microsurgical resection. To better characterize these effects, we compared results of microsurgical resection of radiated (RS + ) and non-radiated (RS − ) AVMs to demonstrate that prior radiosurgery facilitates surgery and decreases operative morbidity.\n\nMETHODS: From of series of 344 patients who had AVM resections at the University of California, San Francisco (1997–2007), 21 RS + patients were matched with 21 RS − patients based on pre-treatment clinical and AVM characteristics. Matching was blinded to outcomes, which were assessed with the modified Rankin Scale (mRS).\n\nRESULTS: Mean AVM volume was reduced by 78% (P<0.01) and Spetzler-Martin grades were reduced in 52% of RS + patients (P < 0.001). Preoperative embolization was used less in RS + than in RS − patients (P< 0.001). Mean operative time (P< 0.01), blood loss (P < 0.05), and length of hospital stay (P< 0.05) were lower in the RS + group. Surgical morbidity was 14% higher in RS − patients, and they had significant worsening in mRS scores after surgery while RS + patients did not (P<0.01). RS + patients deteriorated between AVM diagnosis and surgery due to hemorrhages during the latency period (P< 0.05).\n\nCONCLUSION: Prior radiosurgery facilitates AVM microsurgery and decreases operative morbidity. Radiosurgery is recommended for unruptured AVMs that are not favorable for microsurgical resection. Microsurgical resection is recommended for radiated AVMs that are not completely obliterated after the 3-year latency period, but altered favorably for surgery, even in asymptomatic patients. Prompt resection of persistent AVMs should be considered to avoid the risk of post-latency hemorrhage and to optimize patient outcomes.",
