All enrolled patients signed informed consent forms. The inclusion criteria were as follows: (1) CRC confirmed by pathology before the operation; (2) 18 to 80 years old; (3) the related examination and pathology confirmed that stage III was T3N + M0 or T4N + M0 CRC. Exclusion criteria: (1) age 80 years or older; (2) lack of clinical data or follow-up information; (3) preoperative neoadjuvant chemotherapy; (4) death from other causes; (5) patients with previous or concurrent malignancy. All the eligible subjects were divided into 2 groups: observation group and control group. Observation group: patients who received intraperitoneal infusion chemotherapy with raltitrexed during operation. Control group: those who did not receive intraperitoneal infusion chemotherapy with raltitrexed during the operation.\n\nStudy Methodology\n\nTwo groups of patients were treated with laparoscopic radical resection of CRC. The operation procedures were as follows: The patients were taken lithotomy or herringbone position, after general anesthesia, 12 mm Hg artificial pneumoperitoneum was established routinely, and the operation was performed with a 5-hole poking-and-sticking pattern. The blood vessels of the tumor were cut off at the root, the lymph nodes were removed at the D3 level, the left and right hemicolons were resected according to the complete mesocolic excision standard, and the rectum was resected according to the total mesorectal excision standard. The control group patients according to the routine operation flow layer-by-layer abdominal closure and the end of the operation. The patients in the observation group were treated with intraperitoneal infusion of raltitrexed during radical resection surgery. Before abdominal closure, raltitrexed was diluted to 200 mL in 20 mL normal saline, then infused into the abdominal and pelvic cavity through a drainage tube, indwelling and clamping the abdominal drainage tube, closing the abdominal cavity, 2 hours after the end of the operation to open the perfusion fluid through the drainage tube out.\n\nObservation Indicators\n\nOne hundred ninety-five patients were followed up by telephone, in-patients medical records, and outpatient regular reexamination until May 2022. Progression-free survival (PFS) was defined as the time from radical resection of CRC until tumor progression, loss to follow-up, or death, OS was defined as the time from radical resection of CRC to death, loss to follow-up, or last follow-up.\n\nStatistical Methods\n\nSPSS 25.0 was used to analyze the data. The mean ± SD ( x ± s ) was used to describe the normal distribution. The t test was used to compare the 2 groups. The count data were expressed by the number of cases and the percentage, and the χ 2 test was used for the comparison between groups. A rank sum test was used for rank data. Kaplan-Meier method was used for survival analysis, and the log-rank method was used for the comparison of survival curves. Cox proportional hazards regression model was used for multivariate analysis. There was a significant difference in P <0.05.\n\nRESULTS\n\nData Collection\n\nFour hundred fourteen patients were collected, except 4 patients aged 80 years or older, 11 patients received neoadjuvant chemotherapy before the operation, of the 384 patients, 144 were in stage 2, 195 in stage III, and 45 in stage IV. All the patients were followed up, in this study, we investigated the effect of stage III raltitrexed IPC on the outcome of patients with CRC. The flowchart for patient selection is shown in Figure 1 .\n\nBaseline Characteristics of Observation and Control Group\n\nIn the observation group, there were 64 males and 36 females, with an age of (63.16 ± 10.49) years. In the control group, there were 51 males and 43 females, aged (63.4 ± 10.47) years. There was no significant difference in general data between the 2 groups ( P > 0.05). There was no significant difference in sex, tumor location, and stage between the 2 groups ( P > 0.05). Table 1 demonstrates details.\n\nAnalysis of Prognosis\n\nThe follow-up period was at least 48 months from the date of operation, 195 cases were effective and 67 cases had recurrence or metastasis. The most common of these are liver, lung, and abdominal metastases, 55 cases died and the OS rate was 71.79%.\n\nOverall Survival Analysis\n\nOS was 126.92 months in the observation group and 127.42 months in the control group. The median PFS was 124.67 months in the observation group and 119.42 days in the control group. Kaplan-Meier method was used to analyze the PFS and OS of the 2 groups. As shown in Figure 2 and Figure 3 , intraperitoneal infusion chemotherapy with raltitrexed can significantly improve the PFS and OS of patients with stage III CRC. Survival analysis of patients with stage III CRC can be observed, and the difference between the observation group and the control group can be observed. There was significant statistical significance in PFS (χ 2 = 5.416, P = 0.020) and OS (χ 2 = 4.673, P = 0.031).\n\nSingle Factor Analysis\n\nThe results of the log-rank test showed that patient sex, tumor location, and tumor stage were not associated with patient PFS ( P > 0.05), patient sex and tumor location were not associated with patient OS ( P > 0.05), but tumor stage was associated with patient OS (P < 0.05), as shown in Table 2 .\n\nMultivariate Cox Regression Analysis\n\nMultivariate Cox regression analysis showed that age and tumor stage were risk factors for PFS and OS, whereas tumor location was a separate risk factor for PFS ( P < 0.05), as shown in Table 3 .\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nCRC is one of the most common malignant tumors of the digestive tract. With the change in People’s lifestyle and diet structure, the incidence of CRC is increasing year by year, and the degree of population aging is getting worse. Recurrence and metastasis are relatively common. Cancer cells that fall directly into the abdominal cavity or subclinical micro-cancer foci that cannot be completely removed by surgery and are difficult to find and tumor cells that enter the peripheral circulation are the main reasons for postoperative recurrence, implantation, and metastasis of CRC. 18\n\nFrom a microscopic point of view, radical resection is almost impossible to remove all the tumor cells, the residual presence of small postoperative cancer foci and the shedding of tumor cells into the abdominal cavity are thought to be one of the common causes of CRC implantation, recurrence, and metastasis. 19 , 20 In combination with the factors of peritoneal injury during operation and the weak resistance of the patients, the exfoliated cancer cells infiltrated and adhered to the structures of blood vessels and lymphatics with the participation of a series of cytokines, with the lymph, blood or intestinal fluid overflow into the abdominal cavity to form implantation metastasis. Therefore, the best time to prevent free cancer cells from being implanted intraperitoneally should be during or early after surgery. 21\n\nFisher et al 22 demonstrated that residual cancer cells accelerated proliferation within 24 hours after primary lesion resection and could grow to gross visible neoplasia after 1 week. 11 Once CRC presents with extensive peritoneal metastasis, surgery can no longer be completely eradicated. 11 And the efficacy of intravenous chemotherapy is also very limited due to the presence of a plasma-peritoneal barrier, traditional intravenous chemotherapy drugs are difficult to reach the abdominal cavity. In recent years, the use of early postoperative IPC has emerged as one of the effective options for improving CRC survival. 4 , 5 For patients with 5-Fu-resistant metastatic CRC, raltitrexed combined with irinotecan can provide partial remission without increasing toxicity. 23 , 24 Subsequently, Hind et al 25 systematically and retrospectively analyzed the effects of raltitrexed, oxaliplatin, and irinotecan in advanced CRC, and pointed out that the combination of raltitrexed can achieve the best clinical therapeutic effect. to maximize economic benefits. And Xue et al 26 found that in the 3-year OS analysis of stage III cases, the 3-year OS was significantly higher in patients with intraperitoneal perfusion combined with intravenous infusion of raltitrexed than that in controls (χ 2 = 0.454, P = 0.042).\n\nThis study showed that the median follow-up time in the observation group was not significantly different from that in the control group, but raltitrexed was IPC. The PFS and OS of patients with stage III CRC were significantly improved, and the survival analysis of patients with stage III CRC was performed, there were significant differences in PFS (χ 2 = 5.416, P = 0.020) and OS (χ 2 = 4.673, P = 0.031) between the 2 groups. Log-rank test results showed that tumor stage had a significant effect on the OS of patients (χ 2 = 4.673, P < 6.685), which reflected that if the tumor stage was later, the number of lymph node metastasis was large, and IPC was not enough to clear it. Microscopic implantation metastases are not conducive to improving patient prognosis. Then the author conducted a multivariate cox regression analysis on the PFS and OS of the 2 groups of patients and found that IPC, age, and tumor stage were all risk factors affecting the patient’s PFS and OS ( P < 0.05). Risk factors ( P < 0.05).\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nThe use of IPC with raltitrexed during laparoscopic radical resection for CRC can achieve satisfactory results and improve the survival rate of patients with stage III CRC. Perioperative use of raltitrexed has been shown to be beneficial in terms of OS and PFS. However, this study is single, and it is not clear whether it is safe and feasible to use intraperitoneal perfusion chemotherapy with raltitrexed. Further prospective, multicenter, large-sample randomized controlled clinical studies are needed to clarify the role of intraoperative prophylactic raltitrexed intraperitoneal infusion chemotherapy in the treatment of CRC.",
