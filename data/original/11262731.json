  "abstract": "Background.: Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) is a common cause of end-stage kidney disease and frequently recurs after kidney transplantation.

The study assessed the efficacy of bleselumab combined with tacrolimus and corticosteroids as maintenance immunosuppression in the prevention of rFSGS >12 mo posttransplantation, versus standard of care (SOC) comprising tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil, and corticosteroids. All patients received basiliximab induction.

  "full_text": "INTRODUCTION\n\nFocal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) is a common cause of glomerular kidney disease, with progression to end-stage renal disease occurring in 40% to 60% of patients. 1 - 3 Among patients with primary FSGS who receive a kidney transplant, an estimated 6% to 55% will develop recurrent FSGS (rFSGS). 3 rFSGS is associated with poor allograft survival, and patients who lose their allograft because of rFSGS are at very high risk of subsequent recurrence, posing a barrier to retransplantation. 1 , 4 Plasmapheresis is currently the mainstay treatment for rFSGS, although response to treatment is inconsistent: one-fifth of patients fail to respond and one-third of patients who achieve full remission (urine protein-creatinine ratio ≤0.5 g/g) later relapse, requiring further plasmapheresis. 1\n\nAlthough the pathogenesis of rFSGS in allografts is not fully understood, evidence suggests that anti-CD40 autoantibody may play a role in its development, with blockade of the CD40–CD40 ligand interaction implicated in protection against in vivo induction of FSGS. 5 , 6 In vitro and in vivo studies demonstrate altered immunogenicity of the extracellular CD40 domain in rFSGS, with a potential mechanism involving synergism between the anti-CD40 autoantibody and soluble urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor (suPAR), resulting in podocyte injury and proteinuria—the principal clinical feature of FSGS. 5 , 7 Bleselumab (ASKP1240) is a novel, fully human immunoglobulin G4 anti-CD40 antagonistic monoclonal antibody that displayed a dose-dependent, prolonged occupancy of B-cell CD40 receptors in a phase 1b study in de novo kidney transplant recipients. 8 Bleselumab may, therefore, have a therapeutic effect for the prevention of rFSGS after kidney transplantation by either preventing the binding of anti-CD40 autoantibodies to podocytes in the kidney, or by blocking the interaction of CD40 ligand-expressing inflammatory cells with podocytes. 7\n\nHere, we describe the results of a proof-of-concept phase 2a, randomized, open-label study designed to assess the efficacy and safety of bleselumab in combination with tacrolimus (TAC) and corticosteroids, compared with standard of care (SOC) comprising TAC, mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), and corticosteroids, for maintenance immunosuppression and prevention of rFSGS over 12 mo posttransplantation. All patients received basiliximab induction.\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\n\nStudy Design\n\nThis phase 2a, randomized, open‐label, active control, multicenter study was conducted at 23 sites in Canada and the United States between May 2017 and May 2021 ( ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02921789 ). Kidney transplant recipients were randomized up to 4 d before or on the day of transplant (day 0) in a 1:1 ratio and stratified by previous kidney transplant status (yes/no) to open-label treatment with: SOC (basiliximab induction, immediate-release TAC [IR-TAC], corticosteroids + MMF) or bleselumab (basiliximab induction, IR-TAC, corticosteroids + bleselumab). Two doses of basiliximab induction were administered as 20-mg bolus infusions; the first dose was given intraoperatively before revascularization, and the second was given within 3 to 5 d posttransplant. The initial IR-TAC dose was administered orally posttransplant at 0.1 mg/kg/d (divided as two 0.05 mg/kg/d every 12 h; target trough level of 4 to 11 ng/mL for study duration). Initial MMF was administered as a dose of 1 g BID, up to 12 h preoperatively or before revascularization. Corticosteroids were administered posttransplant from day 0 through 12 mo and tapered to a low maintenance dose without withdrawal. Bleselumab was initiated intraoperatively before revascularization. It was administered over 30 min as a 200‐mg intravenous infusion on days 0, 7, 14, 28, 42, 56, 70, and 90, and monthly thereafter. All patients who did not have a biopsy with a diagnosis of rFSGS by 3 mo posttransplant had a protocol-defined biopsy at the day 90/mo 3 visit.\n\nCytomegalovirus (CMV) prophylaxis with valganciclovir was administered to all patients, apart from those in whom the donor and recipient were serologically negative for CMV. Prophylactic regimens for Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia, and fungal and bacterial infections were administered according to institutional protocols.\n\nAngiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers were permitted posttransplant. Pheresis and B cell–depleting agents could be prescribed for the benefit and safety of the patients; patients in the bleselumab arm who received plasmapheresis were required to discontinue bleselumab treatment but were permitted to remain on the protocol-defined visit schedule for the collection of safety and clinical assessment information.\n\nThe Institutional Review Board (IRB; protocol number 7163-CL-3201) of each site reviewed the ethical, scientific, and medical appropriateness of the study before it was conducted. The study was conducted in accordance with the protocol, Good Clinical Practice, the International Council for Harmonisation guidelines, applicable regulations and guidelines governing clinical study conduct, and ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki. All patients or their legally authorized representative provided written informed consent before enrollment.\n\nStudy Participants\n\nThis study enrolled recipients of a living or deceased donor kidney transplant aged ≥18 y, with a history of biopsy-proven primary FSGS (pFSGS) as a cause of end-stage renal disease in their native kidney, and whose current graft failure was also because of biopsy-proven rFSGS for those who had previously received a transplant. A diagnosis of pFSGS was determined by study investigators, and biopsies demonstrating pFSGS were required before enrollment. Study participants (and their partners) of childbearing potential were required to take effective measures to avoid pregnancy and to not breastfeed at screening, during the study period and for 90 d after final study drug administration. Exclusion criteria included: induction therapy other than study-assigned basiliximab; diagnosis of secondary FSGS (virus-associated, medication-induced, or adaptive) or a defined genetic cause of FSGS; previous organ transplantation, including kidney, with the most current graft failure not because of rFSGS; receipt of a kidney as part of a current multiorgan transplant; receipt of an ABO‐incompatible donor kidney; recipient or donor HIV seropositivity; current calculated panel reactive antibody (cPRA) level of >50%; current or recent history (≤5 y) of malignancy, except successfully treated nonmetastatic basal or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin, or renal cell carcinoma treated successfully >2 y before transplantation; significant liver disease; receipt of an immunologic biologic compound ≤8 wk pretransplant; and previous treatment with bleselumab.\n\nEndpoints\n\nIn line with US Food and Drug Administration recommendations received for the study, the prespecified primary study endpoint was the recurrence of FSGS, defined as nephrotic range proteinuria (protein-creatinine ratio ≥3.0 g/g), through 3 mo posttransplant, with death, graft loss, or loss to follow-up imputed as rFSGS.\n\nSecondary endpoints were as follows: recurrence of FSGS (defined above) through 6 and 12 mo posttransplant, with death, graft loss, or loss to follow-up imputed as rFSGS; biopsy-proven acute rejection (BPAR; T-cell mediated or antibody mediated; Banff grade ≥1, local review) through 3, 6, and 12 mo posttransplant; efficacy failure, defined as BPAR (Banff grade ≥1, local review), death, graft loss, or loss to follow-up, through 12 mo posttransplant; and biopsy-proven rFSGS determined by central-blinded review through 3, 6, and 12 mo posttransplant. Exploratory endpoints included recurrence of FSGS, defined strictly as nephrotic range proteinuria (protein-creatinine ratio ≥3.0 g/g) through 3, 6, and 12 mo posttransplant, without imputed death, graft loss, and loss to follow-up.\n\nAll episodes of kidney dysfunction based on any abnormal clinical signs and symptoms, as determined by the investigator, were evaluated for possible BPAR and/or rFSGS. Biopsy confirmation of a rejection episode was required at the local pathology laboratory before treatment initiation or within 48 h of initiation of treatment for acute rejection. All biopsy images for electron microscopy and slides for light microscopy used for local pathological review of BPAR and/or rFSGS were forwarded for central-blinded review by an independent pathologist to assess rFSGS. The urine protein-creatinine ratio for the patient was not provided to the central reader. Patients who did not have a biopsy with a diagnosis of rFSGS by 3 mo posttransplant had a protocol-defined biopsy at the day 90 visit. There were no other protocol-defined biopsies.\n\nSafety assessments included treatment‐emergent adverse events (TEAEs, reported using the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 5 grading scale) through 12 mo, serious adverse events (SAEs) through 12 mo, vital signs, clinical laboratory tests (hematology, biochemistry, coagulation/thrombotic pathway, hepatic profile, fasting lipid profile, urinalysis, and pregnancy testing), viral serology, and viral loads. Hy’s law was defined as alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) >3× upper limit of normal (ULN) plus total bilirubin >2× ULN. ULN was defined according to local laboratory normal values.\n\nStatistical Analyses\n\nEfficacy assessments were conducted in the full analysis set, which comprised all randomized patients who received at least 1 dose of study drug (basiliximab, bleselumab, MMF, or IR‐TAC), and received a kidney transplant. Safety assessments were conducted in the safety analysis set (SAF), which comprised all randomized patients who received at least 1 dose of study drug. TEAEs were assessed through 30 d post-last dose of study drug.\n\nThis was a proof-of-concept study intended to provide an estimate of the effect size for the difference in rFSGS incidence between SOC and bleselumab regimens. A sample size of 30 patients per group was selected based on the number who could be enrolled in a reasonable amount of time. The percentage of patients with rFSGS in each treatment arm, the absolute difference (bleselumab—SOC), the relative difference (bleselumab—SOC)/(SOC), and the 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for each were calculated. Incidence rates per treatment arm and differences between treatment arms with 95% CI were calculated for BPAR and efficacy failure.\n\nAll data processing, summarization, and analyses were performed using SAS v9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC).\n\nRESULTS\n\nPatient Disposition and Demographics\n\nOf 88 patients who provided informed consent, 67 were randomized to treatment (SOC [n = 34]; bleselumab [n = 33]) and 63 received ≥1 dose of study medication (SAF; Figure 1 ). Most study transplant recipients were male (61.9%), White (63.5%), with a mean (SD) age of 40.8 (14.0) y. Patient and donor demographics and clinical characteristics were generally similar between the 2 arms (Table 1 ). A higher percentage of patients in the SOC arm received B cell–depleting agents (20.6% versus 10.3%) or plasmapheresis (31.0% versus 16.0%) during the study, compared with the bleselumab arm (Table 2 ). Of B cell–depleting agents, only rituximab use was recorded; reported reasons for its use included rFSGS and antibody-mediated rejection ( Table S1, SDC, http://links.lww.com/TP/D13 ). Angiotensin II antagonists were also used more frequently in the SOC group than the bleselumab group (23.5% versus 10.3%, respectively); all were used for hypertension, with additional reasons of erythrocytosis for 1 patient and chronic kidney disease for 1 patient (Table 2 ).\n\nRecurrence of FSGS\n\nTreatment with bleselumab was associated with a numerical reduction that was not statistically significant in the incidence of the primary endpoint of rFSGS (including death, graft loss, and loss to follow-up) at 3 mo posttransplant of −12.7% (95% CI, −34.5 to 9.0): incidence rates were 5 of 27 (18.5%) with bleselumab and 10 of 32 (31.3%) with SOC (Figure 2 ). The relative decrease in incidence of rFSGS observed with bleselumab compared with SOC was −40.7% (95% CI, −89.8 to 26.8; P = 0.37, Fisher’s Exact test). By 12 mo of follow-up, there were no deaths, 1 graft loss in each of the treatment arms, and 1 loss to follow-up in the bleselumab arm and 4 in the SOC arm.\n\nThe exploratory endpoint of rFSGS defined strictly as nephrotic range proteinuria (protein-creatinine ratio of ≥3.0 g/g) without imputed death, graft loss, and loss to follow-up, was again numerically less frequent but not statistically significantly different in the bleselumab arm (4/26 [15.4%]) than in the SOC arm (8/30 [26.7%]), with a difference of −11.3% (95% CI, −32.3 to 9.8) (Figure 2 ) and a relative decrease of −42.3% (95% CI, −95.6 to 36.2; P = 0.35, Fisher’s Exact test) at 3 mo posttransplant. At 12 mo, in the SOC arm, all 8 recurrences had occurred within 8 d posttransplant, whereas in the bleselumab arm, 3 patients had rFSGS within the first week posttransplant, 1 at day 56, and 1 at day 225 posttransplant. The demographic composition of the patients who had proteinuria is described in Table 3 .\n\nFor patients who had at least 1 biopsy with evaluable pathology slides, the incidence of biopsy-proven rFSGS at 3 mo by central-blinded review was numerically lower but not statistically significantly different with bleselumab (7/22 [31.8%]) than with SOC (10/28 [35.7%]) (Figure 2 ). However, the difference between treatment arms was much smaller than that observed with urine protein-creatinine ratio findings (absolute difference −3.9% [95% CI, −30.2 to -22.4]; relative difference −10.9% [95% CI, −72.2 to 76.1; P = 1.00, Fisher’s Exact test]). Similarly, at 6 and 12 mo, there were consistently numerically lower incidences of biopsy-proven rFSGS with bleselumab than with SOC but with no statistically significant differences between treatments (Figure 2 ). At 6 mo, the absolute difference was −6.2% (95% CI, −31.7 to 19.3) and the relative difference was −17.0% (95% CI, −73.8 to 60.9; P = 0.77, Fisher’s Exact test). At 12 mo, the absolute difference was −7.5% (95% CI, −32.6 to 17.6) and the relative difference was −20.5% (95% CI, −75.2 to 54.6; P = 0.77, Fisher’s Exact test).\n\nOf the 26 biopsies from 18 patients in the full analysis set that showed rFSGS, 9 patients had elevated protein-creatinine ratio (bleselumab: 4; SOC: 5) at some time during the study ( Table S2, SDC, http://links.lww.com/TP/D13 ). Reasons for biopsy in those with an elevated protein-creatinine ratio were study protocol (4 patients), suspected rFSGS (4 patients), and suspected new rejection (1 patient) ( Table S2, SDC, http://links.lww.com/TP/D13 ). Observed elevated protein-creatinine ratios for these patients during the study ranged from 3.0 g/g to 40 g/g ( Table S2, SDC, http://links.lww.com/TP/D13 ). The degree of FPE was not reported for all patients, but for those with information available, FPE varied from 6% to 100%. Among these 9 patients, the histologic FSGS variant was perihilar in 1 patient receiving bleselumab (11.2%) and “not otherwise specified” (NOS, a standard FSGS lesion variant) in the other 8 (88.8%) patients.\n\nNine patients (bleselumab: 3; SOC: 6) had rFSGS by biopsy but did not have protein-creatinine elevation at any time during the study. For 8 of these 9 patients, the reason for biopsy was study protocol; the reason for biopsy in the 1 remaining patient was suspected new rejection ( Table S2, SDC, http://links.lww.com/TP/D13 ). The majority of protein-creatinine ratios for these 9 patients were <1.0 g/g ( Table S2, SDC, http://links.lww.com/TP/D13 ). Of these 9 patients, 3 patients receiving SOC had a perihilar variant, with the others having the NOS variant. For patients with available day 90 biopsy information, the degree of FPE was 30% to 90% ( Table S2, SDC, http://links.lww.com/TP/D13 ).\n\nThere were 4 patients, 1 in the bleselumab arm, and 3 in the SOC arm, who developed nephrotic range proteinuria but did not have rFSGS according to central review. For the bleselumab-treated patient, the pathology findings were arteriolitis, borderline changes for rejection, mild interstitial fibrosis, and tubular atrophy (<25% of cortical area). Of the 3 SOC-treated patients, 1 patient had extensive foot process effacement (FPE), 1 had acute rejection with both cell- and antibody-mediated components, and 1 had early allograft glomerulitis, mononuclear cell interstitial inflammation, tubulitis, and arteriolar hyaline thickening.\n\nBy the end of the study, there were 3 patients in each treatment arm who did not provide a biopsy for central review.\n\nOverall, the treatment differences observed for each of the endpoints at 3 mo posttransplant, namely rFSGS with death, graft loss, and loss to follow-up imputed as recurrence, rFSGS defined as urine protein-creatinine ratio of ≥3.0 g/g, and biopsy-proven rFSGS, were consistent at 6 and 12 mo posttransplant (Figure 2 ).\n\nBiopsy-proven Acute Rejection\n\nIn this small sample of patients, BPAR determined by a local pathologist was numerically slightly more frequent within the first 3 mo posttransplant in those treated with bleselumab (7/26 [26.9%]) than SOC (6/30 [20%]) (Figure 3 ). One additional patient in the SOC arm had BPAR 198 d posttransplant. These differences were not statistically significant. In the SOC arm, there were 2 grade IA, 1 IB, and 2 IIA T cell–mediated rejections, and 3 grade I and 1 grade II antibody-mediated rejections. In the bleselumab arm, there were 4 IA and 2 IB T cell–mediated rejections, and a single grade II antibody-mediated rejection (Table 4 ). The incidence of BPAR was similar between the 2 treatment arms when those who were lost to follow-up were counted as having a BPAR.\n\nThere were no deaths in this study. One patient in the SOC arm experienced a graft loss on day 13 because of acute rejection, and 1 patient in the bleselumab arm experienced a graft loss on day 156 because of recurrent FSGS and acute rejection. Efficacy failure (defined as rejection, graft loss, death, or loss to follow-up) occurred with numerically slightly greater frequency in the bleselumab treatment arm at 3 mo, but there were no differences by 12 mo of follow-up; the between-treatment difference was not statistically significant (Figure 4 ).\n\nSafety\n\nOverall, 29 of 29 (100%) of bleselumab- and 31 of 34 (91.2%) of SOC-treated patients reported at least 1 TEAE during the study (Table 5 ). There was a numerically higher proportion of drug-related TEAEs and TEAEs leading to treatment withdrawal in the bleselumab arm (Table 5 ). The most common TEAEs by system organ class were infections (bleselumab arm 75.9%, SOC arm 64.7%) followed by gastrointestinal disorders (bleselumab arm 69.0%, SOC arm 61.8%), including diarrhea, nausea, constipation, and vomiting (Table 6 ). Some of the most common TEAEs were those associated with transplant surgery: anemia, leukopenia, leukocytosis, and neutropenia (Table 6 ). A numerically greater proportion of patients in the SOC arm reported nausea and vomiting, which is consistent with MMF administration.\n\nOverall, there was a numerically higher incidence of SAEs in the bleselumab arm (55.2%) than the SOC arm (47.1%) (Table 7 ). Renal and urinary disorders were the most common SAEs, affecting 20.7% receiving bleselumab and 29.4% receiving SOC, followed by infections, affecting 17.2% and 26.5% in the bleselumab and SOC arms, respectively (Table 7 ). Serious infections were numerically more common in the SOC arm (26.5%) than the bleselumab arm (17.2%). No deaths occurred. The only drug-related SAE that occurred in 2 patients was urosepsis in the SOC arm; all other drug-related SAEs occurred in 1 patient per event, in both bleselumab and SOC arms.\n\nThe incidence of potentially clinically significant elevated liver function tests (ALT and/or AST >3 × ULN, with/without bilirubin >2 × ULN) was numerically higher in the bleselumab arm than in the SOC arm ( Table 8 ). There was no occurrence of Hy’s law.\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nIncluding bleselumab as part of the immunosuppressive regimen for kidney transplant recipients at risk of recurrence of FSGS reduced the occurrence of proteinuria (defined as urine protein-creatinine ratio of at least 3 g/g) by approximately 40% relative to SOC, resulting in an absolute decrease of between 12% and 13%. However, biopsy review by a central, blinded reader did not support a treatment difference, since the relative decrease was only approximately 11% (absolute decrease 3.9%) at 3 mo posttransplant and approximately 21% (absolute decrease 7.5%) at 12 mo posttransplant. Confidence intervals for all measures included zero, indicating no statistically significant difference between treatment arms.\n\nNotably, although the bleselumab-containing regimen appeared to be associated with prevention of clinical (symptomatic) recurrence of FSGS, defined as protein-creatinine ratio ≥3.0 g/g, there was evidence of subclinical recurrence. Histologic analysis of patients with rFSGS revealed that perihilar variants were present in 1 patient with elevated protein-creatinine ratio who received bleselumab and in 3 patients lacking elevated protein-creatinine ratio who received SOC. It could be speculated that, similar to the situation in which minimal-change disease can cause nephrotic syndrome without presence of sclerosing glomerular lesions, bleselumab could influence factors other than glomerular sclerosis and whether or not nephrotic syndrome occurs. Both structural genetic and dynamic factors are implicated in proteinuria and the dynamic factors, that is, minimal-change disease, can cause proteinuria in the absence of glomerulosclerosis. The lower incidence of proteinuria at 3 mo in the bleselumab treatment arm compared with the SOC arm could point to its potential for preventing proteinuria arising from dynamic factors, while at 12 mo, proteinuria is mainly caused by structural factors, which bleselumab is less able to influence. The possible mechanism accounting for these findings would need to be confirmed by further study.\n\nAt 3, 6, and 12 mo, BPAR occurred at a numerically higher incidence in the bleselumab arm than in the SOC arm. It should be noted that there is ongoing research on alternative endpoints for rejection, 9 , 10 which might better reflect the outcome of rejection episodes.\n\nThe most common TEAEs leading to withdrawal of bleselumab were mainly renal and urinary disorders (including rFSGS and kidney transplant rejection). For SOC, the TEAEs leading to withdrawal were not confined to the kidneys (worsening tremor, BK virus infection, and postoperative hematoma). There were no deaths during the study, and 1 graft loss occurred in each treatment arm. Serious gastrointestinal AEs were reported more frequently with bleselumab than SOC, but were not unique, and this finding may be because of physicians’ experience with the SOC and familiarity with treating these AEs. The reduced rate of serious infections in the bleselumab arm may indicate that the bleselumab regimen was less immunosuppressive; however, this is a small study so this observation would need to be substantiated in any additional trial. Instances of clinically significant liver enzyme changes did occur in the bleselumab arm, which is consistent with other monoclonal antibodies 11 and the previous bleselumab phase 2 study. 12\n\nA key strength of this study is in the determination of rFSGS: a central-blinded pathologist reviewed the biopsy slides and determined whether there was evidence for recurrence of FSGS in the transplanted kidney. Limitations of this phase 2a study include its open-label design, its small sample size, and that it was not powered to show a prespecified difference between treatment arms. Indeed, for a rFSGS rate of 30% in the SOC arm, and a 50% decrease in recurrence rate of FSGS in the bleselumab arm, a sample size of 131 patients per arm would be needed. For a recurrence rate of 10 of 32 (31.3%) in the SOC arm, 2 or fewer recurrences would be needed in the bleselumab arm (comprising 27 patients) to achieve statistical significance, but there were 5 incidences of rFSGS. Had evidence supported the efficacy of bleselumab in this setting, then a fully powered phase 3 study would have been conducted. Instead, the purpose of this proof-of-concept study was to obtain estimates of the response in each of the treatment arms, the difference and the relative difference between the 2 arms. As such, the definitions of endpoints, which followed US Food and Drug Administration recommendations, may not be in line with the intuitive definition of rFSGS, which may be expected to be nephrotic range proteinuria with biopsy findings confirming diffuse foot process podocyte effacement. 1 , 13 To facilitate patient enrollment in the study, patients were permitted to have cPRA percentage of ≤50%, which may be perceived as allowing relatively highly sensitized patients to be included and could have been a further limitation of the study. However, the highest percent cPRA recorded for enrolled patients was 37%. In light of the small sample size of the study, an attempt was made to minimize variability by only using basiliximab as induction therapy, which may also be perceived as a limitation of the study, given the inclusion criterion of cPRA ≤50% and the potential association between basiliximab induction and increased risk of BPAR in highly sensitized patients. 14\n\nAnother potential limitation of the study is the choice of endpoints. Since T cell–mediated rejection is often easily treated 15 and can result in excellent clinical outcomes, BPAR may not be the most appropriate endpoint for evaluating antirejection effects and outcomes. In fact, future clinical trials are likely to favor more nuanced endpoints. 9 , 10 Finally, it should be borne in mind that kidney transplant recipients with FSGS have a variety of etiologies, which may have influenced outcomes, as would any underlying conditions of the kidney donors.\n\nRecently, it has become evident how few randomized trials have been conducted in FSGS. 2 This dearth of clinical trials is one of the main barriers to innovation in the nephrology field, as recently commented upon, 16 and is a key reason for the establishment of the Glomerular Disease Study and Trial Consortium (GlomCon). 17 Given the rarity of clinical trials in FSGS, there is value in describing existing trials. A complete description of a trial of 2 regimens for the treatment of FSGS in children and adults that did not meet intended targets was provided in 2011, 18 and there has also been a partial description of a trial in progress. 19 Although the current study did not demonstrate a role for bleselumab in the prevention of rFSGS after kidney transplantation, it does provide an insight into the potential pathophysiologic mechanism involved in recurrence of FSGS in these patients.\n\nIn conclusion, treatment incorporating the fully human immunoglobulin G4 anti-CD40 antagonistic monoclonal antibody, bleselumab, reduced the occurrence of proteinuria in kidney transplant recipients at risk of posttransplant recurrence of FSGS, but this difference was not statistically significant. However, no treatment difference compared with SOC was noted for the incidence of biopsy-proven recurrence of FSGS.",
