  "title": "Cervical Spondylotic Myelopathy Surgical (CSM-S) Trial: Randomized Controlled Trial Design and Rationale",
  "abstract": "Background: Cervical spondylotic myelopathy (CSM) is the most common cause of spinal cord dysfunction in the world. There is significant practice variation and uncertainty as to the optimal surgical approach for treating CSM.\n\nObjective: The primary objective is to determine if ventral surgery is associated with superior SF-36 Physical Component Summary (PCS) outcome at one year follow-up compared to dorsal (laminectomy/fusion or laminoplasty) surgery for the treatment of CSM. The study will also investigate whether post-operative sagittal balance is an independent predictor of overall outcome and will compare health resource utilization for ventral and dorsal procedures.\n\nMethods: The study is a randomized, controlled trial with a nonrandomized arm for patients who are eligible but decline randomization. Two hundred fifty patients (159 randomized) with CSM from 11 sites will be recruited over 18 months. The primary outcome is the Short Form-36 PCS score. Secondary outcomes include disease specific outcomes, overall health-related quality of life (EuroQol-5D), and health resource utilization.\n\nExpected Outcomes: This will be the first randomized controlled trial to compare directly the health-related quality of life outcomes for ventral versus dorsal surgery for treating CSM.\n\nDiscussion: An NIH-funded (1R13AR065834-01) investigator meeting was held prior to initiating the trial in order to bring multiple stakeholders together to finalize the study protocol. Study investigators, coordinators, and major stakeholders were able to attend and discuss strengths, limitations, and concerns regarding the study. The final protocol was approved for funding by PCORI (CE-1304-6173). The RCT began enrollment on April 1, 2014.",
