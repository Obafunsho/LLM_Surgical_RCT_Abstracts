  "title": "Patient Reported Outcomes after Metabolic Surgery versus Medical Therapy for Diabetes: Insights from the STAMPEDE Randomized Trial",
  "abstract": "Objective: To investigate the long-term effects of medical and surgical treatments of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) on patient reported outcomes (PROs).\n\nBackground: Robust data on PROs from randomized trials comparing medical and surgical treatments for T2DM are lacking.\n\nMethods: The Surgical Treatment And Medications Potentially Eradicate Diabetes Efficiently (STAMPEDE) trial showed that 5-years after randomization, Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) and sleeve gastrectomy (SG) were superior to intensive medical therapy (IMT) alone in achieving glycemic control in patients with T2DM and obesity. A subset of 104 patients participating in the STAMPEDE trial were administered two generic health-related quality of life (QoL) questionnaires (RAND-36 and EQ-5D-3L) and a diabetes-specific instrument at baseline, and then on an annual basis up to 5-years after randomization.\n\nResults: On longitudinal analysis, RYGB and SG significantly improved the domains of physical functioning, general health perception, energy/fatigue, and diabetes-related QoL compared with IMT group. In the IMT group, none of the QoL components in the generic questionnaires improved significantly from baseline. No significant long-term differences were observed among the study groups in measures of psychological and social aspects of QoL. On multivariable analysis, independent factors associated with improved general health perception at long-term included baseline general health (P<0.001), insulin independence at 5-years (P=0.005), RYGB versus IMT (P=0.005), and SG versus IMT (P=0.034). Favorable changes following RYGB and SG were comparable.\n\nConclusion: In patients with T2DM, metabolic surgery is associated with long-term favorable changes in certain PROs compared with IMT, mainly on physical health and diabetes-related domains. Psychosocial well‐being warrants greater attention after metabolic surgery.",
