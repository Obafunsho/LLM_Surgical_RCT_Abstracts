  "abstract": "Objective: To test the safety and efficacy of combination treatment for pleural mesothelioma (PM) with intracavitary cisplatin-fibrin (cis-fib) plus hemithoracic irradiation (IR) applied after lung-sparing surgery in an orthotopic immunocompetent rat model.\n\nMethods: We randomized male F344 rats into 5 groups: cis-fib (n = 9), 10 Gy IR (n = 6), 20 Gy IR (n = 9), cis-fib+10 Gy IR (n = 6), and cis-fib+20 Gy IR (n = 9). Subpleural tumor implantation was performed on day 0 with 1 million syngeneic rat mesothelioma cells (IL45-luciferase). Tumors were resected on day 9, followed by treatment with intracavitary cis-fib or vehicle control (NaCl-fib). On day 12, computed tomography–guided local irradiation in a single high dose of the former tumor region was applied.\n\nResults: We observed only short-term side effects related to 20 Gy radiotherapy. Compared to 20 Gy, 10 Gy IR did not show an impact on tumor growth. At 3 days after treatment with 20 Gy IR (day 15 of the experiment), we detected significantly smaller tumors in the cis-fib+IR group compared to IR alone (mean tumor growth, 252% vs 539%; P = .04). On day 21, there was a significant difference in tumor growth between cis-fib–treated and cis-fib+IR– treated tumors (mean tumor growth, 2295% vs 660%; P = .01).\n\nConclusions: Localized treatment after tumor resection in PM aims to improve local tumor control. Irradiation applied in combination with intracavitary cis-fib in rats is safe up to a dosage of 20 Gy and shows an additive effect on tumor growth delay compared to the single treatments.",

All experimental procedures were reviewed and authorized by the Veterinary Office of Zurich, Switzerland (license no. ZH095/2016, approved February 12, 2016) and were performed in accordance with European Union Directive 2010/63/EU for animal experiments. Male Fischer 344 rats (10 weeks old; Charles River Laboratories) were accommodated to the housing facility for at least 2 of weeks acclimatization. On day 0 (D0), 50 μL of freshly prepared sterile cell suspension of 1 × 10 6 IL45- luc cells in Dulbecco’s phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) was implanted underneath the parietal pleura as described previously. IL45-luc generated sarcomatoid tumors in this rat model. 18 Animals were randomized into 5 groups: cis-fib (n = 9), 10 Gy IR (n = 6), 20 Gy IR (n = 9), cis-fib+10 Gy IR (n = 6), and cis-fib+20 Gy IR (n = 9). Our research question focused on the comparison between 2 treatment modalities (cis-fib and IR); thus, we omitted the untreated control group from this experimental setting. This complies with the 3Rs principle of ethical use of experimental animals, to reduce the number of animals for this research question.\n\nOn D9, at which point tumor nodules were visible on bioluminescent imaging in all rats, we performed a lung-sparing tumor resection resembling pleurectomy/decortication in humans. We performed an incision at the injection site and resected the visible tumor nodule while avoiding damage to the lung. Cisplatin-fibrin was prepared as described previously 10 , 12 and applied immediately on the resected area on completion of the resection. 10 , 12 Animals in the IR groups underwent irradiation at 3 days after the operation (D12).\n\nLocal Intracavitary Treatment\n\nFor each rat, 0.2 mL of the cisplatin-fibrin gel (containing 0.1 mg of cisplatin) was applied to cover the entire resection site (∼2 cm 2 ). Details on the preparation of cisplatin-fibrin are provided in the Appendix E1 . This local dose of 0.05 mg/cm 2 of resected pleural surface area is equivalent to the dose previously tested in our pig model (5 mg/100 cm 2 pleural surface) that showed no toxicity 11 and corresponds to approximately 33 mg/m 2 of body surface area tested in our phase I clinical trial. 13\n\nImage-Guided Local IR\n\nA single dose of IR was delivered at a rate of 3 Gy/min with an image-guided stereotactic small animal irradiation unit (Precision X-Ray, X-Rad SmART 225kV unit, equipped with a cone beam CT scanner), as described in the Appendix E1 .\n\nIn Vivo Imaging and Signal Quantification\n\nThe monitoring of tumor burden by bioluminescent imaging (Bli) was performed on D8 (before tumor resection), on D12, and every 3 days thereafter until the termination of the experiment. Because only tumor cells were transfected with vectors expressing luciferase, the bioluminescent signal reflects numbers of tumor cell proportionally 19 ( Appendix E1 ).\n\nHealth Monitoring and Assessment of OS\n\nAfter surgery, animal health and well-being were monitored daily, blinded for altered health condition. In brief, animals were monitored for signs of side effects resulting from chemotherapy and radiotherapy, including changes in body weight, body condition score, sign of distress and pain, and signs of respiratory problems, such as blue/white extremities due to desaturation or increased breathing rate. Overall survival (OS) was defined as the time from tumor implantation until the end of the experiment when at least 1 of the termination criteria was met ( Table E1 ).\n\nHistologic Analysis of Tumor and Lungs\n\nWe harvested tumors and the lungs and preserved by formalin fixation. Histology of the lungs were assessed by hematoxylin and eosin staining. The tumor proliferation rate was determined using Ki-67 staining on paraffin-embedded sections ( Appendix E1 ).\n\nAnalysis of Blood Cell Components\n\nSublingual blood was collected on the day before tumor implantation (D-1), the day before tumor resection (D8), at 3 days after irradiation (D15), and prior to euthanasia for analysis of overall leukocyte, neutrophil, and lymphocyte counts. Details of the FACS analysis are provided in the Appendix E1 .\n\nResults\n\nAdditive and Radiosensitization Effects of Cisplatin In Vitro\n\nWe first evaluated the efficacy of the combined cisplatin and IR treatment in IL45- luc in vitro. We observed a dose-dependent response to the combined treatment and detected an additive effect after short-term treatment (72 hours) as assessed by a cell viability assay ( Figure 2 , A ). A colony-formation assay was performed to identify the effect of single cell proliferation for longer treatment (7 days) with the cisplatin–IR combination ( Figure 2 , B ). We calculated the combination index (CI) using the data generated from CFA using CompuSyn software and detected a synergistic effect (CI < 1) of 0.155 μM cisplatin and IR starting at 8 Gy (CI = 0.95) and more profoundly at 10 Gy (CI = 0.62). These data suggest a radiosensitising effect of cisplatin in IL45- luc cells when combined with high-dose radiation.\n\nSafety of Combined cis-fib+IR in Rat PM Model\n\nAll animals were monitored closely and daily after treatment for signs of side effects resulting from chemotherapy and radiotherapy (eg, changes in body weight, body condition score, signs of distress, pain) and for signs of reduced pulmonary function. We found a loss of body weight in all animals immediately following tumor resection surgery, which continued until D14. There was no difference in weight loss between the cis-fib and cis-NaCl groups. None of the animals showed deterioration of body conditioning or activity score in the immediate postinterventional phase or any signs of pulmonary side effects. On D12, animals were subjected to Bli measurement under general anesthesia, along with IR that caused further weight loss ( Figure 3 , A and B ). Treatment with a single dose of 20 Gy or cis-fib+20 Gy IR caused significantly more weight loss on the day after treatment (D13 vs D12) compared to the no IR group, but all animals regained this weight within 2 days ( Figure 3 , B ).\n\nWhite blood cell count revealed a drop in lymphocyte count at D15 (3 days after IR) following 20 Gy IR but not after 10 Gy IR or cis-fib alone ( Figure 3 , C ). Combination treatment with cis-fib followed by 20 Gy IR caused a drop in lymphocyte count to the same extent as 20 Gy IR alone ( Figure 3 , C ). The decrease also applied to all lymphocyte subpopulations (CD4 + , CD8 + , and natural killer [NK] cells) ( Figure E1 ). Lymphocyte counts were again increased to levels comparable to those before IR at the time of euthanasia. Neutrophil counts did not change following both 10 Gy IR and 20 Gy IR ( Figure 3 , D ). Neutrophil counts were significantly elevated at the time of euthanasia, indicating an ongoing inflammatory process resulting from tumor growth.\n\nWe further analyzed the effect of IR on the underlying lungs assessed at the endpoint and found no increased fibrosis in the irradiated groups compared to the nonirradiated group ( Figure E2 and Appendix E1 , Results).\n\nTreatment Efficacy\n\nTo evaluate treatment efficacy, we assessed 2 different endpoints: tumor growth, monitored by repeated Bli imaging every 3 days, and OS. We implanted tumor cell suspension underneath the subparietal pleura to create a single tumor. On day 8 after implantation, in the majority of animals, Bil imaging detected a single large nodule at the injection site, along with smaller detectable nodules in some animals ( Figure 4 , C ). Cis-fib alone caused a delay in tumor growth up until D15 ( Figure 4 , A , compare growth curve from D8 to D12 and D15). We started with a low IR dosage (10 Gy) and detected comparable tumor growth in animals treated with 10 Gy IR compared to no IR (the cis-fib group) ( Figure 4 , A ; compare D12 vs D15). Accordingly, there was no significant improvement in OS with cis-fib+10 Gy IR compared to the single treatments ( Figure 4 , D ). Thus, we decided to escalate to 20 Gy IR after treating 6 animals per group.\n\nAt 3 days after treatment with 20 Gy IR (D15), we detected significantly smaller tumors in the cis-fib+IR group compared to the IR-alone group (mean tumor growth, 252% vs 539%; P = .04). On D21, there was a significant difference in tumor growth between cis-fib–treated and cis-fib+20 Gy IR–treated tumors (mean tumor growth, 2295% vs 660%; P = .01) ( Figure 4 , B ). Accordingly, the greater delay in tumor growth of IR-treated tumors was reflected in a flattening of the growth curve up until D21. This growth delay effect of IR diminished after D21 (9 days post-IR). Representative Bli images are shown in Figure 4 , C . Although significant improvement in tumor growth control was achieved, we detected no difference in OS with cis-fib+20 Gy IR compared to cis-fib alone or to 20 Gy IR alone ( Figure 4 , E ).\n\nDiscussion\n\nThe present study demonstrates that the combination of cis-fib followed by 20 Gy IR is safe and resulted in a significant tumor growth delay compared to the single treatments in our orthotopic rat model of PM ( Figure 5 ). Owing to the widespread and diffuse growth of the tumor along the pleura, achieving microscopic complete resection is almost impossible in PM. Thus, additional treatment approaches, in form of, for example, providing local treatment as part of surgical resection and targeting the remaining microscopic tumor, are urgently needed to reduce early recurrent outgrowth.\n\nThe feasibility and efficacy of local irradiation have been investigated in several clinical trials for PM 20 , 21 , 22 , 23 ; however, due to the sensitivity of the underlying organs and high risk of irradiation-related toxicities, not every patient is eligible for this adjuvant therapy. Determination of appropriate timing before and after surgery has been evaluated in several clinical trials, but the results are insufficient to allow for a clear conclusion. 23 , 24 , 25 Significantly improved survival outcomes of radiotherapy provided before surgery was shown in the SMART clinical trial. 26 For radiotherapy given postoperatively, the SAKK 17/04 trial investigated fractionated radiotherapy following surgery (extrapleural pneumonectomy) versus postoperative observation and showed that radiotherapy was associated with a marginal improvement in median locoregional relapse-free survival (9.4 vs 7.6 months). 27\n\nInitial in vitro experiments on rat IL-45 PM cells confirmed findings for other cancers 16 , 28 that pretreatment with cisplatin can sensitize to IR. Using an orthotopic rat model of PM, we further aimed to identify whether adding local cisplatin could improve the effect of IR administered after surgery.\n\nThe data from this animal study show that adding the 2 local treatment modalities after surgical tumor resection is not associated with an increased risk of treatment-related toxicities. IR-related toxicities (eg, decreased body weight and lymphocyte count) were observed after 20 Gy, but these effects were only transient. Because the rats receiving 10 Gy IR alone showed stronger tumor growth compared to those treated with cis-fib alone (without IR), we conclude that this IR dosage is not sufficient to achieve local tumor control. Application of 20 Gy adjuvant IR resulted in slightly better local tumor control than cis-fib alone. Thus, our data suggest an additive effect of the 2 local treatment modalities. Although these data certainly require validation, we have shown that it is possible to increase the local tumor control achieved by adding adjuvant IR after cis-fib.\n\nAlthough the data from our Bli analysis 18 showed a significant additive effect of intracavitary cis-fib and 20 Gy IR, resulting in significantly delayed tumor growth compared to the single treatments, we did not observe a difference in OS between the treatment groups. The underlying reasons for this lack of translation into survival are most likely attributable to the intense schedule of our animal experiments. Stress caused by anesthesia and resulting weight loss likely contributed to the overall well-being of all animals independent of their tumor burden or treatment schedule; therefore, OS cannot be attributed specifically to the tumor burden.\n\nLimitations\n\nThe setup of the rat model requires further adjustments. In human patients, IR is usually given in smaller fractions, not as single high dose. Hypofractionated irradiation might result in different outcomes. The aim of this model was to create a similar scenario for local recurrence, the original problem of treatment for PM. The generation of single tumor nodules allows us to better control and monitor the recurrence after resection and treatment. Nevertheless, some leakages resulting in smaller nodules that were not macroscopically visible at resection might result in a high standard deviation of tumor growth observed. In this experimental setting, analysis of tissues was possible only at the conclusion of the experiment, the stage at which tumor regrowth has already occurred. Thus, the analysis of tissues at this late time point did not provide additional informative data on response to treatment on cellular and molecular levels.\n\nConclusions\n\nCis-fib has been deemed feasible and safe in phase I and II clinical trials at our institution. Here we further demonstrate that adjuvant radiotherapy provided after local intracavitary treatment with cis-fib is safe and suggest a benefit of this combined treatment for tumor control in this rat recurrence model.\n\nConflict of Interest Statement\n\nI.O. reports receiving institutional grants from Roche, Medtronic, and XVIVO; serving on a steering committee for Roche Genentech and on advisory boards for AstraZeneca, MSD, BMS, Medtronic, and Regeneron; serving as a proctor for Intuitive; and receiving speaking fees from Intuitive, Sanofi, and Siemens.
