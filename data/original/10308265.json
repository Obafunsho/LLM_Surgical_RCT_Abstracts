  "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:: Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is an antibody-mediated condition that leads to thrombocytopenia and possible thrombosis. Patients with HIT who require cardiac surgery pose a challenge as high doses of heparin or heparin alternatives are required to permit cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). Intraoperative therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) is a valuable adjunct in the management of antibody-mediated syndromes including HIT. The clinical impact of TPE on thromboembolic events, bleeding, and mortality after heparin re-exposure is not well established. We hypothesized that TPE with heparin re-exposure will not lead to HIT-related thromboembolic events, bleeding, or increased mortality after cardiac surgery with CPB.\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS:: We reviewed 330 patients who received perioperative TPE between September 2012 and September 2017.\n\nRESULTS:: 24 patients received TPE for HIT before anticipated heparin use for CPB. Most patients were males (79%) scheduled for advanced heart failure therapies. Three patients (12.5%) died within 30 days after surgery but none of the deaths were considered HIT-related. Thromboembolic events (TE) occurred in 3 patients within 7 days of surgery; of those, two were possibly HIT-related.\n\nCONCLUSION:: TPE with heparin re-exposure was not strongly associated with HIT-related thrombosis/death after cardiac surgery with CPB.",
