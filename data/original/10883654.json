  "title": "NEO-GAP: A Single-Arm, Phase II Feasibility Trial of Neoadjuvant Gemcitabine, Cisplatin, and Nab-Paclitaxel for Resectable, High-Risk Intrahepatic Cholangiocarcinoma",
  "abstract": "Purpose.: Most patients with intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (IHCC) develop recurrence after resection. Adjuvant capecitabine remains the standard of care for resected IHCC. A combination of gemcitabine, cisplatin, and nab-paclitaxel (GAP) was associated with a 45% response rate and 20% conversion rate among patients with unresectable biliary tract cancers. The aim of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of delivering GAP in the neoadjuvant setting for resectable, high-risk IHCC.\n\nMethods.: A multi-institutional, single-arm, phase II trial was conducted for patients with resectable, high-risk IHCC, defined as tumor size > 5 cm, multiple tumors, presence of radiographic major vascular invasion, or lymph node involvement. Patients received preoperative GAP (gemcitabine 800 mg/m 2 , cisplatin 25 mg/m 2 , and nab-paclitaxel 100 mg/m 2 on days 1 and 8 of a 21-day cycle) for a total of 4 cycles prior to an attempt at curative-intent surgical resection. The primary endpoint was completion of both preoperative chemotherapy and surgical resection. Secondary endpoints were adverse events, radiologic response, recurrence-free survival (RFS), and overall survival (OS).\n\nResults.: Thirty evaluable patients were enrolled. Median age was 60.5 years. Median follow-up for all patients was 17 months. Ten patients (33%) experienced grade ≥ 3 treatment-related adverse events, the most common being neutropenia and diarrhea; 50% required ≥ 1 dose reduction. The disease control rate was 90% (progressive disease: 10%, partial response: 23%, stable disease: 67%). There was zero treatment-related mortality. Twenty-two patients (73%, 90% CI 57–86; p = 0.008) completed all chemotherapy and surgery. Two patients (9%) who successfully underwent resection had minor postoperative complications. Median length of hospital stay was 4 days. Median RFS was 7.1 months. Median OS for the entire cohort was 24 months and was not reached in patients who underwent surgical resection.\n\nConclusion.: Neoadjuvant treatment with gemcitabine, cisplatin, and nab-paclitaxel is feasible and safe prior to resection of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma and does not adversely impact perioperative outcomes.",
