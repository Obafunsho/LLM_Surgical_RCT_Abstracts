  "full_text": "Introduction\n\nBackground and rationale\n\nVenous access is essential in critically ill patients. Central venous catheters (CVCs) are frequently used in the world and especially in intensive care units (ICUs). 1 2 Key indications of CVC include the administration of venotoxic drugs (catecholamines, chemotherapy), parenteral nutrition, hypertonic solutions and haemodynamic monitoring. 3\n\nDespite their frequent use, CVCs are associated with several risks, including mechanical complications (such as pneumothorax, arterial puncture, haemothorax, gas embolism and cardiac arrhythmias), infectious complications and thrombotic complications. 4 Mechanical complications occur in 5%–19% of cases, infectious complications in 5%–26% and thrombotic complications are reported in 2%–26% of cases. 5 Once the patient is stabilised, the clinical indication for maintaining the CVC should be carefully reassessed to reduce the risk of infectious or thrombotic complications. If the CVC is deemed no longer necessary or potentially futile, its removal should be considered to minimise associated risks. In such cases, placement of a peripheral venous catheter (PVC) as a backup access may be appropriate. 1 6 The primary advantage of replacing a CVC with a PVC is to reduce the risk of catheter-related bacteraemia, with a cumulative incidence higher with CVC. 7 9 Moreover, the daily infection risk for CVCs remains constant beyond the fifth day of catheterisation, reinforcing the importance of minimising central access duration when possible. 10 Complications of PVC exist but remain essentially local, including phlebitis, extravasation, haematoma and local infection. 11 12\n\nThe landmark approach for PVC access involves applying a tourniquet to the upper limb, identifying a suitable vein, disinfecting the puncture site and inserting the catheter. However, establishing PVC in intensive care can be challenging for healthcare teams. Factors such as obesity, dehydration, oedema, the need for venotoxic drugs and a history of intravenous drug use can complicate PVC placement. 13 Some venotoxic drugs used on PVCs, such as vasopressors, nicardipine, amiodarone or levetiracetam, can lead to vein inflammation and thrombosis and are often administered before CVC placement. 14 16\n\nNear-infrared light devices and transilluminators have been developed to assist nurses in PVC insertion and have mainly been studied in the paediatric population, with heterogeneous results. 17 27 However, in the subpopulation of difficult-to-insert patients, these devices appear to improve infusion success compared with the traditional method. 19 21 These techniques also appear to improve success when performed by less experienced nurses. 23 24 The near-infrared light device is a non-invasive technique that uses infrared spectroscopy to project a real-time vein map onto the patient’s skin. Depending on the model, infrared light can penetrate up to 10 mm beneath the surface.\n\nOnly two studies conducted outside the ICU, one in adults in emergency departments and the other in adults with haemophilia patients requiring blood sampling, have shown no significant difference between the landmark approach and the vein-illuminating device. 25 26 This is probably because these patients have a low risk of difficult venous access, unlike critically ill patients in the ICU.\n\nTo our knowledge, no study has yet evaluated the usefulness of a vein illuminator in adult hospitalised patients in the ICU. We hypothesise that the use of a near-infrared light device in critically ill adult patients for whom a CVC is no longer indicated would increase the success rate of first-attempt peripheral venous line placement.\n\nMethods\n\nDesign\n\nThis investigator-initiated, prospective, multicentre, randomised controlled superiority trial compares the near-infrared light device to the landmark approach for PVC insertion in critically ill patients with an existing CVC. This protocol was reported in accordance with the standard protocol items: recommendations for interventional trials guidelines and checklist. 28\n\nOur main hypothesis is that near-infrared light improves the first-attempt success rate of PVC placement in adult critical care patients for whom a CVC is no longer indicated. A total of three hundred and eighty patients are to be randomised in two parallel groups.\n\nStudy setting\n\nThe trial is carried out in 4 French ICUs. The sponsor (Hospital University Centre of Orléans, France) delivers on-site training and support sessions throughout the study on all procedural aspects.\n\nRecruitment, informed consent and study timepoints\n\nPatients, or their relatives if they cannot be informed due to the patient’s condition, are informed of the study by a physician or nurse if they are eligible. The patient signs the consent form if possible; otherwise, the investigator signs to attest to the patient’s consent. If the patient is unable to consent, the relative signs the consent form, or if the relative is not present, the investigator signs to attest to the oral consent. A copy of the information letter and consent form is given to the relative as soon as possible. Copies of information sheets and consent forms are provided in the online supplemental materials .\n\nRefusal or consent is documented in the patient’s medical record. If consent is initially obtained from a relative, the patient’s consent to continue is sought as soon as possible.\n\nPatients who accept participation are declared enrolled and then are randomised. The date and time of randomisation determine the beginning of the intervention period.\n\nPatients have the right to withdraw their consent and discontinue their participation at any time for any reason.\n\nPatients and public involvement\n\nPatients and the public were not involved in the design, conduct, reporting or dissemination plans of this research.\n\nBlinding\n\nBlinding of participants, clinical investigators and assessors is not possible due to the nature of the intervention.\n\nRandomisation\n\nA centralised web-based management system (EOL Random, Medsharing, France) is used for randomisation. Patients are allocated to either the near-infrared light device or the landmark approach for peripheral venous access in a 1:1 ratio using block sizes unknown to the investigators. Stratification is based on the centre and anticipated difficulty of peripheral venous access.\n\nAnticipated difficulty is defined by at least one of the following criteria: upper limb oedema, absence of palpable veins with tourniquet application, obesity (BMI >30 kg/m²), or an increase in body weight of >10% between admission and inclusion.\n\nThe group to which the patient is assigned is recorded in the patient’s medical chart, and a dedicated chart gathering the whole randomised trial population.\n\nEligibility criteria\n\nInclusion criteria\n\nEligible patients must:\n\nNon-inclusion criteria\n\nIntervention\n\nFigure 1 presents the study outline and interventions.\n\nAll nurses received formal training on the device, followed by a 1-month familiarisation period prior to the start of the study.\n\nOnce enrolled and randomised, the nurse in charge sets up the PVC according to the patient’s randomisation group as soon as possible.\n\nThe study consists of two phases:\n\nIntervention group (near-infrared light device for PVC insertion)\n\nThe study is conducted using the AccuVein AV500 vein illuminator (AccuVein, New York, USA).\n\nFor patients in this group, nurses must locate the target vein for PVC insertion using the near-infrared light device. A tourniquet is applied, and the light is focused on one of the upper limbs. The recommended projection distance is approximately 20 cm, though it may vary between 10 and 45 cm.\n\nOnce the vein is identified, the nurse disinfects the site and performs the insertion with the device switched on, projecting the venous network map directly onto the patient’s skin. A 10 cc flash of isotonic solution (NaCl 0.9%) is administered at the end of catheterisation to confirm perfusion functionality.\n\nControl group (landmark approach for PVC insertion)\n\nPVC is inserted using the landmark approach: the vein is located with a tourniquet, and techniques to enhance vein visualisation (eg, alcohol-soaked compresses, vein tapping) are permitted.\n\nThe nurse then proceeds with the standard procedure, disinfecting the puncture site and performing catheterisation. A 10 cc flash of isotonic solution (NaCl 0.9%) is administered at the end of catheterisation to confirm perfusion functionality.\n\nOutcome measurements\n\nThe primary objective is to compare the first-attempt success rate of PVC placement in adult critical care patients for whom a central catheter is no longer indicated.\n\nSuccessful PVC placement is defined by venous return in the reflux chamber during catheterisation, complete catheter insertion and the administration of a flash of isotonic solution (NaCl 0.9%) without extravasation. An attempted puncture is defined as the catheter breaking through the skin barrier. During a puncture, repositioning or changing the catheter’s direction is allowed. Peripheral venipuncture will only be performed by nurses.\n\nA subgroup analysis will be conducted according to nurses’ experience, categorised into three groups: ‘<1 year post certification’, ‘1–5 years post certification’ and ‘>5 years post certification’.\n\nThe secondary objectives are to compare the two groups:\n\nStudy safety, monitoring and data management\n\nFor this research, we did not plan to set up an independent data safety and monitoring board.\n\nPatients are expected to be included during a 24-month period starting in February 2024. The duration of participation for each patient in the protocol is 7 days maximum after randomisation. The first patient was included in dates in February 2024.\n\nResearch assistants appointed by the sponsor regularly monitor all the centres on site to check adherence to the protocol and the accuracy and completeness of the data recorded.\n\nData management is performed by the Direction de La Recherche, Hospital University Centre of Orléans. A centralised web-based management system (EOL Random, Medsharing, France) and a centralised electronic case report form (eCRF) are used (EOL, Medsharing, France). A blind review of data will be performed prior to locking the database.\n\nStudy timeline\n\nPatients are expected to be included during a 24-month period starting in February 2024.\n\nSample size\n\nThe literature reports heterogeneous first-attempt success rates for PVC insertion. In ICU patients, this rate is approximately 35%. 29 30 Among elderly critical care patients, it is estimated at around 40%, 27 while ultrasound-guided insertion achieves a 47% success rate. 29\n\nWe propose the following hypotheses:\n\nWith a 5% alpha risk and 80% power, a logistic regression model—including randomisation group, difficult venous access status and their interaction—indicates that 342 analysable patients are sufficient to demonstrate both the intervention’s effect and a significant interaction with difficult venous access status. 31\n\nConsidering a 10% rate of non-analysable patients (eg, patients whose condition evolves and require continued central venous access before any PVC attempt), the required sample size is 380 patients (190 per arm).\n\nStatistical analysis\n\nAnalyses will be conducted on a modified intention-to-treat, including only analysable patients who underwent the intervention and for whom the primary endpoint is available.\n\nComplication analysis following PVC insertion will be conducted in the subgroup of patients with successful placement within the first five attempts.\n\nPer-protocol analyses may be performed if any patients receive a PVC insertion method different from their allocated randomisation arm.\n\nThe analysis will include descriptive statistics for each quantitative variable, presented as mean and SD or median and quartiles, depending on the normality of the distribution. Deviations and the number of missing values will also be reported. Categorical variables will be expressed as frequencies with 95% CIs.\n\nAnalyses of the primary outcome—successful placement of a PVC on the first attempt—as well as all other binary categorical outcomes, will be performed using logistic regression, considering the treatment arm and stratification factors. Centre, ‘difficult venous access’ status, randomisation group and the interaction between randomisation group and ‘difficult venous access’ status will be included as fixed effect variables. The relative risk of first-attempt success between randomisation groups will be estimated using the OR with a 95% CI.\n\nThe subgroup analysis of the primary outcome according to nurses’ experience will be performed using a logistic regression model including the randomisation group, nurses’ experience, their interaction term and adjusted for the stratification factor.\n\nThe effect of the study intervention will be estimated separately in the ‘anticipated difficult venous access’ and ‘no difficult venous access’ subgroups, regardless of whether an interaction exists between the randomisation group and the ‘difficult venous access’ status. Additionally, these subgroups will be further analysed based on the number of difficulty criteria present at inclusion.\n\nThe time required (in minutes) for successful PVC placement, the number of attempts per patient, and all other continuous endpoints will be compared between the two arms using a Mann-Whitney U test, accounting for stratification. Additionally, the time to successful PVC insertion will be analysed using a multivariate Cox model, adjusted for centre and the ‘difficult venous access’ status, subject to verification of the proportional hazards assumption. Exploratory analyses will be conducted to assess the effect of the near-infrared light device based on potential criteria for difficult venous access.\n\nEthics and dissemination\n\nEthics approval\n\nThe study protocol and amendments were approved for all centres by the institutional review board of Orléans’ University Hospital Centre, as well as by the French ethics committee (Comité de Protection des Personnes Sud Ouest et Outre Mer II, Toulouse, France, number 2023-A00429-36).\n\nThe study is conducted in accordance with the current revision of the Declaration of Helsinki, 1996, International Conference on Harmonisation Note for Guidance on Good Clinical Practice and the applicable French regulatory requirements.",
