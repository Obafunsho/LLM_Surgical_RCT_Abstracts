  "full_text": "Introduction\n\nEsophageal cancer, a common malignant tumor of the gastrointestinal tract, which is the sixth leading cause of cancer-related deaths and the eighth most prevalent cancer worldwide 1 .Currently, surgery is the primary treatment for esophageal cancer. However, esophagectomy is known for its invasiveness, which often leads to multiple postoperative complications 2 .\n\nPostoperative delirium (POD), a state of mental and neurocognitive impairment characterized by disorientation and fluctuating levels of consciousness, caused by an emerging medical condition such as electrolyte imbalance or sepsis 3 . There are three subtypes of POD: hyperactive, hypoactive, and mixed 4 . hyperactive delirium was more easily detected in clinical practice, while patients with hypoactive delirium were often not recognized by clinical diagnosis due to the lack of obvious clinical symptoms 5 . Abnormal behavior and mood swings, sleep disturbances, and nutritional status associated with POD not only impact the patient’s recovery and quality of life but also lead to increased healthcare resource utilization and costs due to additional care and monitoring 6 – 9 .\n\nPOD is a serious problem, with an incidence of 9.2–50% among patients undergoing esophageal cancer surgery, according to a recent meta-analysis 10 . Furthermore, the occurrence of delirium was linked to cognitive impairment that could persist for months or even years after discharge 11 . Studies have been shown that patients with POD in esophageal cancer have a poor prognosis, with 5-year survival rates as low as 20%, and that clinical interventions to reduce the duration of POD were not effective in reducing the risk of death 12 , 13 . However, delirium was largely preventable 14 .Therefore, preventive nursing interventions for the development of POD in patients at high risk are necessary. Currently, there is limited research on the incidence of POD and its risk factors following esophageal cancer resection 10 , and there is a lack of risk identification tools for POD in patients undergoing this surgery. Thus, the development of a prediction model for POD risk in patients with esophageal cancer holds significant value.\n\nMachine learning algorithms have been increasingly applied to the medical field in recent years. Among them, the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) regression can effectively deal with the problem of multicollinearity and select the most explanatory variables among many. Through LASSO regression, a nomogram model can be constructed. Nomogram is the integration of multiple predictors on the same plane and the drawing of calibrated line segments in the same coordinate system according to a certain scale, which visually expresses the relationship between variables in the prediction model. Several studies had shown that the nomogram had a significant role in predicting the prognosis of patients with cancer, cardiovascular disease, and psychiatric system disorder 15 – 17 . This study aimed to develop a nomogram model for predicting delirium after esophagectomy for esophageal cancer, which could provide clinicians with a way to identify people at high risk of delirium in the postoperative period, and then to take appropriate interventions.\n\nResults\n\nCharacteristics of patients with and without delirium in training set and testing set\n\nAmong the 396 patients who underwent esophagectomy for esophageal cancer enrolled in this study, the mean of age was 68.7 ± 6.4 years (IQR, 79–87). Of these, 78.8% (312/396) were male and 21.2% (84/396) were female. The incidence of POD was 35.4% (140/396), and the median duration of hospitalization after surgery at follow-up was 17 days (IQR, 13–26). In addition, the analysis revealed that participants with POD were more likely to be male, non-smokers, non-alcohol drinkers, experience postoperative pain, have a surgery duration longer than 3 h, develop infections, and use opioids and dexmedetomidine, among other factors (Table 1 ). Moreover, we found that patients with POD had a significantly longer duration of hospitalization and duration of anesthesia compared to those without POD [Median (IQR),19.5 (14-32.2) vs. 16, (12-23), p = 0.001] and (mean ± SD, 269.9 ± 73.3 vs. 246.8 ± 69.1, p = 0.002) in Table 1 .\n\nFurthermore, the demographic characteristics and perioperative-related information of the training and testing set were compared. The analysis results revealed that the prevalence of POD in the training set cohort was 36.3% (101/278), while in the testing set cohort, it was 33.1% (39/118). The proportion of males and females in the training set was 78.1% and 21.9%, while in the testing set, it was 80.5% and 19.5%, respectively. The baseline characteristics of the participants were summarized in Table 2 .\n\nTypes, duration, and the beginning time of delirium\n\nAmong the 396 postoperative patients with esophageal cancer in our study, hyperactive delirium accounted for 85.71% (120/140) of the total delirium population, hypoactive delirium was found in 8 cases (5.7%), and mixed delirium accounted for 8.5% (12/140) of the total POD population as shown in Fig. 1 A. The first occurrence of POD was observed within 3 days in more than half of the patients. Within 7 days, 82.9% of POD cases occurred, and within 14 days, 95% occurred. Only a small number of patients (5%) experienced POD beyond 14 days in Fig. 1 B. Additionally, more than half (54.3%) of the participants had delirium lasting less than one day, while the intermittent duration of POD could extend up to 9 days in Fig. 1 C.\n\nSelection of predictors and construction of predictive models\n\nLasso regression analysis of these 32 variables yielded non-zero coefficients for the variables: postoperative pain, postoperative infections, use of dexmedetomidine, use of propofol, PNI and duration of mechanical ventilation (Table 3 and Fig. S1 ). Afterwards, multinomial logistic regression was performed to obtain independent risk factors corresponding to POD and the ROC curve values of each predictor variable were specifically shown in Table 3 . Furthermore, in order to make the results more intuitive, the various prediction indicators as well as the ROC curve of the model were plotted in Fig. S2 . Finally, a nomogram (Fig. 2 ) was constructed based on the identified factors.\n\nValidation evaluation of the model’s performance\n\nAs for the 396 postoperative esophageal cancer patients in this study, the calibration curves (Fig. 3 ), DCA curves (Fig. 4 ), and clinical impact curves (Fig. 5 ) of both the training set (A) and testing set (B) showed good agreement in predicting the risk of POD. The ROC curves based on the nomogram predictive model had an AUC value of 0.919 (95% CI: 0.885- 0.953) for the training set (Fig. 6 A) and an AUC value of 0.871 (95% CI: 0.802- 0.940) for the testing set (Fig. 6 B). Table S1 presented the results of AUC, Brier score, C-statistic and Hosmer-Lemeshow test. By internal 1000 times bootstrap validation, the optimism-adjusted AUC of the nomogram was 0.911 (95% CI: 0.878- 0.944). The optimism-adjusted Brier score was 0.137, which was similar to that in the primary training set. Furthermore, the favorable calibration of the nomogram was confirmed in the testing set cohort, with a Brier score of 0.115, C-statistic of 0.87 (0.79 to 0.93) and a nonsignificant Hosmer–Lemeshow test statistic ( p = 0.456 > 0.05). The predictive model consistently demonstrated higher net benefits than both the “intervene all” and “no intervention” strategies within the 10–90% risk threshold range in clinical practice, suggesting that this model has clear practical value in clinical settings (Table S2 ). Besides, Table S2 can be seen that when the threshold is within the range of 0.01 to 0.1, the model remains positive (NB) and the value is relatively high (0.35 to 0.32). Table S3 presents the sensitivity and specificity corresponding to the partial cut-off values based on the nomogram score. Patients with a score lower than 75.1 are classified as having a low risk of POD, while those with a score greater than 75.1 are classified as high-risk. Furthermore, based on this value, the training set and testing set were respectively divided into high-risk (> 75.1) and low-risk (< 75.1) groups. The logistic regression results indicated that compared with the low-risk group, the risk of POD occurrence in the high-risk group was significantly higher in the training set (OR: 38.345; 95% CI: 19.564- 79.644) and the testing set (OR: 8.206; 95% CI: 3.512 20.334) in Table S4 .\n\nAll these results consistently showed that the nomogram not only accurately predicted the incidence of POD in postoperative patients with esophageal cancer but also had a very practical clinical value.\n\nMethod of using nomogram\n\nAs you can see from Fig. 2 , each predictor corresponds to a specific score. This Nomogram is used by adding the scores of six independent risk factors for a given patient, with the highest score corresponding to a perfect score of 100. The total score represents a comprehensive score of the risk of developing POD, and the specific risk probability value can be obtained by drawing a vertical line down the score.\n\nThe calculation formula of the POD prediction model established in this study is as follows:\n\nScore = [Score of postoperative pain) × 33.595+ (Score of postoperative infection) × 16.773+ (Score of dexmedetomidine using) × 19.326+ (Score of propofol using) × 33.156+ (− 1.390 × PNI + 76.437) + 2.857 × mechanical ventilation duration]. And the postoperative pain is classified as no (0), yes (1); postoperative infection are classified as no (0), yes (1); dexmedetomidine using are classified as no (0) and yes (1); propofol using are classified as no (0), yes (1).\n\nDiscussion\n\nPOD is associated with various adverse complications, including prolonged hospitalization, long-term cognitive dysfunction, increased mortality, and decreased survival. Fortunately, studies had reported that up to 43% of delirium cases were to be prevented 18 . Therefore, early monitoring and recognition of delirium in postoperative esophageal cancer patients are crucial. In this study, we developed a delirium risk prediction model based on common clinical data from the hospital’s electronic health records (EHR), providing a reliable and objective assessment tool for medical professionals.\n\nIn this nomogram prediction model, six patient-related variables were represented by vertical lines and positioned accordingly to obtain a specific score. The cumulative scores of all six independent risk factors yielded an overall score, which reflected the individual event risk comprehensively. Through the nomogram, we could readily ascertain the probability of delirium risk for each patient. Based on the scoring results, clinicians could implement effective preventive measures for high-risk patients to mitigate delirium incidence.\n\nTo the best of our knowledge, current studies on the incidence and risk factors of POD among esophageal cancer patients have been inadequate 10 . Our study not only investigated the incidence and risk factors of delirium in this population but also developed the first prediction model for POD based on machine learning and common clinical data. The accuracy of our prediction model was confirmed through evaluation of ROC curves, DCA curves, clinical impact curves, and calibration curves. Furthermore, our findings revealed that the incidence of POD in postoperative esophageal cancer patients was 35.4%, which was similar to previously reported finding 19 .Delirium mostly occurred within 3 days after surgery and 95% of cases occurred within 14 days, which were consistent with previous studies 19 , 20 . Therefore, clinical professionals should pay particularly close attention to the likelihood of delirium occurring within 2 weeks postoperatively. It is important to note that the hyperactive subtype accounted for up to 85.71% of delirium cases in the study, which differed from other epidemiological studies on delirium where hypoactive delirium was predominantly reported. The concealment of hypoactive delirium symptoms may contribute to its difficulty in detection and tendency to be overlooked in clinical settings, whereas hyperactive delirium exhibits more pronounced manifestations that allow for easier identification by clinicians. Even though this phenomenon is very common in clinical settings. It is necessary for clinicians to pay more attention to the identification of hypoactive delirium.\n\nAfter adjusting for each of the other five important confounders, we learned postoperative pain, postoperative infections, use of dexmedetomidine, use of propofol, duration of mechanical ventilation and PNI were independent risk factors for POD in patients after resection of esophageal cancer. Study had reported that inadequately treated pain increased the likelihood of delirium by nine times compared to adequately treated pain 21 . Moreover, It was explained that the reason pain increases the chance of POD may be due to pain-induced dysfunction of the patient’s cortisol system, which prolonged the overactivity of inflammatory cytokines 22 . Postoperative infection served as one of the independent predictors. In our cohort, we found that infection was present in 64.6% of patients, and those with infections were 217% more likely to develop delirium. The inflammatory hypothesis is currently considered as one of the pathogenic mechanisms of delirium, with suggestions that it may be linked to the production of inflammatory mediators associated with infection. Inflammatory factors such as interleukins, C-reactive protein, and serum protein of S100-b, which were involved in the systemic immune response and further influence the communication between the periphery and the brain, may play an important role in the pathogenesis of delirium 23 , 24 .\n\nIn addition, the relationship between delirium and perioperative medications such as dexmedetomidine and propofol has been reported in recent years 25 , 26 . Propofol, a common general anesthetic drug used to maintain the patient’s anesthetic state during surgery, has been implicated in POD due to its ability to suppress central nervous system excitability and reduce the patient’s oxygenation state. Several studies 27 , 28 have shown that dexmedetomidine significantly reduced the chance of POD in patients compared with propofol. Nevertheless, whether dexmedetomidine could reduce clinical POD is still very controversial currently. In contrast, our findings informed us that dexmedetomidine not only increased the odds of POD in patients with esophageal cancer, but that the use of dexmedetomidine was 3.78 times more likely to result in delirium than in patients who did not use dexmedetomidine (OR: 3.78 ;95% CI:1.59-8.99). Besides, two randomized controlled trials 29 , 30 from the United States of dexmedetomidine and saline placebo in elderly patients undergoing major elective noncardiac surgery and in patients undergoing cardiac surgery with extracorporeal circulation, respectively, have both shown that dexmedetomidine infusions initiated at the time of induction of anesthesia and continued for 24 h and that dexmedetomidine infusions of no longer than 2 h during the operation did not reduce the probability of POD in patients.\n\nSimilarly, this study supported the findings of Habeeb-Allah et al.'s study, which demonstrated a significantly longer duration of mechanical ventilation in patients with POD 31 . It is widely recognized that the use of sedatives during mechanical ventilation and the need for prolonged periods of bed rest can lead to oversedation and disrupted sleep patterns in these patients. Additionally, patients undergoing mechanical ventilation often experience respiratory complications such as airway infections, pneumonia, inadequate oxygenation, and carbon dioxide retention. These factors contributed to the increased incidence of POD. Researcher proposed that health care providers should optimize the hospital environment, such as providing daytime stimulation for children or reducing sedation, which can help mitigate delirium in hospitalized children 32 . Furthermore, Interestingly, we also identified previously unreported protective factors for POD such as PNI. To date, we are the first study to propose a prognostic nutritional index as an independent protective factor for POD in postoperative patients with esophageal cancer, which is consistent with studies of POD in non-esophageal cancer populations 33 , 34 . PNI, calculated from routine blood samples, reflects both nutritional and inflammatory status, making it a reasonable predictor of POD risk.\n\nThere were still some limitations of this study that need to be pointed out. Firstly, as a single-center study conducted in the cardiothoracic surgery department of a general hospital in China, although the testing set and the training set were completely isolated during the research process, due to the single data source, the generalization of our research results to other cancer hospitals or clinical Settings in different countries may be limited. Second, the retrospective nature of the study and the possibility of missing important variables such as debilitation due to data limitations should be acknowledged, although we tried to consider as many confounding factors as possible. Third, the retrospective design may introduce selection bias (e.g., exclusion of patients with incomplete follow-up or unmeasured confounders). Finally, we must recognize that the assessment and documentation of delirium relies on clinicians and nurses, which may introduce retrospective bias in the assessment methodology, particularly in identifying hypoactive delirium. Despite the clinical staff diagnosed POD according to the Prevention Consensus Statement developed by the ASER and POQI in this study, the heavy workload of the clinical staff and subtle manifestations of hypoactive POD were not obvious and difficult to detect, leading to a possible underestimation of our data collection. Therefore, to some extent, this study may be more applicable to predicting the risk of people with hyperactive delirium, not delirium overall. However, there is no doubt that the variables we enrolled in are data that are very easy and simple to obtain in the clinical setting. We look forward to inviting qualified psychiatrists to diagnose delirium in further multicentric prospective studies to supplement our findings.\n\nWe developed a nomogram model that can effectively predict the occurrence of POD in patients with esophageal cancer, which can provide reference for clinicians to take appropriate treatment and intervention measures for high-risk patients in time.\n\nMethods\n\nStudy population\n\nThis study was a single-center retrospective cohort study. The work has been reported in line with the TRIPOD statement 35 . In the study, we collected the medical records of hospitalized patients with esophageal cancer who underwent esophagectomy under general anesthesia at the Department of Cardiothoracic Surgery in the electronic health records of South Hospital, Jiangnan University Hospital, between November 2020, and June 2023.\n\nThe inclusion criteria for the study population were as follows: age greater than 18 years old; patients admitted to the Department of Cardiothoracic Surgery; patients diagnosed with esophageal cancer through clinical diagnosis; patients who underwent esophagectomy for esophageal cancer under general anesthesia and patients with complete clinical data. And patients were excluded from the study if they met any of the following criteria: presence of delirium or psychiatric disease at the time of admission; non-cardiothoracic surgical inpatients; patients with other concomitant tumors; patients who did not undergo surgical resection but only open thoracic exploration; combination of chemotherapy; re-hospitalization or re-admission and patients with incomplete clinical data.\n\nThe study was approved by the Medical Ethics Committee of Jiangnan University (approval number: JNU20221201IRB11). The need for obtaining informed consent has been waived by the Medical Ethics Committee of Jiangnan University due to the retrospective nature of this study. All patient data were anonymized during collection, storage and analysis, and the data were used only for research purposes without disclosing any personally identifiable information. The endpoint outcome event in the study was defined as the first occurrence of delirium. There were 32 risk factors included in this study, and each risk factor required 5–10 patients after esophageal cancer surgery 36 . The incidence of delirium was 50% according to the results of Takeuchi et al. 20 and considering a 10% loss to follow-up rate, (32 × 5/0.5)/0.9 = 356 patients should be included in this study. A total of 396 cases were included in the final sample, as depicted in Fig. 7 .\n\nDiagnosis of delirium\n\nPOD is an acute and fluctuating altered mental state characterized by a disturbance of attention (reduced ability to direct, maintain, focus, and divert attention) and awareness disorders (reduced orientation to the environment), occurring over a relatively short period of time (hours or days) 37 . It is accompanied by cognitive deficits such as memory, disorientation, language, visuospatial abilities, or perceptual deficits. POD in this study was diagnosed according to the Prevention Consensus Statement developed by the American Society for Accelerated Rehabilitation (ASER) and the Perioperative Quality Improvement Institute (POQI) 3 . The specific criteria are as follows: (a) A disturbance in attention (i.e. reduced ability to direct, focus, sustain and shift attention) and awareness (reduced orientation to the environment). (b) The disturbance develops over a short period of time (usually hours to a few days), represents a change from baseline attention and awareness, and tends to fluctuate in severity during the day. (c) An additional disturbance in cognition (e.g. memory deficit, disorientation, language, visuospatial ability or perception). The disturbances in criteria are a and c not better explained by another preexisting, established or evolving neurocognitive disorder. To be diagnosed with delirium, a patient must meet the three points (a, b and c). In the process of data collection and entry, all aspects of the patient’s records were consulted, including nursing records and medical records. And patients whose records included a diagnosis of delirium were included in the delirium population. Unlike hypoactive delirium, people with hyperactive delirium tend to be more active, and the disturbed emotional state may manifest as shouting, screaming, cursing, moaning, or making other sounds. Similarly, in contrast to hyperactive delirium, patients with hypoactive delirium exhibited apathy and reduced arousal. If the patient met any two of the following criteria, they were diagnosed with hypoactive delirium: sluggish response (response time to simple instructions more than 5 s), reduced spontaneous speech (fewer than 5 words per minute within 24 h or a 50% decrease from baseline), slowed movement (reduced speed of daily activities by 30% or more), and apathy. The participation rate of psychiatrists was 100% (for cases of uncertain POD). Moreover, patients with alternating hypoactive delirium and hyperactive delirium were considered to have mixed delirium. Experienced and trained nurses and physicians assessed all hospitalized patients for clinical delirium every 8 h (8:01 a.m. ~ 16:00 p.m., 16:01 p.m. ~ 24:00 a.m. the next day, and 0:01 a.m. ~ 8:00 a.m.) for 24 h after the patient’s surgery and before discharge. In addition, more frequent examinations were performed in case of sudden onset of abnormalities in attention, behavior, and consciousness.\n\nAssessments of potential predictors\n\nIn conjunction with clinical experience and previous literature 19 , 20 , 38 – 41 , we collected the following clinical data: age, gender, Body Mass Index (BMI), smoking, alcohol consumption, history of previous illnesses (hypertension, diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease, psychiatric disorders), tumor stage, tumor position, surgical incision (numbers), American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) score, operative time, anesthesia duration, blood transfusion, preoperative electrolytic and hydrological disorders, difficulty in sleeping, postoperative complications (postoperative hypoxemia, postoperative pain 21 , 42 , postoperative infection 43 , 44 , anastomotic fistula, pleural effusion, atrial fibrillation), Prognostic Nutritional Index (PNI), perioperative medications (opioids, benzodiazepines, dexmedetomidine 30 , and propofol 45 ), duration of ICU stay, duration of postoperative mechanical ventilation (the total number of hours from tracheal intubation to estuation divided by 24 (accurate to 0.1 days), and length of postoperative hospitalization (days).\n\nTumor stage was determined according to the 8th edition of the TNM staging atlas developed by the Union for International Cancer Control (UICC) 46 . Difficulty sleeping is defined as the patient complaining of tossing and turning, having difficulty falling asleep, and requesting sleep aid from the physician. Pulse oxygen below 90% or partial pressure of oxygen below 80 were considered hypoxemia. Postoperative pain was considered present if the patient had a postoperative Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) average scale score ≥ 4. The NRS scale score every 8 h for patients utilizing an analgesic pump (fentanyl). For patients with a pain score of 1–2 at the end of analgesia or those not using an analgesic pump, the assessment was performed once a day. Patients with a score of 3–4 were assessed twice a day, while those with a score greater than 4 were assessed three times daily. The pain scores in this study were calculated by averaging each patient’s pain scores two days after surgery. Postoperative infection was defined as the presence of chills and high fever after surgery, lung infection or a temperature greater than 37.5 °C or requiring medications to lower the temperature during the hospital stay. Pleural effusion is thought to be diagnosed by CT, X-ray, or ultrasound and atrial fibrillation was diagnosed after an electrocardiogram. Blood tests were routinely performed 2–3 days before surgery for each hospitalized patient. the calculation of PNI 47 : preoperative lymphocytes × 5 (10 9 /L) + preoperative serum albumin (g/dL). All of the above potential predictors were collected before the patients were diagnosed with POD, and information after the diagnosis of POD was not used in the construction of the predictive model.\n\nStatistical analysis\n\nIn this study, participants were grouped by whether or not they were presented with delirium and their baseline characteristics were compared. Continuous data are presented as mean ± standard deviation or median (quartiles), whereas categorical variables are presented as frequencies or percentages. Group comparisons of categorical variables were made using the Pearson chi-square test for adequate sample sizes and the Fisher exact probability method for smaller sample sizes. The Mann–Whitney U test was used for non-normally distributed continuous data, and the independent samples t-test was used for normally distributed data. In the modeling process of the prediction model, the data were first randomly stratified and divided into the training set and the testing set at a ratio of 7:3. The training set (70%) was used for the development and internal validation of the model, and the testing set (30%) was used to simulate the final generalization evaluation of the external validation environment. Single-factor logistic regression analyses were then performed on the participants who performed the training set to identify statistically significant variables associated with delirium in the training set. Then, LASSO regression analysis was conducted on these variables. Based on the traditional least square method, the L1 regularization term was introduced, and this value was incorporated into the loss function. Potential predictors were obtained by imposing penalties on the λ coefficients. Moreover, we combined the potential independent risk factors for postoperative delirium in esophageal cancer derived from multifactor logistic regression with their corresponding regression coefficients to construct a nomogram. During the validation of the prediction model, we not only conducted 1000 Bootstrap samplings with returns in the training set and randomly stratified and divided the training set into 10 equal molecular sets and cycled 10 times for cross-validation, but also evaluated the validity of the model by combining receiver operating characteristic curves (ROC), calibration curves, decision curves analysis (DCA), and clinical impact curves. Finally, in order to make the results more intuitive, the validity of the prediction model was verified by using the methods of AUC, Brier score and Hosmer-Lemeshow test respectively. All statistical analyses were performed using R software ( http://www.r-project.org ; version 4.2.2, R Foundation) and Free Statistics (Free Statistics 1.7). A two-sided P value of less than 0.05 indicates a statistically significant difference.\n\nElectronic supplementary material\n\nBelow is the link to the electronic supplementary material.\n\nSupplementary Material 1",
