  "abstract": "The American Heart Association (AHA)/American College of Cardiology (ACC) performance measurement sets serve as vehicles to accelerate translation of scientific evidence into clinical practice. Measure sets developed by the AHA/ACC are intended to provide practitioners and institutions that deliver cardiovascular services with tools to measure the quality of care provided and identify opportunities for improvement. Writing committees are instructed to consider the methodology of performance measure development 1 , 2 and to ensure that the measures developed are aligned with AHA/ACC clinical practice guidelines. The writing committees are also charged with constructing measures that maximally capture important aspects of care quality, including timeliness, safety, effectiveness, efficiency, equity, and patient-centeredness, while minimizing, when possible, the reporting burden imposed on hospitals, practices, and practitioners. Potential challenges from measure implementation may lead to unintended consequences. The manner in which challenges are addressed is dependent on several factors, including the measure design, data collection method, performance attribution, baseline performance rates, reporting methods, and incentives linked to these reports. The ACC/AHA Joint Committee on Performance Measures (Joint Committee) distinguishes performance measures from quality measures. Performance measures are generally selected from the highest level of evidence, usually from Class 1 or 3 recommendations of clinical practice guidelines. They are commonly used for national quality improvement efforts, public reporting, and pay-for-performance programs. In contrast, quality measures may not have as much evidence base and generally comprise metrics that may be useful for local quality improvement but are not yet appropriate for public reporting or pay-for-performance programs. New measures are initially evaluated for potential inclusion as performance measures. In some cases, a measure is insufficiently supported by the clinical practice guidelines. In other instances, when the clinical practice guidelines support a measure, the writing committee may feel it is necessary to have the measure tested to identify the consequences of measure implementation. Quality measures then may be promoted to the status of performance measures as supporting evidence becomes available. P.
