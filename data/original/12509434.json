  "abstract": "BACKGROUND:: Apneic oxygenation with high-flow nasal oxygen is a novel intraoperative respiratory support strategy for patients undergoing general anesthesia, but data about its clinical effects are scarce. We conducted a randomized trial to assess whether high-flow nasal oxygen is noninferior to mechanical ventilation through a laryngeal mask in terms of success rate of intraoperative respiratory support among patients undergoing a 30-minute general anesthesia session.\n\nMETHODS:: Single-center, randomized, noninferiority trial conducted in Italy between May 2022 and June 2023 and involving American Society of Anesthesiologists class I and II patients undergoing general anesthesia for operative hysteroscopy. Participants were randomized to receive laryngeal mask ventilation (volume-controlled ventilation to obtain end-tidal carbon dioxide between 35 and 45 mm Hg, inhaled oxygen fraction to achieve peripheral oxygen saturation greater than 95%) or high-flow nasal oxygen (70 L per minute, inhaled oxygen fraction of 100%) for intraoperative respiratory support. Patients received general anesthesia with propofol target-controlled infusion without neuromuscular blockade. Primary outcome was intraoperative respiratory support success rate, which was defined as peripheral oxygen saturation greater than 94% and transcutaneous carbon dioxide lower than 65 mm Hg with no need for rescue airway interventions for the entire procedure. Secondary outcomes included the rate of airway-related complications (including need for bag-mask or laryngeal mask ventilation, or tracheal intubation), postoperative respiratory symptoms, and postoperative dyspnea.\n\nRESULTS:: All 180 patients who were randomized completed the trial (90 patients in each group). Median [interquartile range] anesthesia duration was 25 [20–36] minutes in high-flow group and 32 minutes [27–44] in the laryngeal mask group. Intraoperative respiratory support was successful in 89 patients (99%) in both groups (absolute difference 0, unilateral 95% confidence interval, 3%, noninferiority P < .001). Incidence of postoperative respiratory symptoms was significantly lower in high-flow versus laryngeal mask group (2% vs 19%, P < .001), while airway-related complications and postoperative dyspnea were not different. Intraoperative transcutaneous carbon dioxide was significantly higher in high-flow group, with 43% of patients showing values greater than 55 mm Hg.\n\nCONCLUSIONS:: High-flow nasal oxygen is noninferior to laryngeal mask ventilation for intraoperative respiratory support during 30-minute general anesthesia without muscle paralysis. The risk of hypercarbia warrants careful patient selection and monitoring.",

  "full_text": "BACKGROUND\n\nUse of high-flow nasal oxygen (HFNO), which involves the delivery of heated and humidified oxygen-enriched air at flow rates between 40 and 70 L/min through dedicated nasal cannula, is common in critically ill patients with high respiratory demand. 1 Recently, this technique has found application in the field of anesthesiology. 2\n\nEvidence supporting the efficacy of HFNO in the perioperative setting has expanded, showing promising outcomes in various clinical settings, including difficult airway management, procedural sedation for endoscopic procedures, cardiac device implantation, sedated hysteroscopy for assisted reproduction, and brief laryngeal surgery under general anesthesia. 2\n\nOperative hysteroscopy, a common procedure for investigating abnormal uterine bleeding, performing biopsies, treating endometrial lesions, or evaluating uterine reproductive capacities, is typically conducted in a day-surgery regimen under general anesthesia with ventilation facilitated by face or laryngeal masks. 3 While laryngeal masks offer effective airway management and allow for hands-free operation by the anesthesiologist, challenges such as improper placement and associated complications do exist. 4 In a pilot study, we demonstrated that HFNO as sole respiratory support technique may be a safe and feasible alternative for oxygenation and CO 2 washout during a 30-minute general anesthesia session without muscle paralysis 5 ; potential benefits of this approach would be lower invasiveness and simpler bedside use. However, no study ever assessed whether intraoperative respiratory support with HFNO may be noninferior to conventional mechanical ventilation through laryngeal mask during short-duration general anesthesia in terms of patient-centered clinically relevant outcomes.\n\nWe conducted a randomized trial to assess whether HFNO is noninferior to mechanical ventilation through a laryngeal mask in terms of overall success of intraoperative respiratory support during hysteroscopic surgery.\n\nMETHODS\n\nStudy Oversight\n\nThis single-center randomized trial was conducted in a university hospital in Rome, Italy, between September 2022 and June 2023. This study was approved by the University’s Institutional Review Board (ID number: 4872, protocol number 15190/22), and written informed consent was obtained from all subjects participating in the trial. The trial was registered before patient enrollment at clinicaltrials.gov ( NCT05550584 ), Principal investigator: Luciano Frassanito, Date of registration: September 20, 2022). The study was conducted following the guidelines of the Declaration of Helsinki.\n\nPatients\n\nAmerican Society of Anesthesiologists physical status I and II adult patients aged <70 years old, scheduled for elective operative hysteroscopy, were considered for enrollment. Exclusion criteria were New York Heart Association class > II, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) with long-term oxygen therapy, obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS), body mass index (BMI) >30, pregnancy, preexisting cardiac arrhythmias, chronic renal failure, neuromuscular diseases, anticipated prolonged (≥60 minutes) or complex hysteroscopies, upper airways disease.\n\nProcedures\n\nOn arrival in the operating room, patients were positioned in the lithotomic position. A peripheral venous cannula was inserted into the hand or forearm, and infusion of 500 ml Ringer Lactate solution commenced. Preoperatively, patients received Omeprazole 40 mg and Dexamethasone 4 mg.\n\nPatients were then randomized in 1:1 ratio to the HFNO or to the laryngeal mask ventilation group.\n\nRandomization was performed through a computer-based randomization sequence (Randomization.com) kept in sequentially numbered, opaque, sealed and stapled envelopes. Due to the characteristics of the devices and of the ventilation techniques, blinding was not possible.\n\nIn the HFNO group, preoxygenation was achieved using 100% oxygen delivered at 30 L/min with dedicated nasal cannula (THRIVE-Fisher and Paykel Healthcare) for 3 minutes. Subsequently, on induction of general anesthesia, oxygen flow was increased to 70 L/min and maintained throughout the procedure. Humidification chamber temperature was set at 31°C, 34 °C, or 37°C based on patient’s comfort.\n\nIn the event of oxygen saturation (Sp o 2 < 94%), transcutaneous carbon dioxide (tcCO 2 )>65 mm Hg, or hemodynamic instability, the attending anesthesiologist provided appropriate pharmacological or rescue interventions. In such cases, bag-and-mask ventilation or endotracheal intubation mechanical ventilation was allowed according to the preference of the attending anesthesiologist.\n\nIn the laryngeal mask group, preoxygenation was conducted for 3 minutes via a facial mask delivering 100% oxygen at 15 L/min. After induction of anesthesia, patients were mechanically ventilated through an I-Gel laryngeal mask connected to a mechanical ventilator, which was set in volume-controlled mode. Settings were as follows: tidal volume of 8 ml/kg of predicted body weight; inspired oxygen fraction to maintain Sp o 2 ≥96%; positive end-expiratory pressure of 5 cmH 2 O; respiratory rate adjusted to maintain end-tidal CO 2 between 35 and 45 mm Hg. In case of desaturation (defined as Sp o 2 <94%) despite FiO 2 >80%, tracheal intubation was performed.\n\nIn both groups, general anesthesia was standardized. General anesthesia was induced using target-controlled infusion of propofol at an effect site concentration of 7 µg/ml through the Orchestra Infusion system (Fresenius Kabi, Bad Homburg, Germany), along with a bolus of fentanyl at 1 µg/kg. Anesthesia maintenance was obtained with target-controlled infusion of propofol at an effect site concentration of 4 µg/ml. Propofol infusion ceased on completion of surgery or when the patient met awakening criteria.\n\nPostoperatively, patients received Acetaminophen 1g, Ondansetron 4 mg, and Ketorolac 30 mg as part of routine clinical practice. Patients were transferred to the Post Anesthesia Care Unit at the end of the procedure, and discharged after 3 hours of postoperative monitoring if no complications occurred.\n\nStandard intraoperative monitoring included noninvasive blood pressure measurement, 3-lead electrocardiogram, pulse oximetry, and bispectral index monitoring. Sp o 2 , heart rate and tcCO 2 was continuously monitored through the Tosca TCM5 monitor (Radiometer, Germany) in both study groups. After appropriate placement of the sensor on the earlobe, tcCO 2 was measured at 1-second intervals. Data on Sp o 2 , tcCO 2 and heart rate were recorded and stored on a personal computer for offline review.\n\nData on patient baseline characteristics, comorbidities, surgery indications, laryngeal mask positioning, anesthesia duration, surgical duration, and postoperative hospital stay were collected. Oxygenation, ventilatory, and hemodynamic parameters were recorded during surgery.\n\nOutcomes\n\nThe primary outcome measure of the trial was intraoperative respiratory support success rate. Success was defined as Sp o 2 ≥ 94%, tcCO 2 <65 mm Hg, and no need for rescue airway interventions during the entire procedure. An assessor blinded to study group assignment reviewed a posteriori recorded data on Sp o 2 , heart rate, and tcCO 2 to determine whether the patient had met the criteria to define the primary outcome.\n\nSecondary outcomes included airway-related complications (including any of the following: need for bag-mask ventilation, laryngeal mask ventilation or tracheal intubation during the procedure), postoperative respiratory symptoms (including any of the following: cough, sore throat, dysphagia, dysphonia, laryngospasm, oxygen desaturation defined as Sp o 2 <94% after the end of surgery) and postoperative dyspnea (Borg Dyspnea Score>0). As safety end points, we also evaluated Sp o 2 and tcCO 2 values over the course of the study, the duration of surgery and duration of anesthesia in the 2 study groups. Secondary outcomes were evaluated in a standard manner, assuming no difference between groups as null hypothesis and bilateral confidence intervals (CIs). All other outcomes should be considered as exploratory. No adjustment for multiple comparisons was performed.\n\nSample Size Calculation and Statistical Analysis\n\nSample size calculation was based on the results of a preliminary feasibility pilot study. 5 Based on these data, we estimated a 95% success rate both for HFNO and laryngeal mask ventilation. For a unilateral 95% CI and a power of 90%, 82 was the minimal number of patients per group to demonstrate noninferiority, whose limit of clinical relevance was assumed to be 10%. The sample was increased to 90 patients per group to take into account a 10% dropout rate.\n\nData are displayed as mean ± standard deviation or median (interquartile range) for numerical data or number of events (%) for categorical data. The normality distribution of numerical data was assessed with Shapiro–Wilk test and visually by histograms.\n\nThe balance of baseline characteristics between the 2 randomization groups was evaluated with absolute standardized differences (ASD), using means for continuous data and proportions for categorical data. Variables with ASD higher than 1.96·√(2/n) = 0.292 were considered imbalanced (n = 90, group sample size).\n\nThe Farrington-Manning test was used for the primary outcome analysis. It estimates a Z-statistic for rate differences adjusted for the noninferiority margin (δ = 0.1): the null hypothesis was that the true rate difference of control minus HFNO group was ≥0.1, while the alternative hypothesis (alternative = “less”) that this value is smaller than the prespecified margin. 6 Continuous variables were compared with Student T-test or Mann Whitney test, as appropriate; equality of variance was evaluated with the variance ratio test; categorical variables were evaluated with the χ 2 test or Fisher exact test in case of expected frequencies<5. Intergroup differences are displayed as absolute risk differences with 95% CIs for categorical variables while continuous, not normally distributed variables were compared using 2-sample Wilcoxon rank-sum test and Hodges–Lehman estimation of location shift with corresponding asymptotic 95% CI.\n\nContinuous data regarding tcCO 2 and Sp o 2 were analyzed with ANOVA for repeated measures: mean (±standard deviation) are displayed along with intergroup differences and 95% CIs.\n\nData were analyzed according to an intention-to-treat principle.\n\nP -values < .05 were considered statistically significant. Data analysis was performed using R (R Foundation for Statistical Computing; version 4.1.2, packages used: Rcmdr, dplyr, tidyr, ggplot2, effectsize, stddiff, fmsb, DescrTab2).\n\nRESULTS\n\nBetween May 2022 and June 2023, 241 patients were assessed for eligibility: of these, 180 were consented and randomized to the HFNO or laryngeal mask group (Figure 1 ). All randomized patients completed the study.\n\nParticipants’ demographics and clinical characteristics are displayed in Table 1 : the 2 cohorts were well balanced except for BMI, slightly higher in the LMA group compared to the HFNO group [24 (4) kg/m 2 vs 23 (3) kg/m 2 , ASD 0.322].\n\nAll patients in the HFNO group received pure oxygen at a flow rate of 70 L per minute. In patients in the laryngeal mask group, median [interquartile range] tidal volume and respiratory rate were 400 mL [375–425] and 13 breaths per minute [12–14].\n\nStudy outcomes are reported in Table 2 .\n\nPrimary Outcome\n\nThe success rate was 0.99 (89/90 patients) for both groups with absolute difference 0; the upper limit of the unilateral 95% CI was 0.038. For HFNO, this was less than the assigned noninferiority margin of 0.1 with p for noninferiority 0.001 (Figure 2 ).\n\nOne patient in the HFNO reached tcCO 2 >65 mm Hg, and bag-mask ventilation was successfully applied to revert hypercarbia. One patient in the laryngeal mask group required intubation due to severe laryngospasm and desaturation (minimum Sp o 2 87%), reasonably because of fluid overload to expand the uterine cavity.\n\nSecondary Outcomes\n\nThe number of patients that experienced postoperative respiratory symptoms in the postanesthesia care unit arrival was 2 (2%) in the HFNO group vs 19 (21%) in the laryngeal mask group, a difference that was statistically significant (absolute difference −19 % [95% CI, −28 to −10], P < .001), with a mild sore throat being the most frequently reported symptom by patients in the latter group. The incidence of postoperative dyspnea and the need for O 2 supplementation for transient desaturation was not different between groups.\n\nExploratory Outcomes\n\nDuration of surgery was comparable between the 2 groups; duration of anesthesia was 25 minutes [20–36] in HFNO group and 32 [27–44] minutes in laryngeal mask group, a difference that was statistically significant (mean difference −7 minutes [95% CI, −10 to −4]); patients in HFNO group had also shorter time from induction of anesthesia to insertion of hysteroscope and shorter time to end of surgery to arousal.\n\nThe time course of Sp o 2 and tcCO 2 absolute values is shown in the Supplemental Digital Content, Supplemental Figures 1–2, https://links.lww.com/AA/F365 . Average intraoperative Sp o 2 was slightly but significantly higher in HFNO versus laryngeal mask group: 99.8% (±0.6%) vs 99.4% (±0.6%), mean difference 0.4% [95% CI, 0.2–0.6], ANOVA P < .001 (Figure 3 ). While tcCO 2 was remarkably stable in the laryngeal mask group during the procedure, it increased steadily in the first 5 minutes after induction of anesthesia in the HFNO group and then plateaued. Overall, average intraoperative tcCO 2 was significantly higher in HFNO versus laryngeal mask group: 42 mm Hg (±5 mm Hg) vs 36 mm Hg (±5 mm Hg), mean difference 6 mm Hg [95% CI, 4–8], ANOVA P < .001 (Figure 3 ). Median peak intraoperative tcCO 2 during anesthesia in the HFNO group was 51 (47–56) mm Hg: overall, 32% of the patients reached tcCO 2 in the 55–60 mm Hg range and 11% reached tcCO 2 in the 60 to 65 mm Hg range for. After the end of surgery, tcCO 2 rapidly decreased but, at the end of anesthesia, it was still higher in HFNO group (Table 2 and Figure 3 ).\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nIn this randomized trial, HFNO was not inferior to laryngeal mask ventilation in enhancing successful respiratory management of patients undergoing operative hysteroscopy under general anesthesia without neuromuscular blockade. The requirement for rescue interventions during the intraoperative period was comparable to that of patients receiving mechanical ventilation through a laryngeal mask. However, average transcutaneous CO 2 was higher in patients receiving HFNO, and a significant proportion of patients developed significant hypercarbia: accordingly, careful patient selection and monitoring is needed during the treatment.\n\nHysteroscopic surgery is often performed under general anesthesia, with laryngeal mask ventilation being a common method to ensure airway patency. 7 However, despite its ease of use, laryngeal mask ventilation can pose risks such as incorrect positioning, which may lead to air leaks and potential hypoventilation. Other risks include partial airway obstruction, aspiration, pneumonia, laryngeal trauma, and injuries to the tongue, nerves, or vocal cords. 8\n\nIn this context, HFNO may offer an attractive alternative, allowing the administration of 40 to 70 L/min of fully heated and humidified air/oxygen mixture at a predetermined FiO 2 through specifically designed nasal prongs. 2 , 8 – 12 Compared to conventional oxygen therapy, HFNO limits oxygen desaturation, need for airway interventions, and procedure interruption in patients undergoing surgery under sedation without tracheal intubation. 13 , 14 Accordingly, this approach has been proposed to extend safe apnea time during periods of muscular inactivity, demonstrating a delayed onset of hypoxemia and reduced CO 2 retention compared to traditional apneic oxygenation techniques. 11 , 15 – 17 Despite several studies investigated CO 2 dynamics during apneic oxygenation, 13 , 18 , 19 the precise mechanisms governing gas exchange under these conditions remain not fully understood. 12 , 20 Nevertheless, hypercarbia represents the most relevant drawback of HFNO use during general anesthesia, and its occurrence is proportional to the time of apnea and independent from applied flows. 18 Conversely, the possibility to generate adequate alveolar ventilation with CO 2 washout is the greatest advantage of laryngeal mask ventilation. Few clinical trials compared HFNO with laryngeal mask ventilation during general anesthesia. Moreover, while several studies assessed the efficacy of HFNO in terms of intraoperative oxygenation and CO 2 washout, none of them systematically investigated HFNO efficacy on more relevant patient-centered clinical outcomes, as the overall success of intraoperative respiratory support or the need for rescue interventions because of inadequate oxygenation/ventilation. 21 , 22\n\nOur study revealed that only 1 patient per group required rescue interventions due to these intraoperative complications. In the HFNO group, this was due to the occurrence of hypercarbia; in the laryngeal mask ventilation group, this occurred due to arterial desaturation requiring tracheal intubation. Both patients were successfully treated without postoperative complications. Importantly, the incidence of postoperative respiratory symptoms (including cough, sore throat, dysphagia, dysphonia, laryngospasm or oxygen desaturation) was significantly lower in the HFNO group, suggesting enhanced comfort. Moreover, duration of anesthesia (approximately 30 minutes) was significantly lower in the HFNO group, mostly due to shortened induction and arousal times linked to the simpler respiratory support technique used. Overall, these results indicate that, in patients undergoing general anesthesia without muscle paralysis, HFNO use has an acceptable safety profile, with potential benefits on patient-related clinical outcomes.\n\nOur results are consistent with HFNO physiological mechanisms of action, which include efficient oxygenation and some CO 2 washout. 11 HFNO optimizes apneic oxygenation because the high flows optimize alveolar partial pressure of O 2 , which remains higher than that in the blood: this facilitates continuous oxygen transfer. This is consistent with the alveolar gas equation, which implies adequate oxygenation in case of a continuous flow of O 2 in patent airways, even without alveolar ventilation. 15 , 23 – 29 Moreover, the high flows generate some expiratory pressure preventing or counterbalancing atelectasis, 23 which otherwise yield interindividually variable lung volume loss. 25 , 30 Accordingly, strong evidence supports HFNO as a technique to prolong apnea time with adequate oxygenation. Conversely, progressive development of respiratory acidosis due to CO 2 retention, which occurs at an approximative rate of 3 to 5 mm Hg per minute, is the factor that mostly curtails HFNO effectiveness. 18 – 20 , 31 In our study, average tcCO 2 values were significantly higher in the HFNO group, while no clinically meaningful differences were detected in Sp o 2 values. This is consistent with other investigations on the topic. 32 , 33 In our cohort, 1 patient in HFNO group required rescue interventions to treat clinically relevant hypercarbia, but a relevant proportion of patients developed tcCO 2 >55 mm Hg. This warrants accurate patient selection and monitoring.\n\nOverall, however, our findings indicate a median tcCO 2 peak value of 51 mm Hg in the HFNO group; HFNO generates CO 2 washout due to continuous-flow induced dead space clearance and some alveolar ventilation favored by the interaction between turbulent supraglottic flow vortices and cardiogenic oscillations. 19 , 34 Notably, after a progressive rise in tcCO 2 values during the first 10 minutes of surgery, these values then stabilized for the rest of the procedure. The most likely explanation for this particular CO 2 behavior lies in the possible resumption of some spontaneous ventilatory activity after a threshold of hypercarbia was achieved. 35 This hypothesis is supported by the physiology of the interplay between hypnotic agents and respiratory drive in the absence of muscle paralysis: hypnotic agents do not necessarily abolish spontaneous breathing; rather, they reduce the responsiveness of neural centers to hypercarbia. The respiratory drive is then triggered when the pH in the cerebrospinal fluid falls to a lower level. 36 – 38 The understanding of the exact mechanism behind this phenomenon warrants further confirmatory investigations. Overall, however, 43% of patients receiving HFNO showed tcCO 2 values greater than 55 mm Hg. Further research is also needed to establish what patients are at higher risk of developing hypercarbia during the treatment, which would allow more proper patient selection and treatment individualization.\n\nStrengths of our study include the use of patient-centered outcomes to establish noninferiority, and the blinded evaluation a posteriori of Sp o 2 and tcCO 2 tracings to mitigate the influence of the open-label design on primary end point assessment. Additionally, the standardized methods for administering general anesthesia and conducting study procedures enhance both reproducibility and external validity, particularly for general anesthesia for other surgical procedures having similar duration.\n\nOur study has limitations: first, the absence of blood gas analysis may have underestimated the increase in Pa co 2 in HFNO group; however, continuous assessment of Pa co 2 is not always feasible in clinical practice, especially in a day-case mini-invasive surgery setting. A method to estimate CO 2 levels during the intraoperative use of HFNO is end-tidal CO 2 levels. However, this approach is prone to significant error and may underestimate the actual CO 2 accumulation rate by as much as 50%. 39 Differently, tcCO 2 offers a reliable and noninvasive alternative, providing accurate Pa co 2 estimation. 40 Second, the single-center design, which may restrict the generalizability of our results: however, the methodology followed strict and standardized procedures that are fully detailed in this article; this should facilitate reproducibility of the findings also in other centers. Third, all patients were female; however, we deem there is no reason to hypothesize that male patients would follow different respiratory physiology, and hence behave differently. Fourth, accurately identifying the eventual resumption of spontaneous ventilatory activity in the HFNO group was not possible. Fifth, the exclusion of patients with obesity, COPD, or known or suspected OSAS—conditions associated with a higher risk of airway closure after anesthesia and hypoventilation when exposed to elevated inspired oxygen fractions—limits the generalizability of our findings. These risks stem from mechanisms such as impaired hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction, the Haldane effect, absorption atelectasis, and worsened ventilation-perfusion mismatch. 41 , 42 Further research is needed to evaluate whether our results are applicable to this patient population. Sixth, noninferiority was established based on clinically acceptable tcCO 2 threshold of 65 mm Hg, which is liberal and somehow arbitrary; the acceptability of this choice was supported by the absence of complications or CO 2 retention in any patient after surgery, reinforcing the validity of this definition. Finally, the use of HFNO entails the consumption of 70 L of pure oxygen per minute, leading to significant environmental and economic costs. Whether these costs are acceptable remains to be established, particularly in the absence of clear benefits on robust patient-related outcomes when compared to a safe and effective alternative such as the laryngeal mask. Properly designed studies are warranted to investigate HFNO overall cost-effectiveness in the context of general anesthesia.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nDuring general anesthesia without muscle paralysis, HFNO proved to be noninferior to laryngeal mask ventilation in terms of intraoperative respiratory support success, with similar needs for rescue interventions.\n\nDISCLOSURES\n\nConflicts of Interest: L.
