  "abstract": "Objective: This study aimed to: (1) investigate the hemodynamic characteristics of type II endoleaks using mathematical simulations based on pharmacokinetic analysis; and (2) validate the simulation results using clinical data from four-dimensional computed tomography (4D-CT) to assess the relationship between time-enhanced curves (TECs) and aneurysm enlargement.\n\nMethods: A mathematical model was created to simulate the hemodynamics of type II endoleaks, incorporating nine compartments representing various cardiovascular components. Simulations were performed under different conditions, leading to the classification of endoleaks into four hemodynamic types. Clinical data were collected from 45 patients who underwent 4D-CT scans at a single center between April 2017 and April 2022. The study cohort included two groups: 20 patients with type II endoleaks identified within 1 week after endovascular aortic repair and 25 patients with persistent type II endoleaks diagnosed during follow-up imaging ranging from 6 months to 9 years post endovascular aortic repair. To evaluate aneurysm volume changes, follow-up CT scans were conducted 6 months or 1 year after the 4D-CT. The primary outcome was evaluating the consistency between simulation results and clinical TEC data obtained from 4D-CT. The secondary outcomes assessed the relationship between individual TEC parameters derived from clinical TEC data and aneurysm enlargement.\n\nResults: The mathematical simulations successfully classified type II endoleaks into four hemodynamic types. Clinical validation showed a high concordance between simulation and clinical TEC shapes. A significant difference was observed in various TEC parameters between the stable and enlarged groups. The simulation-based analysis revealed a strong association between aneurysm enlargement and the most informative parameters, including 80% enhancement duration (area under the curve [AUC], 0.88; sensitivity, 0.87; specificity, 0.80; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.779-0.990; cutoff, 16.9), peak-to-peak time feeder (AUC, 0.78; sensitivity, 0.93; specificity, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.621-0.937; cutoff, 13.0), and upslope (AUC, 0.86; sensitivity, 0.73; specificity, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.740-0.972; cutoff, 11.7).\n\nConclusions: This study utilized mathematical simulations and clinical validation to characterize the hemodynamics of type II endoleaks. The results demonstrate the strong association of TEC parameters, derived from 4D-CT, with aneurysm enlargement, highlighting their potential for guiding timely intervention in clinical practice.",

  "full_text": "Methods\n\nThe design of the type II endoleaks model\n\nThe simulation of the aorta, feeder, and EC involved the use of mathematical simulations with pharmacokinetic analysis. 31 , 32 , 33 A compartmental model comprising nine compartments was designed to simplify type II endoleaks, including the right heart, pulmonary circulation, left heart, aorta, peripheral arteries, venous system, feeder, EC, and drainer ( Fig 1 ). Certain anatomical elements were simplified to ensure computational feasibility while preserving essential flow characteristics. Specifically, structures such as the aortic arch vessels and smaller branches of the peripheral arteries were grouped into larger compartments to avoid unnecessary complexity. This approach ensures the model captures the critical flow dynamics relevant to the endoleak and surrounding vasculature.\n\nUnlike a fully detailed physiological model that accounts for every vessel and branch, this model focuses on the primary components involved in the endoleak process. The feeder and drainer are vessels branching from the EC, where the feeder represents the inflow pathway supplying blood to the EC, and the drainer facilitates outflow toward the venous system.\n\nIn this model, the feeder and the drainer are defined in the same manner as peripheral arteries. However, blood from the drainer does not flow directly into the peripheral arteries but instead follows an alternative path that eventually connects to the venous system, reflecting the altered flow dynamics observed in type II endoleaks.\n\nTo maintain clinical relevance while ensuring a simplified hemodynamic representation, the model assumes a single feeder and a single drainer, characteristic of a typical type II endoleak. This balance between physiological accuracy and computational efficiency is crucial for pharmacokinetic analysis of contrast medium, allowing for a practical yet representative assessment of flow dynamics in type II endoleaks.\n\nThe change in iodine content per unit of time in each plot was calculated using the Runge-Kutta method of the ninth order, employing a system of nine simultaneous differential equations. The simulation environment utilized a Microsoft Excel (Microsoft) add-in (Excel using Visual Basic for Applications: VBA).\n\nThe contrast medium concentration in each compartment was denoted as C , with C 0 representing the injected contrast medium, and subscripts such as C r for the right heart, C p for pulmonary circulation, C l for the left heart, C a for the aorta, C c for peripheral arteries, C v for the venous system, C f for the feeder, C E C for EC, and C d for the drainer. The blood volume ( V ) and flow ( Q ) in each compartment are represented with subscripts, as detailed in Fig 1 .\n\nThe coupled differential equations for each compartment are as follows:\n\nRight heart: V r ・ d C r d t = Q 0 C 0 − Q r C r + Q v C v\n\nPulmonary circulation: V p ・ d C p d t = Q r C r − Q p C p\n\nLeft heart: V l ・ d C l d t = Q p C p − Q l C l\n\nAorta: V a ・ d C a d t = Q l C l − Q a C a\n\nPeripheral arteries: V c ・ d C c d t = Q a − c C a − Q c C c\n\nVenous system: V v ・ d C v d t = Q c Q c k p + Q d Q d k p − Q v Q v k p\n\nFeeder: V f ・ d C f d t = Q a − f C a − Q f C f\n\nEC: V E C ・ d C E C d t = Q f C f − Q E C C E C\n\nDrainer: V d ・ d C d d t = Q E C C E C − Q d C d k p is the distribution coefficient between tissues and blood, and in this simulation, it was set to k p = 1 since the contrast medium does not transition into cells. 32\n\nSimulated TEC\n\nWe used the average values with 4D-CT to diagnose endoleaks after EVAR at our institution as simulation patient parameters. The circulatory blood volume was calculated using the Ogawa formula with input values of height: 155 cm and weight: 55 kg. The average age was 80 years, and the cardiac index was 2.4 L/min/m 2 . 34 Primary circulatory blood volume distribution was allocated: right heart: 3.5%, pulmonary circulation: 9%, left heart: 3.5%, aorta: 2%, peripheral arteries: 18%, venous system: 64%. 32 , 34 The circulatory blood volumes of the feeder, EC, and drainer were designed to be derived from the distribution of peripheral arteries. Based on clinical cases, the circulatory blood volumes of the feeder and drainer were set to 1 mL. Assuming various types of type II endoleaks, V E C was varied as 0.5, 1, 2, 4, and 8 mL, 26 and Q a − f was altered at ratios of 0.05, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, and 0.8% relative to the ejection volume of Q a 35 . Each set of varied parameters was simulated TEC for the feeder and EC. The shapes of TEC, the upslope and washout-slope at the onset of TEC, the iodine quantity in peak enhancement, and the iodine quantity in the equilibrium-phase were compared under each condition, and subtype classification was performed based on hemodynamic features. Notably, the vertical axis of TEC was expressed in iodine quantity (mgI) to mitigate the impact of CT system and scanning conditions because using CT number would be influenced by them.\n\nVerification in a clinical patient population\n\nThis study was a case-control single-center research approved by our institution's Institutional Review Board (approval number: 24-11-01-01, approval date: November 15, 2024). We identified patients in which 4D-CT was performed to diagnose the type of endoleaks and assess their detailed characteristics between April 2017 and April 2022 ( Fig 2 ).\n\nThe cohort consisted of 118 patients who underwent 4D-CT within 1 week after EVAR for type diagnosis and 25 patients with persistent type II endoleaks (diagnosed during short- to long-term follow-up, ranging from 6 months to 9 years after EVAR) who were evaluated with 4D-CT for detailed assessment.\n\nAmong the 118 patients who underwent 4D-CT within 1 week after EVAR, no endoleak was observed in 92 patients (78%), two patients (1.7%) had type I endoleak, 20 patients (16.9%) had type II endoleak, three patients (2.5%) had type III endoleak, and one patient (0.8%) had type IV endoleak.\n\nIn total, 45 patients were included in this study: 20 with type II endoleaks identified within 1 week after EVAR and 25 with persistent type II endoleaks (ranging from 6 months to 9 years post-EVAR). A persistent type II endoleak is defined as one that persists for more than 6 months. Patients in which the endoleaks had persisted for over 6 months at the time of 4D-CT imaging were classified as persistent type II endoleaks, whereas those that had not were classified as type II endoleaks.\n\nMüller-Wille et al 25 report that the enlargement of an aneurysm is defined as an increase in aneurysm volume of 5% or more during the follow-up period. Although some studies define aneurysm volume expansion as an increase of 5 mm or more, 36 or 2% or more, 23 we chose a 5% or more increase as a threshold to account for the potential influence of measurement location and inter-observer variability.\n\nWe categorized the patients into two groups based on follow-up CT scans conducted at 6 months or 1 year after the 4D-CT for type diagnosis of endoleaks: the enlarged group (14/45 patients) if the aneurysm volume increased by 5% or more and the stable group (31/45 patients) for patients with less than 5% volume expansion ( Table I ). The rate of aneurysm expansion refers to the percentage change in volume between the follow-up CT scan and the initial 4D-CT scan performed for endoleak diagnosis. The percentage change in aneurysm volume was calculated using the following formula:\n\nA 3D workstation (ZIOSTATION2, Ziosoft) was used to measure aneurysm volume, including the vascular lumen. Two radiologic technologists measured aneurysm volume, encompassing the region from the proximal to the distal part of the aneurysm, including the artery, and measured using a 3D workstation. The average value of the measurements was categorized into enlarged and stable groups using a threshold of 5% difference from the previous measurement as the threshold for aneurysm volume.\n\nImage acquisition\n\nA CT system (Aquilion ONE Global Standard, Canon Medical Systems) and an automatic contrast medium injector (Dual Shot GX7, Nemoto Kyorindo) were the single systems used in this study. The 4D-CT images were acquired with a nonhelical 22 phases scan (scan range: 160 mm) using a tube voltage of 100 kVp, total imaging time of 60 seconds, total CTDIvol of 70 mGy, and hybrid iterative reconstruction (FC15 of the standard reconstruction kernel for the abdomen, Adaptive Iterative Dose Reduction 3D: AIDR 3D enhanced).\n\nThe contrast medium injection route was employed with a 20G indwelling needle at the right midline vein. We performed the test bolus tracking method 37 to determine the imaging timing accurately. The test bolus (TB) and the main bolus (MB) were administered at the same injection rate. The contrast medium injection duration for TB was 3 seconds, followed by 5 seconds of saline, and for MB, 10 seconds of contrast medium followed by 5 seconds of saline. The interval between TB and MB was set to 15 seconds to ensure no interference between their TECs. The contrast medium dose was 240 mgI/kg of body weight.\n\nThe peak enhancement of the TEC formed by the aorta in the TB phase was used as a trigger. Imaging was performed 13 seconds after the trigger, assuming imaging before the contrast medium from the main bolus reached the aorta ( Fig 3 ).\n\nMeasurement method of TECs in clinical\n\nTECs in clinical were obtained from the raw images of 4D-CT performed for type diagnosis of endoleaks. All acquired phases of the 4D-CT were utilized for both endoleak-type diagnosis and TEC analysis. In this 4D-CT, the patent LA and IMA were identifiable. All patients included in this study involved a single feeding artery.\n\nThe measurement positions for TECs in clinical practice were as follows: For the EC, the position with the slowest contrast enhancement was selected. To minimize the impact of respiratory motion, the LA was measured near the vertebral column. The IMA and aorta were measured at the cross-sectional level, where respiratory fluctuations were least pronounced. The region of interest (ROI) size was adjusted appropriately to encompass areas with pixels having uniform CT numbers. All ROIs were obtained as short-axis images of the vessels ( Fig 4 ).\n\nAdditionally, the vertical axis of the TEC represented the enhancement number, which was calculated by subtracting the non-contrast CT number from the contrast-enhanced CT number. TEC analysis was performed using the average CT number within the ROI. The creation of the TEC was conducted with consensus between two radiological technologists.\n\nStatistical analysis\n\nPower analysis was conducted to determine the required sample size to detect a significant difference between the two groups. In a previous study by Nishihara et al, 30 which analyzed 10 patients, significant differences were observed in upslope (HU/sec), washout-slope (HU/sec), and 80% enhancement duration (seconds) between the two groups. Although the published study reported only medians and ranges, we estimated the means and standard deviations based on the raw data.\n\nFor the power analysis, we assumed an expected difference in means of approximately 10 and a standard deviation of roughly 10 for each parameter (upslope, washout-slope, 80% enhancement duration) based on our prior study’s dataset.\n\nA significance level of .05 (two-tailed test) and a power of 0.8 were assumed. The ratio of sample sizes between the two groups (stable group: enlarged group) was set to 3, based on reports indicating that 25% to 50% of persistent type II endoleaks result in aneurysm enlargement. 23 , 24 , 25 As a result, the required sample sizes were 11 for the enlarged group and 33 for the stable group.\n\nSubtype classification based on hemodynamic features was conducted using TEC in clinical to confirm the consistency of the simulated TEC. The hemodynamic subtype classification based on TEC in clinical practice was performed by visual assessment of the TEC shape through consensus between two radiologic technologists. Specifically, if the upslope and washout slope of the TEC in the aorta, feeder, and EC were all similar, it was classified as type II-1. If only the aorta and feeder showed similarity, it was classified as type II-2. If only the feeder and EC were similar, it was classified as type II-3. If none of these regions showed similarity, it was classified as type II-4. At the time of subtype classification, the presence or absence of aneurysm enlargement was blinded.\n\nWe set parameters of TEC in clinical such as arrival time of contrast medium, time of peak enhancement, time to peak enhancement, 80% enhancement duration (time maintaining 80% or more of the peak enhancement), upslope, washout slope, peak enhancement, the difference in time of peak enhancement between the aorta and EC (peak-to-peak time aorta ), and the difference in time of peak enhancement between the feeder and EC (peak-to-peak time feeder ) ( Fig 5 ). These parameters were obtained from TECs in the aorta, feeder, and EC in 4D-CT and compared between the enlarged and stable groups by the Mann-Whitney U test with a statistical significance level of less than 5%. Furthermore, Spearman’s correlation coefficient was employed to evaluate the relationship between the number of patent LAs, which showed significant differences in patient backgrounds, and each TEC parameter. Correlation coefficients were interpreted to identify potential associations, a statistical significance level of less than 5%.\n\nFor each parameter exhibiting particularly significant differences, the accuracy was analyzed by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves calculating the area under the curve (AUC), sensitivity, specificity, and cutoff values. All statistical analyses were conducted using the statistical software EZR version 1.68. 38\n\nResults\n\nSimulation of TEC\n\nThe TEC for the feeder varied with Q a − f , and the TEC for the EC fluctuated based on V E C and Q a − f . As the value in Q a − f increased, the upslope, washout slope, and iodine quantity in peak enhancement of both feeder and EC TECs increased. In contrast, the iodine quantity in the equilibrium phase remained unchanged ( Fig 6 ). As the value increased in V E C increased, the upslope, downslope, and iodine quantity in peak enhancement of the EC TEC decreased. In contrast, the iodine quantity in the equilibrium phase remained constant ( Fig 7 ). Through mathematical simulations using pharmacokinetic analysis, manipulating two factors, V E C and Q a − f , resulted in the classification of type II endoleaks into four subtypes based on their hemodynamic characteristics ( Fig 8 ).\n\nType Ⅱ-1: V E C is low, and Q a − f is high\n\nType Ⅱ-2: V E C is high, and Q a − f is high\n\nType Ⅱ-3: V E C is low, and Q a − f is low\n\nType Ⅱ-4: V E C is high, and Q a − f is low\n\nInter-observer error and threshold for aneurysm expansion\n\nRegarding follow-up protocols, the effect of the interval difference between 6 months and 1 year on aneurysm enlargement rate was insignificant in this study. The inter-observer error between the two measures was 0.14% (range, −1.24% to 0.53%). The 5% threshold for aneurysm expansion adopted in this study was sufficiently more significant than the observed inter-observer error. In addition, the rates of aneurysm expansion were 11.29% (range, 5.05%-33.15%) and −0.13% (range, −70.83% to 3.81%) in the enlarged and stable groups, respectively.\n\nHemodynamic subtype classification based on TECs\n\nClassification of hemodynamic subtypes using TECs obtained from 4D-CT revealed the following distribution: type II-1, 44.4% (20/45 patients); type II-2, 44.4% (20/45 patients); type II-3, 11.1% (5/45 patients); and type II-4, 0% (0/45 patients). All patients in the expanded group were type II-2 (14/14 patients), and 80.6% (25/31 patients) of patients in the stable group were type II-1 (20/31 patients) or II-3 (5/31 patients).\n\nComparison of TECs between the two groups\n\nThere were apparent differences in the TEC shapes for EC in the enlarged and stable groups and significant differences ( P < .001 ) in the time of peak enhancement, time to peak enhancement, 80% enhancement duration, upslope, washout slope, peak enhancement, peak-to-peak time aorta , and peak-to-peak time feeder . Furthermore, there was a significant difference in the arrival time of the contrast medium ( P = .04 ) ( Table Ⅱ ). For the enlarged group compared with the stable group, time of peak enhancement, time to peak enhancement, 80% enhancement duration, peak-to-peak time aorta , and peak-to-peak time feeder were increased. In contrast, upslope, washout slope, and peak contrast were decreased. In addition, differences in the number of patent LAs were observed between the two groups, with the enlarged group tending to have a higher number of patent LAs. When comparing arterial branch numbers with each TEC parameter, a weak correlation ( r = −0.296; P = .048) was observed between the number of patent LAs and the upslope of TEC. However, no significant correlation was found between the number of patent LAs and the other TEC parameters.\n\nComparison of predictive accuracy for aneurysm enlargement using TEC parameters\n\nThe association between each TEC parameter and aneurysm enlargement was found to be very high, with the following results: For the 80% enhancement duration, the AUC was 0.88 (sensitivity, 0.87; specificity, 0.80; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.779-0.990; cutoff, 16.9). For sensitivity for peak-to-peak timefeeder, the AUC was 0.78 (sensitivity, 0.93; specificity, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.621-0.937; cutoff, 13.0). For specificity for upslope, the AUC was 0.86 (sensitivity, 0.73; specificity, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.740-0.972; cutoff, 11.7). These results demonstrate the strong association of these parameters with aneurysm enlargement ( Table Ⅲ ).\n\nDiscussion\n\nThere is currently no clear guideline for managing persistent type II endoleaks, and decisions often rely on the preferences of both patients and vascular surgeons. Some evidence suggests that a subset of persistent type II endoleaks can lead to aneurysm enlargement and rupture, with reports indicating that 25% to 50% of persistent type II endoleaks result in enlargement. 23 , 24 , 25 , 39 In our study, 31% (14/45 patients) of type II endoleaks and persistent type II endoleaks demonstrated a tendency toward enlargement. Consequently, identifying risk factors that lead to aneurysm enlargement during regular surveillance is crucial for appropriate management.\n\nSarac et al 36 reported that smoking is associated with continued aneurysm growth, whereas Timaran et al 24 concluded that smoking is not a significant predictor of aneurysm enlargement. Similarly, no significant relationship between smoking and aneurysm enlargement was observed in this study. Regarding blood volume of the EC, Timaran et al 24 suggested an association with aneurysm enlargement, but no such correlation was observed in our study. The smaller blood volume of the EC observed here compared with that of Timaran et al may explain the lack of association. Additionally, Bargellini et al 40 also found no significant link between blood volume of the EC and aneurysm enlargement, and their results, like ours, indicated relatively small blood volume of the EC. These findings suggest that EC volume has limitations as a predictive factor, mainly when the volume is small, and its predictive capability may be restricted in such cases.\n\nMarchiori et al 41 proposed an association between the number of patent LAs and aneurysm enlargement, which aligns with our findings. We observed a weak correlation between the number of patent LAs and the TEC parameter upslope, with no significant correlations with other parameters. This suggests that TEC analysis may capture dynamic hemodynamic characteristics that traditional morphologic evaluations cannot. Although morphologic parameters such as EC volume and the number of patent LAs have a certain degree of predictive capability, their effectiveness is limited. Therefore, TEC analysis can serve as a valuable predictive factor, either as an alternative or combined with morphologic assessments.\n\nBargellini et al 40 examined the hemodynamic characteristics of persistent type II endoleaks using ultrasound, identifying longer washout times of the EC (≥520 seconds) as a key risk factor for aneurysm enlargement. Similarly, Demehri et al 23 found that persistent type II endoleaks detectable only in the delayed phase of contrast-enhanced CT scans were linked to an increased risk of aneurysm enlargement. These findings are consistent with the hemodynamic subtypes identified in our study, particularly type II-2 and type II-3, suggesting that TEC can provide valuable predictive insights into aneurysm behavior.\n\nAdditionally, Katahashi et al 39 used 4D-flow magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to differentiate between persistent and transient vessels, emphasizing the role of blood flow as a risk factor. Our findings suggest that type II-1 and type II-2 subtypes are likely to correspond to persistent vessels, whereas type II-3 is associated with stable or shrinking aneurysms. Unlike earlier reports focusing on isolated evaluations of EC or feeder/drainer dynamics, our comprehensive hemodynamic assessment offers a more nuanced understanding, distinguishing type II-2, associated with aneurysm enlargement, from type II-1 and type II-3, where the aneurysm remains stable or shrinks ( Fig 9 ). TEC parameters demonstrate significant potential for assessing aneurysm dynamics. Notably, the 80% enhancement duration, with a cutoff of 16.9 seconds, showed a sensitivity of 87% and specificity of 80%, indicating a balanced and reliable predictive capacity. These results are noteworthy when compared with those of previous studies. For example, Katahashi et al 39 reported that 4D-flow MRI achieved a sensitivity of 85.7% and specificity of 76.2% for predicting aneurysm sac enlargement, underlining its potential for early detection. Similarly, Bargellini et al 40 demonstrated that contrast-enhanced ultrasound achieved a specificity of 100% for identifying non-enlarging abdominal aortic aneurysms, although its sensitivity of 62.5% may limit its effectiveness in detecting all cases of aneurysm expansion.\n\nAlthough TEC measurements for feeders and the aorta may vary depending on ROI placement, small shifts in ROI position are unlikely to cause substantial TEC variations, given that contrast agent administration in 4D-CT is intravenous and imaging intervals are not closely spaced.\n\nHarms 42 reported the utility of time-intensity curve analysis using contrast-enhanced MRI for distinguishing malignant from benign lesions in breast cancer. Because time-intensity curve analysis can yield different results depending on ROI placement, it is recommended to use the pattern suggesting malignancy among multiple ROI placements. Similarly, type II-2, where contrast enhancement within the EC is gradual and prolonged, was associated with aneurysm enlargement in this study. When contrast enhancement is prolonged in this manner, blood flow stagnation within the EC is suggested. This stagnant flow likely results in prolonged retention of the contrast agent within the EC, leading to slower contrast washout and an extended enhancement duration. Specifically, in the enlarged group, the upslope of the TEC was significantly lower (7.1 vs 15 HU/second), the washout slope was reduced (2.4 vs 10 HU/second), and the 80% enhancement duration was longer (22.5 vs 8.2 seconds). These findings suggest that blood stagnation within the EC slows the contrast agent flow, causing a more gradual increase in contrast concentration and prolonged enhancement. Consequently, blood flow stagnation within the EC may directly contribute to these TEC parameter changes, reinforcing its association with aneurysm enlargement. Therefore, setting the ROI at the location within the EC where contrast delay occurs most prominently may help improve the limitations of ROI positioning, providing a more accurate assessment of hemodynamic characteristics.\n\nIn the simulation, parameter changes did not affect the equilibrium phase CT number. Because the equilibrium phase CT number depends on the administered contrast medium volume and extracellular fluid volume, it is unlikely to be influenced by blood flow. Additionally, because the blood volume of the EC is negligible compared with the overall extracellular fluid volume, minor changes in blood volume of the EC did not affect the equilibrium phase CT number.\n\nThis simulation objectively assesses how the TEC parameters for the feeder and EC change with variations in blood flow and blood volume of the EC. In other words, it demonstrates that TEC patterns fluctuate based on the extent of blood flow and blood volume of the EC.\n\nThe consistency of our simulation results with clinical data supports the validity of pharmacokinetic simulations. However, there was a discrepancy in the hemodynamic subtype classification between simulations (four subtypes) and clinical observations (three subtypes, with type II-4 not observed). Type II-4, characterized by a high blood volume of the EC but minimal inflow, may be challenging to visualize with 4D-CT due to low contrast sensitivity in low-dose, high-noise imaging conditions. Additionally, because the blood volume of the EC in the control group used in this study was small, type II-4, characterized by a large blood volume of the EC and low inflow rate, was not observed.\n\nIn clinical applications, hemodynamic subtype classification was visually assessed using TEC shapes. Although this approach provides practical utility, a more objective method using TEC parameters is desirable. Significant differences in TEC parameters between the enlarged and stable groups suggest that evaluating these parameters could help better understand the hemodynamic features of type II endoleaks.\n\nAccording to Laplace’s law, wall tension increases with a larger radius and more significant pressure differences ( Equation 1 ):\n\nP is pressure, R is radius, and T is wall tension; we denote the parameters for scenarios involving the EC with subscripts EC ( P E C , R E C , T E C ).\n\nTherefore, an increase in blood volume, which reflects an increase in EC diameter within the EC, may lead to higher wall tension within the EC. As a result, wall tension is likely higher in patients classified as type II-2, where the blood volume of the EC is relatively large compared with the inflow. Our observation that the hemodynamic subtype in the enlarged group was predominantly type II-2 (100%; 14/14 patients) supports this. Previous studies have reported a positive correlation between the volume or diameter of the EC and aneurysm enlargement. 23 , 24 However, analyses based solely on the absolute EC volume have limitations, and the relative balance between EC volume and inflow may be more relevant to aneurysm enlargement. The type II-2 classification, particularly, is characterized by a relatively high EC volume compared with inflow rather than just a high absolute EC volume. Therefore, even if the EC blood volume is relatively small, it can still be classified as type II-2 if the inflow is proportionally lower. This may explain why no direct correlation was observed between EC volume alone and aneurysm enlargement. Additionally, Dias et al 43 demonstrated that intra-sac pressure in the thrombus was lower in type II endoleaks associated with shrinking aneurysms than those that remained stable or enlarged. This underscores the complex interplay between EC pressure dynamics and aneurysm progression.\n\nLehmkuhl et al 28 highlighted the limitations of conventional two-phase CT protocols in accurately evaluating endoleaks and emphasized the utility of 4D-CT. In our study, analyzing TEC obtained from 4D-CT enables pre-emptive awareness of aneurysm enlargement during routine surveillance without requiring additional tests. Furthermore, if this method proves effective in predicting aneurysm enlargement, it could influence clinical processes by enabling earlier intervention with additional treatments and adjustments to follow-up intervals, particularly in large-scale studies.\n\nObservational limitations and recommendations\n\nThis study evaluates both persistent and non-persistent type II endoleaks, which may impact the interpretation of the findings. Additionally, being a retrospective, single-center study with limited sample size and short-term follow-up, the results should be interpreted cautiously. Therefore, larger-scale studies with extended follow-up periods are necessary to comprehensively evaluate aneurysm enlargement.\n\nPrevious studies, such as those by Müller-Wille et al, 25 emphasized the importance of complex IMA-LA type II endoleaks and the maximum diameters of feeders and drainers as solid indicators of aneurysm enlargement. However, our simulation model primarily focuses on pharmacokinetic and hemodynamic characteristics and does not assess vascular diameters. Furthermore, because this study only assessed type II endoleaks with a single feeder, hemodynamic characteristics might differ in patients with multiple feeders. Doppler and contrast-enhanced ultrasounds are particularly effective in detecting endoleaks, but Doppler ultrasound has a sensitivity of only 62% to 77% compared with contrast-enhanced CT, limiting its accuracy in clinical practice. As a result, contrast-enhanced CT is generally considered the standard for endoleak evaluation due to its higher sensitivity. 44 Contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) allows for the assessment of endoleak spread within the aneurysm sac, providing similar accuracy to contrast-enhanced CT, with a sensitivity of 94% and specificity of 93%. 45 Although CEUS can be an effective alternative in some patients, it is essential to note that, like Doppler ultrasound, CEUS is operator-dependent and may not be as widely available or standardized as contrast-enhanced CT. Conversely, 4D-CT, as used in this study, provides detailed temporal hemodynamic information and may serve as a valuable tool for future evaluations. However, concerns regarding increased radiation dose and contrast medium usage remain, particularly in elderly patients with EVAR. The use of contrast medium should be minimized whenever possible, particularly in EVAR patients, who are predominantly elderly. Contrast medium usage poses a risk of contrast-induced nephropathy, 46 which can lead to the development of acute kidney injury. Therefore, careful consideration is warranted regarding the use of contrast medium in this population. However, the average volume of contrast medium used in this study was less than 40 mL, significantly lower than that used in standard contrast protocols.\n\nThe TEC analysis used in this study requires capturing the enhancement curve from the arrival of the contrast medium in the aorta to its washout in the EC. Although the TBT method ensures reproducibility, changing imaging protocols might affect TEC reproducibility. In addition, our simulation model assumes constant blood volume and uses a fixed compartmentalization, which may only partially represent real-world hemodynamics. It is also noteworthy that our method cannot consider variations in cardiac output, which may influence arrival time of contrast medium, time of peak enhancement, and peak enhancement.\n\nMoreover, the subtype classification of type II endoleaks involves a subjective aspect, as it was determined based on TEC shape through consensus between two evaluators. Although apparent differences in TEC shapes and discrepancies between the two evaluators were minimal, the subjective nature of this classification should be acknowledged as a limitation.\n\nConclusions\n\nMathematical simulations using pharmacokinetic analysis revealed the hemodynamic characteristics of type II endoleaks. Type II endoleaks were classified into four subtypes based on the blood flow into the EC and the blood volume of the EC. Understanding the hemodynamics using TEC was shown to be a related to aneurysm diameter enlargement.\n\nFurthermore, 4D-CT is employed for type diagnosis of endoleaks, and when type II endoleaks are identified, the relationship between TEC and aneurysm diameter enlargement becomes possible without additional imaging. Prediction of aneurysm diameter enlargement using TECs could be valuable in deciding on additional treatments.\n\nAuthor contributions\n\nConception and design: KM, YN\n\nAnalysis and interpretation: KM, YN, NT\n\nData collection: KM, NT, MS\n\nWriting the article: KM, NT\n\nCritical revision of the article: KM, YN, NT, MS\n\nFinal approval of the article: KM, YN, NT, MS\n\nStatistical analysis: KM, NT\n\nObtained funding: Not applicable\n\nOverall responsibility: KM\n\nFunding\n\nNone.\n\nDisclosures\n\nNone.",
