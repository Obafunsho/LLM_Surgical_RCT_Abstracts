  "title": "A comparison of Trachway intubating stylet and Airway Scope for tracheal intubation by novice operators: A manikin study",
  "abstract": "The Trachway is a recently developed intubation device that resembles an illuminating stylet and incorporates a video‐assisted system. This study evaluated the use of this system for tracheal intubation by novice operators. This randomized cross‐over study compared the Trachway and the Airway Scope in simulated routine and difficult intubation scenarios. The difficult scenario was simulated by increasing the tongue volume of the manikin. The primary outcome measure in both airway scenarios was the time required for a successful tracheal intubation. For each scenario, the success rate, ease of intubation and operator preference were recorded for the two devices and compared. Average intubation time did not differ significantly between the Trachway and Airway Scope for the normal airway scenario (11.2 ± 6.5 vs. 9.8 ± 4.3 seconds, respectively; p = 0.07), but was significantly longer using the Trachway than with the Airway Scope on the difficult airway scenario (17.1 ± 11.1 vs. 9.5 ± 4.1 seconds, respectively; p < 0.001). The overall success rates of the Trachway and Airway Scope (96.3% and 98.6%, respectively) did not differ significantly ( p = 0.13). Preference for the Airway Scope was greater in both scenarios, and particularly in the difficult airway scenario ( p < 0.001). Although the devices are comparable in terms of ease of use and intubation time in normal scenarios, the ease of using the Airway Scope makes it more suitable for inexperienced operators in difficult intubation scenarios.",
