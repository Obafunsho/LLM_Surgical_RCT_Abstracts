  "title": "Open Randomized Multicenter Study to Evaluate Safety and Efficacy of Low Molecular Weight Sulfated Dextran in Islet Transplantation",
  "abstract": "Background: When transplanted human pancreatic islets are exposed to blood during intraportal infusion, an innate immune response is triggered. This instant blood-mediated inflammatory reaction (IBMIR) activates the coagulation and complement cascades and leads to the destruction of 25% of all transplanted islets within minutes, contributing to the need, in most patients, for islets from more than 1 donor. Low molecular dextran sulfate (LMW-DS) has been shown in experimental settings to inhibit IBMIR.\n\nMethods: The CIT-01 study was a phase II, multicenter, open label, active control, randomized study. Twenty-four subjects were randomized to peritransplant intraportal and systemic treatment with either LMW-DS or heparin, targeting an APTT of 150±10 and 50±5 seconds respectively. C-peptide response was measured with a mixed meal tolerance test at 75 and 365 days after transplant.\n\nResults: LMW-DS was safe and well tolerated with similar observed adverse events (mostly attributed to immunosuppression) as in the heparin arm. There was no difference in the primary endpoint (stimulated C-peptide 75±5 days after the first transplant) between the 2 arms (1.33±1.10 versus 1.56±1.36 ng/mL, p=0.66). Insulin requirement, metabolic parameters, Clarke and HYPO score, quality of life and safety were similar between the 2 treatments groups.\n\nConclusions: Even with low dosing, LMW-DS showed similar efficacy in preventing IBMIR to promote islet engraftment when compared to “state-of-the art” treatment with heparin. Furthermore, no substantial differences in the efficacy and safety endpoints were detected, providing important information for future studies with more optimal dosing of LMW-DS for the prevention of IBMIR in islet transplantation.",
