  "abstract": "Objectives: Percutaneous ablation of breast cancer has shown promise as a treatment alternative to open lumpectomy. We hypothesized that percutaneous removal of breast cancer followed by percutaneous ablation to sterilize and widen the margins would not only provide fresh naïve tissue for tumor marker and research investigation but better achieve negative margins post ablation.\n\nMethods: Patients diagnosed by percutaneous biopsy (ultrasound or stereotactic-guided) with breast cancer ≤1.5cm, >1cm from the skin and <5mm residual disease by MRI were accrued to this IRB-approved study. Patients were randomized to laser versus radiofrequency ablation (RFA). The US-guided ablation was performed in the OR and followed by immediate excision, whole mount pathology with PCNA staining and reconstruction.\n\nResults: 21 patients were accrued to the study. The laser arm (3 patients) pathology demonstrated unpredictability of the ablation zone and residual live tumor. Fifteen patients received RFA and all showed 100% ablation and negative margins. The mean pre-ablation estimated tumor size was O.7cm±0.2cm(range 0.3–1cm). MRI was helpful in ruling out multicentricity but less so in predicting presence or absence of residual disease. Seven of these patients showed no residual tumor and the other half showed residual dead tumor (O.5cm±0.7cm(range 0.1–2.5cm)) at the biopsy site with clear margins.\n\nConclusion: This pilot study represents the first report of the feasibility of the novel approach to minimally invasive therapy that is percutaneous excision and effectively cytoreduction followed by RFA of margins for the treatment of breast cancer.",
