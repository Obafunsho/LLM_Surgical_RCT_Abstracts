  "full_text": "Introduction\n\nPancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a malignant tumor associated with a very poor prognosis [ 1 ]. Surgery with adjuvant therapy remains the gold standard treatment for patients with PDAC [ 2 ]. However, over the last decades, neoadjuvant therapy (NAT) has been increasingly adopted as a treatment strategy, first for locally advanced and borderline resectable pancreatic cancer (LAPC and BRPC), but more recently also for resectable pancreatic cancer (RPC) [ 3 , 4 ]. There are multiple reasons for adopting NAT, including preventive treatment of micrometastases, higher R0 resection rates, better case selection for surgical resection, and better prognosis [ 5–7 ].\n\nSeveral chemotherapeutic regimens have been used over the years. Gemcitabine plus nab-paclitaxel (AG) and FOLFIRINOX are currently the two most commonly used regimens [ 8 ]. Due to the low tumor mutation burden (TMB) and the typical cold” tumor characteristics, immunotherapy is not a routine treatment option for PDAC, and the combination with neoadjuvant chemotherapy or chemoradiation and cancer vaccine has not demonstrated an encouraging clinical response [ 9 , 10 ]. Monotherapy with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI), such as PD-1 blockade, has not shown clinical benefit [ 11 , 12 ]. However, combining immunotherapy with radiotherapy seemed to improve outcomes significantly [ 13 ]. Our previous data showed that preoperative therapy with combined chemoradiotherapy and PD-1 inhibitor was potentially effective in patients with LAPC or BRPC, contributing to a superior objective response rate (ORR) and excellent R0 resection rates without serious adverse events or postoperative complications [ 14 ]. However, the impact of this multi-agent NAT regimen on pathological response (PR) and survival outcomes remains unknown.\n\nSeveral pathological factors have been reported to predict the outcome of PDAC resection, including node metastasis, residual margin (R1 resection), perineural and lymphovascular invasion, T-status, and grade [ 15 , 16 ]. The prognostic value of PR after NAT was clarified in other solid malignancies such as breast, rectal, and esophageal carcinoma, and a complete pathological response (CPR) was associated with a lower recurrence rate and improved survival [ 17–19 ].\n\nCPR is rare for PDAC after NAT and resection, ranging from 4% to 15%, which is lower than that in other solid cancers [ 20 ]. Furthermore, some studies have also observed prolonged survival in PDAC after achieving CPR compared to near complete or limited response [ 20–22 ]. As the mainstay of NAT is changing from chemotherapy to multi-modal therapy, few previous studies on CPR with a combination of different treatments (chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or immunotherapy) have reflected the current trend. In our previous study, CPR (20%) was more common in PDAC patients treated by PD-1 blockade plus chemoradiotherapy than in patients with LAPC or BRPC treated by neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (10%) [ 15 , 21 ].\n\nIn the past decades, several tumor response scoring (TRS) systems have been proposed for PDAC [ 23 ]. The Evans, College of American Pathologists (CAP) and MD Anderson Cancer Center (MDACC) appear to be the most widely used and studied [ 24 ]. The Evans and CAP systems are four-stage descriptive systems that are based on residual cancer about the regression of the tumor after NAT [ 25 , 26 ]. The MDACC system is a three-stage system based on the percentage of residual viable tumor cells in relation to the treated tumor bed [ 27 ]. All of these systems identify the areas where the tumor used to be and the number of viable tumor cells present. However, the preoperative predictive factors for PR after NAT and pancreatectomy for PDAC are not yet well established.\n\nThe present study aimed to identify the survival outcomes and PR of patients with PDAC who underwent surgical resection after preoperative therapy with PD-1 blockade plus chemoradiotherapy, meanwhile, the preoperative predictive factors for PR and survival were also evaluated.\n\nMethods\n\nStudy design and patient selection\n\nA retrospective and single-institutional cohort study of patients with PDAC was undertaken using the prospectively maintained pancreatic database at the Department of Pancreatic and Metabolic Surgery, Nanjing Drum Tower Hospital, Affiliated Hospital of Medical School, Nanjing University, China. Of note, some data on the initial 29 patients of this database have been previously reported [ 14 ]. Continuous patients with PDAC who underwent surgical resection after NAT from April 2019 to December 2023 were enrolled in this study. A flowchart of patient enrollment is shown in Figure 1 . Finally, 26 patients received neoadjuvant PD-1 blockade plus chemoradiotherapy (combined group), and the other patients received neoadjuvant PD-1 blockade plus chemotherapy (non-combined group). The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Nanjing Drum Tower Hospital (No. 2024-247-01). All procedures were in accordance with the Helsinki Declaration and informed consent forms were signed by patients and their families.\n\nPatient data collection\n\nThe clinical data of patients, including age, sex, NLR (neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio) before operation, carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA19-9) levels before NAT/operation, tumor size before NAT/operation, and the resectability status which was classified into RPC, BRPC, and LAPC according to the NCCN guidelines were collected [ 28 ]. The CA19-9 decrease was defined using the following formula: [pre-NAT CA19-9 (U/mL) – pre-operation CA19-9 (U/ml)]/[pre-NAT CA19-9 (U/mL)] × 100 (%). Tumor size was measured in the maximal axial dimension by a triple-phase contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) scan ( Figure 2 ). The tumor size decrease and the NLR decrease were defined using the formula as the CA19-9.\n\nNeoadjuvant and adjuvant treatment\n\nNAT was performed as described and detailed previously [ 14 ]. Briefly, patients received two treatment cycles of PD-1 inhibitor plus chemotherapy first (AG: Nab-paclitaxel 125 mg/m 2 and gemcitabine 1000 mg/m 2 on day 1 and day 8; PD-1 inhibitor: Tislelizumab 200 mg on day 1). Then an imaging examination was performed to assess the prognosis, and patients without disease progression received SBRT with SIB (high dose field: 50 Gy/10 fractions; the remainder: 30 Gy/10 fractions) during the third cycle in the combined group, while patients in the non-combined group directly received another two treatment cycles of PD-1 inhibitor plus chemotherapy. On completion of four cycles of NAT, multiple disciplinary teams (MDT) would reassess the surgical possibility for resection, including imaging checkups, positron emission computed tomography (PET-CT), changes in tumor markers, and the health status of patients. Patients whose CA19-9 was stable or decreased and radiographic findings didn’t demonstrate clear progression, or the standardized uptake value (SUV) max parameter of the lesion decreased in PET-CT, were eligible for resection [ 29 ]. Adjuvant therapy including a combination of tislelizumab and AG was administered in at most four cycles after resection according to the patient’s physical condition ( Figure 3 ).\n\nSurgical procedures\n\nThe operation was performed by the same team of surgeons. After ruling out distant metastasis by laparoscopic exploration, patients underwent pancreatectomy, lymphadenectomy, and peripheral pancreatic nerve dissection. Vascular resection or reconstruction was performed according to the invasion circumstance in operation. The details of the operation including operation time, operation type, vascular resection type, and blood transfusion were collected.\n\nPathological assessments\n\nTumor characteristics included initial tumor size (mm), tumor location (head or body/tail), and TNM stage based on the American Joint Committee on Cancer manual (8 th edition) were collected. Tumor response to NAT was assessed using the Evans, CAP, and MDACC systems, by the two individual pathologists blinded to the clinical outcome. CPR was defined as an absence of residual tumor in the resected tissue ( Figure 4 ).\n\nOutcomes and follow-up\n\nAll postoperative complications were recorded and graded according to the Clavien-Dindo classification [ 30 ]. Clavien grade III or greater were considered severe morbidity. R0 was defined as a distance of at least 1 mm. Overall survival (OS) was calculated from the date of surgery to the date of death or the last date of follow-up. Disease-free survival (DFS) was defined as the time from the date of resection to the date of tumor relapse confirmed radiologically. The deadline for follow-up was 30 June, 2024.\n\nStatistical analysis\n\nContinuous variables were presented as mean ± SD or median (interquartile range (IQR)) and categorical variables were summarized as numbers (percentage). Multivariable analyses for tumor response were calculated with a logistic regression model. Survival analyses were carried out with the Kaplan-Meier method, using the Log-rank test for the difference of curve pairs. To assess the independent factors on survival, univariable and multivariable Cox Proportional Hazard regression model analyses were performed. Variables with a p value < 0.10 in univariable analyses were included in multivariable analyses. Data were analyzed using IBM SPSS, v.25 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY) and graphs were prepared using PRISM 8 (GraphPad Software, Inc., La Jolla, CA). A p value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.\n\nResults\n\nBaseline characteristics\n\nA total of 47 patients were included in the study, including 31 males and 16 females. The mean age was 61.2 ± 8.0 years. 7 patients were RPC, 16 patients were BRPC and 24 patients were LAPC. 23 patients (88.5%) in the combined group and 18 patients (85.7%) in the non-combined group achieved R0 resection. In total, 27 patients (57.4%) received vascular resection, the rate of severe morbidity was 21.3%, and 3 patients died within 90 days after surgery ( Table 1 ).\n\nPathological response\n\nIn the combined group, 6 patients (23.1%) achieved CPR; however, there was no CPR in the non-combined group ( Table 2 ). In the multivariable analysis, age (HR: 1.149; 95% CI, 1.018–1.297; p = 0.024) (HR: 1.166; 95% CI, 1.028–1.322; p = 0.017) and tumor size decrease (HR: 0.012; 95% CI, 0.000–0.697; p = 0.033) (HR: 0.009; 95% CI, 0.000–0.468; p = 0.019) were confirmed to be independently associated with PR assessed by the CAP and MDACC system respectively ( Tables 3 and 4 ). However, no factors were found to be independently associated with PR assessed by the Evans system.\n\nSurvival outcome\n\nFinally, 44 patients were included in the survival analysis, as three patients died within 90 days after the operation. The 2-year OS rate was 54.7%, the median DFS was 22.0 months and the median OS was 25.2 months for all patients. In the combined group, the 2-year OS rate was 75.2% and the median OS was 30.5 months which were better than those in the non-combined group (42.6% and 23.3 months), while the difference was not significant ( p = 0.253 and p = 0.473). The median DFS were 23.2 and 16.8 months in the combined group and non-combined group respectively, the difference was also not significant ( p = 0.674, Figure 5 ).\n\nIn the multivariable analysis, portal vein (PV)/superior mesenteric vein (SMV) invasion (HR: 3.713; 95% CI, 1.101–12.528; p = 0.034), resectability status of LAPC (HR: 4.433; 95% CI, 1.277–15.391; p = 0.019) and preoperative CA19-9 levels (HR: 1.004; 95% CI, 1.002–1.007; p = 0.002) were all significant prognostic factors for OS ( Table 5 ). Preoperative CA19-9 levels (HR: 1.005; 95% CI, 1.002–1.008; p = 0.001) were an independent prognostic factor for DFS ( Table 6 ).\n\nDiscussion\n\nIn the present study, we found that PD-1 blockade plus chemoradiotherapy was associated with a higher CPR in PDAC patients who underwent radical surgery after NAT. For these patients, age and tumor size decrease were predictive factors for PR assessed by the CAP and MDACC systems. In the survival analysis, PD-1 blockade plus chemoradiotherapy may also improve the OS and DFS, PV/SMV invasion, resectability status of LAPC, and preoperative CA 19-9 levels were independent prognostic factors for survival.\n\nFor PDAC patients, advances in multimodal therapy (neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy) have contributed to improvements in survival outcomes over the past several decades [ 31 ]. The use of NAT provides a means of downstaging LAPC or BRPC, allowing for a potential route to surgical resection, and has been shown to lead to a survival of almost 3 years in appropriately selected patients [ 32 , 33 ]. Additionally, some tumors have even been reported to demonstrate CPR upon pathological assessment of resected specimens following NAT, which is reported to be significantly associated with improved survival [ 22 , 24 ]. However, a favorable CPR rate after NAT for PDAC is not a frequent event, even with the improvement of new chemotherapeutic regimens (FOLFIRINOX or gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel). The first case of CPR following NAT and surgical resection in LAPC was reported in 2007 [ 34 ].\n\nSince then, some case reports and other series with CPR have been reported. In a study including 186 LAPC/BRPC patients who received neoadjuvant chemoradiation and subsequent pancreatectomy, only 19 patients (10%) had CPR [ 21 ]. Another one-hundred-patient series with BRPC/LAPC reported a CPR rate of 14.5% when treated with neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy followed by surgery [ 35 ]. As reported in a phase 2 clinical trial, preoperative chemoradiotherapy was associated with improved treatment response, compared with chemotherapy in patients with LAPC or BRPC [ 33 ]. The combination of radiotherapy and ICI can also result in near CPR in a patient with LAPC, which may be due to the fact that radiotherapy or chemotherapy can upregulate PD-L1 expression [ 36 , 37 ]. However, the effect of preoperative chemoradiotherapy combined with ICI on PR has not been reported. In our study, we found that NAT with PD-1 blockade plus chemoradiotherapy can achieve a CPR rate of 23.1%, which is the highest to our knowledge. Further study to investigate the clinical significance of this multimodal therapy in a larger cohort is warranted.\n\nIn terms of the safety of surgery after NAT, it’s indicated that patients receiving preoperative chemotherapy and radiotherapy did not show significant differences in surgical complications or mortality compared to those undergoing immediate surgery in a multicenter randomized clinical trial. Furthermore, the rate of POPF reduced in patients with preoperative chemoradiotherapy [ 38 ]. In our study, the rate of severe morbidity and 90-day mortality was 21.3% and 6.4% respectively, with an R0 rate of 87.2%, which indicated that a high R0 rate can be achieved safely in the surgery after NAT.\n\nThe CAP, MDACC, and Evans systems were most widely used to reflect PR and predict survival in patients with NAT, whereas the CAP and MDACC systems had the best methodological quality [ 21 ]. However, there were few studies to investigate the predictive factors for those scoring systems in patients with PDAC after NAT. In the study, we found that age and tumor size decrease were independent factors for CAP and MDACC systems. However, no factors were identified for the Evans system. Some efforts were also made to demonstrate that reduction in tumor volume, young age, low post-treatment CA19-9 level, and use of gemcitabine as a radiosensitizer were confirmed to be independently associated with pathological major response, which was partially consistent with our results [ 39 , 40 ]. This could be extremely useful in identifying post-NAT factors to predict the PR, allowing a better selection of PDAC patients to undergo surgery after NAT.\n\nIn the survival analysis of the present study, we found that preoperative therapy with PD-1 blockade plus chemoradiotherapy may improve survival with the 2-year OS rate of 75.2%, the median OS of 30.5 months and the median DFS of 23.2 months, albeit with no significant difference than one or two agents of the multiagent regimens. One of the reasons may be the small sample size and retrospective nature of this study; we believe that a significant survival benefit of this multimodal therapy can be observed in a larger prospective study.\n\nAs the pancreatectomy after NAT was usually aggressive, careful patient selection was extremely required to exclude those who were incapable of obtaining benefits from surgery. However, most studies on surgery after NAT have focused on safety, and there have been few studies on the preoperative factors predicting survival. In addition, both anatomical and biological (CA19-9 level) factors should be considered for the prognosis of PDAC [ 41 ]. In the present study, we found that PV/SMV invasion, resectability status of LAPC, and CA19-9 levels before operation were independent prognostic factors for OS, and the preoperative CA19-9 levels was a predictor of DFS. PV/SMV invasion is not included in the pathological staging of PDAC, however, the results of a study including more than 450 non-metastatic PDAC patients showed that radiographic PV/SMV invasion was correlated with a poor prognosis [ 42 ]. In a recent study, PV/SMV infiltration and resection were also presented as a poor prognostic marker [ 43 ]. These results may be explained as that PV/SMV invasion may lead to hematogenous tumor spread and PDAC infiltrating the PV/SMV is more aggressive. CA19-9 was another important prognostic factor for survival after surgery following NAT in our study. As a glycoprotein antigen, CA19-9 has been reported as a prognostic marker in some studies of PDAC following NAT. CA19-9 was included in the pancreatic neoadjuvant Massachusetts-score (PANAMA-score), which was proven to improve the prediction of postresection survival after NAT in PDAC [ 44 ]. CA19-9 normalization after NAT was associated with a higher 3-year OS rate than elevated CA19-9 value and only radiologic response (a complete or partial response), these results were consistent with those of another study which showed that following NAT, normalization of CA19-9, rather than the magnitude of change, was the strongest prognostic marker for long-term survival [ 44 , 45 ]. In the study, we first identify the effect of resectability status on the survival of surgical patients after NAT. We found that LAPC patients have worse OS than RPC/BRPC patients, which may be due to that R0 is more difficult to be achieved in patients with LAPC. The result may indicate that surgery after NAT should be more carefully selected in LAPC.\n\nThis study has several important limitations. First, it was a retrospective cohort study and the potential for selection bias may be included. Second, this is a single institution-based study with a small sample size and the follow-up time is relatively short. In addition, we did not capture regimen toxicity and adverse events, although some of these results have been reported in our previous study. The results are exploratory and further research is necessary to verify and authenticate our discoveries, necessitating larger-scale clinical trials.\n\nConclusions\n\nIn conclusion, NAT with PD-1 blockade plus chemoradiotherapy was associated with a higher CPR rate in PDAC patients and may also improve survival after surgery. Age and tumor size decrease were predictive factors for PR assessed by the CAP and MDACC system. PV/SMV invasion, resectability status of LAPC, and preoperative CA 19-9 levels were independent prognostic factors for survival.",
