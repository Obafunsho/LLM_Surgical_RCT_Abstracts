  "full_text": "INTRODUCTION\n\nSince the first coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery over 5 decades ago, reducing\nperioperative adverse events and improving graft patency have obsessed surgeons.\n\nTransit-time flow measurement (TTFM) [ 1 ] is a\nrecently revived technology that allows easy assessment of graft flow (GF) and immediate\nrevision of the graft where the results are not optimal. According to the 2018\nrecommendations of the European Society of Cardiology/and the European Society of\nCardiothoracic Surgery, Doppler control of coronary bypass surgery is recommended. However,\nthis recommendation does not obtain more than IIa-B rank for the lack of solid scientific\nevidence [ 2 ].\n\nPublished data on these techniques are generally limited to small number of cases and not\ncomparative; therefore, their applicability to a larger cohort of patients is not\nimmediately apparent.\n\nFurthermore, data are still controversial: while some authors have shown a positive effect\nof TTFM on early and mid-term results after coronary revascularization [ 3 , 4 ], other studies [ 5 , 6 ] failed to demonstrate any impact of this\nmeasurement on CABG outcomes. To overcome this limitation, we set up a comparative\nretrospective study of patients undergoing primary isolated CABG to determine the clinical\nimpact of TTFM on early postoperative outcomes, by the ability of TTFM to detect technical\nerrors in coronary artery anastomoses, and the incidence of this problem.\n\nPATIENTS AND METHODS\n\nEthic statement\n\nAn Institutional Review Board grant was released by the ethical committee of the French\nSociety of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery (EPICARD):\nDELIBERE_CERC-SFCTCV-2021-12_num32_LAALI arterial coronary revascularization.\n\nStudy population\n\nA single-centre retrospective analysis involved 945 patients undergoing isolated total\narterial CABG with internal thoracic arteries (ITAs) at our institution, between January\n2017 and February 2020. Preoperative patient’s data and outcomes were prospectively\ncollected in the EPICARD database. EPICARD database was accessed for patient data\nextraction in March 2020. Thirty-five patients, with high-risk preoperative status\naccording to the EuroSCORE II definition or redo procedures, were excluded from the\nanalysis.\n\nOn-pump complete arterial revascularization with bilateral ITAs with a Y-configuration,\nor single ITA in case of isolated left anterior descending artery disease, was planned for\nall patients. All ITAs were skeletonized. Anastomosis was done with 8–0 polypropylene\n(Prolene; Ethicon, Somerville, NJ, USA) sutures.\n\nDepending on the surgeon's preference, TTFMs were evaluated in 430 patients (TTFM group),\nor not evaluated in 480 patients (no TTFM group). An institutional prospective digital\ndatabase system (DxCare, Medasys Corporation) was also used as complementary data\nsource.\n\nDefinitions and outcomes\n\nIn this study, the primary end point was the occurrence of in-hospital major cardiac\nadverse events (MACE), including in-hospital mortality, perioperative myocardial\ninfarction, cardiac arrest, need for intra-aortic balloon pump or extra-corporeal membrane\noxygenation support and the need for urgent postoperative coronary angiogram and\npostoperative percutaneous or surgical revascularization. The diagnosis of perioperative\nmyocardial infarction was made on the basis of clinical symptoms and additional cardiac\nbiomarkers with or without abnormal EKG. No follow-up was available for outcomes\nanalysis.\n\nAll clinical events were recorded.\n\nTransit-time flow measurement assessment\n\nIn the TTFM group, the measurements was performed with the MiraQ or VeriQ C devices\n(Medistim ASA, Surgitech, France), after cross-clamp release, on partial cardiopulmonary\nbypass (CPB) ( Video 1 ).\n\nThe systolic blood pressure at the time of the measurements was at least 100 mmHg.\n\nMeasurements were done in the middle portions for ITA grafts. The measurements were taken\nafter all grafts were completed; the 2- or 3-mm probe was most commonly used. We do the\nmeasurements in 2 steps for sequential anastomosis: in the first step, we put the probe\nbefore sequential anastomosis while putting a vascular clamp after sequential anastomosis;\nby this way, we control the quality of anastomosis. In the second step, to verify the\ncompetitive flow, we do the measurement without clamping the distal anastomosis.\n\nManipulation of grafts during measurement must be very careful to avoid any inadvertent\ntraction on the grafts and anastomotic tears. To standardize [ 7 ] and optimize the evaluation of the TTFM, we collected the\nmeasurements that were carried out respecting the following instructions, the acoustic\ncoupling index must be above 40% (green or yellow), indicating the accuracy of the\nultrasonic conductivity; and the flow measurement was collected when mean flow indicated\nby the red line was constant and horizontal ( Fig.\n1a ).\n\nThe patency of the grafts was assessed using 3 variables: diastolic flow (DF) curve, mean\nflow and pulsatility index (PI). Normally, the flow curve will show a small backflow\nduring early systole and a predominantly forward flow during diastole [ 1 ].\n\nMean flow should be cautiously interpreted, as its value is not necessarily a good\nindicator of the quality of the anastomosis. Mean flow is largely dependent on the quality\nof the native coronary artery, and low mean flow can be expected in fully patent\nanastomoses whenever the target territory has a poor runoff. We considered mean flows of\n<15 ml/min to be questionable [ 8 ].\n\nThe PI is a good indicator of the flow pattern and, consequently, of the quality of the\nanastomosis. This number is obtained by dividing the difference between the maximum and\nminimum flows by the value of the mean flow. The PI value should ideally be between 1 and\n5. The possibility of a technical error in the anastomosis increases for higher PI values\n[ 9 ].\n\nBy definitions surgical revision means revision of the distal anastomosis or revision of\nthe graft conduit due to abnormal TTFM results ( Fig.\n1b ).\n\nThreshold values of TTFM assessment were mean GF >15 ml/min, PI <5 and DF >70%\nfor left coronary bed and >50% for the right one [ 7 ].\n\nStatistical analyses\n\nComparison between the TTFM and non-TTFM groups and univariable analysis for the\nassessment of potential prognostic factors of MACE occurrence were performed using\nChi 2 and Fisher’s exact tests for categorical variables and Welch t -test for quantitative ones. A propensity analysis was performed to\ncontrol for selection bias. An inverse probability weighting (IPW) approach was performed\nto reduce potential differences between the TTFM and non-TTFM sub-cohorts in baseline\ncharacteristics. The propensity score was obtained with a multivariable non-parsimonious\nlogistic regression model estimating, for each patient, the probability to receive a TTFM\nassessment using the preoperative features. The preoperative features used to model the\npropensity score were: sex, age, body mass index, creatinin clearance (ml/min), chronic\ndialysis, diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cerebrovascular arteriopathy,\nneuromuscular impairment, peripheral artery disease, previous or planned abdominal aortic\noperation, extracardiac arteriopathy, NYHA class, CCS IV angina, recent MI (<90 days),\nLVEF (%), pulmonary artery pressure, urgency status, left main coronary artery stenosis\n>50%, previous percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty, hypertension,\ndyslipidaemia, vitamin K antagonists treatment, platelet antiaggregant treatment, double\nplatelet antiaggregant treatment and number of arterial conduits. All variables included\nin the propensity score model reflected knowledge available at baseline. Standardized\ndifferences were examined to assess balance provided by the obtained propensity score\nweighting, with a threshold of 10% designated to indicate clinically meaningful imbalance\n(forestplot). In the primary analysis, the propensity score was used in the modelling of\nMACE occurrence by TTFM assessment through an IPW approach. A first sensitivity analysis\nwas conducted to assess the robustness of the findings using the propensity score as an\nadjustment variable in a multivariable regression explaining MACE by TTFM. In a second set\nof sensitivity analyses, variables significantly associated to MACE in univariable\nanalyses were additionally added to the adjustment model: CPB time (a clinically relevant\nrisk factor) and EuroSCORE II (a composite score containing the other significant\nvariables).\n\nData are expressed as median [Q1; Q3] for continuous variables, and percentages for\nqualitative variables. All P -values were two-tailed.\n\nDescriptive statistical analyses were carried out on the site https://www.pvalue.io (Medistica.,\npvalue.io, a graphic user interface to the R statistical analysis software for scientific\nmedical publications., 2020). R software 4.0.3 was used for univariable and multivariable\nlogistic regressions.\n\nData availability statement\n\nThe data underlying this article will be shared on reasonable request to the\ncorresponding author.\n\nRESULTS\n\nPreoperative characteristics are summarized in Table 1 . Operative data and postoperative outcomes were collected as found in Table 2 . The CPB times were longer in the\nTTFM group because of the supplementary time needed for measurement (76.0 min [62.0; 91.2]\nvs 79.0 min [65.0; 94.0], P = 0.042).\n\nSix (1.4%) patients in the TTFM group vs no patients in the No TTFM group underwent\nintraoperative graft revision because of unsatisfying flow values, P =\n0.011: left ITA to left anterior descending artery in 3 patients, right ITA to posterior\ndescending artery in 2 patients and right ITA to obtuse marginal artery in 1 patient. No\nelectrocardiographic changes were noted in those patients in whom unsatisfactory GF was\nnoticed and the anastomosis had to be corrected. In all cases, the anastomotic problem were\ncorrected at the time of surgery, resulting in satisfactory flows. There were no kinked or\ntwisted conduits. Postoperative course of all these patients was uneventful. The mean GF, PI\nand DF values of these patients before and after revision were not available for\nanalysis.\n\nMACE were significantly lower in the TTFM group (14, 3.3%) than in the no TTFM group (33,\n6.9%, P = 0.014). Twelve (2.5%) patients in the no TTFM group vs 7 (1.6%, P = 0.36) in the TTFM group underwent unplanned postoperative coronary\nangiogram. Details of coronary angiograms results are resumed in Table 3 . TTFM values were available for 4/6 patients with abnormal\ncoronary angiograms: mean GF, PI, and DF were 33 ml/min, 3, and 69%. Eight patients in the\nno TTFM group and 4 patients in the TTFM group underwent urgent immediate postoperative\nrevascularization; details of revascularization modalities were summarized in the same\ntable. The remaining patients (3 patients in the no TTFM group and 2 patients in the TTFM\ngroup) were medically treated.\n\nCardiac-related mortality was 1.9% (9 patients) in the no TTFM group vs 0.7% (3 patients, P = 0.12) in the TTFM group. Non-cardiac causes of death in the no TTFM\ngroup were septic shock (3), hypoxic arrest (2) and cerebro-vascular accident (1).\nNon-cardiac causes of death in the TTFM group were cerebro-vascular accident (3) and\nmesenteric ischaemia in 1 patient.\n\nDetails of construction of propensity score and univariable and multivariable regressions\nare available as Supplementary\nMaterial .\n\nAt crude regression, TTFM was protective against MACE occurrence (odds ratios 0.46, 95%\nconfidence interval 0.23–0.85, P = 0.016). IPW adjustment did not\nsignificantly displace P- values and odds ratios for MACE occurrence in the\nTTFM group 0.44, 95% confidence interval 0.28–0.69, P < 0.001.\nMultivariable regressions are resumed in Table\n4 .\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nTTFM gives important and accurate intraoperative information about the status and patency\nof each individual graft. It enables technical problems such as kinked, twisted or stenotic\ngrafts to be diagnosed accurately, thereby allowing prompt revision of the constructed\ngrafts before the patient leaves the operating room [ 10 ]. Thus, haemodynamic instability during the early postoperative period, which\ncould be catastrophic, is possibly prevented, and the probability of early graft failure is\nminimized significantly, improving the outcome of CABG surgery.\n\nHowever, its usefulness during a CABG is not yet unanimous; in one hand, some surgeons\nargue against the use of TTFM, saying that TTFM is difficult to use and is time-consuming.\nThat might be right in the beginning, but the learning curve is very short and requires no\nmore than 30 s per measurement [ 11 ].\n\nIn addition, some believe that TTFM is unnecessary, arguing that incidences of surgical\nmistakes are extremely low, and the high cost of the equipment causing surgeons’ and\nhospitals’ hesitation in adopting TTFM technology.\n\nOn the other hand, even if the threshold values and curves were defined for different types\nof grafts and revascularized vessels [ 12 ],\nstandardization of TTFM findings is difficult because of large biologic variability among\ndifferent patients, as well as within the same patient. Interpretation of flow curves and\nTTFM findings is largely dependent on the surgeon’s personal experience.\n\nThe ability to correctly interpret TTFM findings develops with clinical and experimental\nexperience and, thus, surgeons who have not been exposed to TTFM technology cannot easily\naccord it the proper level of importance.\n\nFinally, manipulation of grafts during measurement, which must be very careful in order to\navoid any inadvertent traction on the grafts and anastomotic tears, is another reason that\nrestraint the surgeons.\n\nAs stated in the Patients and Methods section, in the TTFM group, the measurements were\nperformed after cross-clamp release, on partial CPB.\n\nSince coronary bypass strategy in our centre is all-arterial with 2 ITAs, we changed our\nstrategy of TTFM measurement: instead of testing on-pump after clamp release, now we do the\nmeasurement for each anastomosis when we are still under clamping, to facilitate both\ntechnical factors and difficulties for interpretation of the data. Measurements during\n‘cross-clamp on’ can help us easily check the quality of anastomosis specially based on the\nPI value. This new practice has made most surgeons more confident.\n\nOf course, the measurements should be done again after cross-clamp release, and even more\nafter weaning the CPB, to ensure that the lengths of the grafts and the geometry of the\nsequential anastomosis are correct, and to give us information about competitive flow [ 13 ]. Nevertheless, sometimes it could be very\ndifficult to expose anastomoses on lateral or inferior wall after coming off pump,\nespecially with multiple sequential arterial grafts. In such cases, we rely upon TTFM only\nassessed while on partial CPB.\n\nOccurrence of MACE in contemporary coronary surgery is rare, ranging between 2% and 7%\npostoperatively [ 5 , 12 ] and 12% at 5 years [ 14 ]. In our series, the overall occurrence of MACE was 5%.\n\nIn comparative studies, Becit et al. [ 4 ] and Bauer et al. [ 15 ] reported significant improvement of short-term clinical\noperative outcomes using TTFM. Recently, a large meta-analysis [ 10 ] showed that TTFM improves CABG procedures; this evidence was\nsupported by the REQUEST study [ 12 ], a large\nprospective multicentre study that investigated surgical procedure changes guided by TTFM\nand ultrasonic imaging of aorta, conduits and grafts. On the other hand, the GRIIP RCT trial\n[ 5 ] and a recent sub-analysis of ROOBY trial\n[ 6 ] failed to demonstrate any impact of TTFM\non 1 and 5-years clinical outcomes. Actually, graft assessment in the GRIIP trial involved\nTTFM in association with intraoperative angiography, resulting in a more difficult\ninterpretation of the unique effect of TTFM on postoperative results. In the ROOBY trial\nsub-analysis, TTFM was associated with a significant improvement of graft patency (83% vs\n78%, P < 0.01) and fewer occluded grafts (29%, vs 38%, P = 0.01).\n\nIn our series, thanks to adoption of TTFM, MACE occurrence was significantly reduced by\nhalf, dropping from 6.9% to 3.3%. Moreover, every adverse event was reduced, even without\nreaching statistical significance. Our hypothesis is that intraoperative graft revision in\nthe TTTFM group may have positively affected the outcomes; a technical issue on conduit or\ngraft anastomosis may be more dramatic in multiple sequential arterial coronary surgery,\nsince blood perfusion of a large amount of myocardial wall often relies upon the flow in a\nsingle conduit.\n\nAdverse cardiac events in TTFM patients could be explained because even if the threshold\nvalues and curves were defined for different types of grafts and revascularized vessels,\nstandardization of TTFM findings is difficult because of large biologic variability among\ndifferent patients, as well as within the same patient. Moreover, delayed occlusion of\ngrafts or anastomosis, for example because of left ITA intimal tears leading in later\nthrombosis. As advocated by Di Giammarco et al. [ 16 ], addition of high-resolution epicardial ultrasonography could\nincrease the accuracy of TTFM assessment.\n\nThe ability to correctly interpret TTFM findings develops with clinical and experimental\nexperience, and we believe that, even with these limitations, by using more and more this\ndevice, we can prevent a large number of unpleasant events. On the other hand, we have to\nkeep in mind that TTFM values are only useful and do not dictate the decision. Even if TTFM\nvalues could suggest the revision of the anastomosis, surgeon's experience will always have\nthe last word.\n\nLimitations\n\nThere are some limitations in this present study. As stated in the methods section, this\nstudy carries all the limits that a retrospective design implies, even if all data were\nprospectively collected into the database of EPICARD. Unfortunately, mean GF, PI and DF\nvalues were not available for the whole study population, as well as for patients\nundergoing anastomosis revision because of unsatisfying TTFM values. When we talk about\nthe surgeon's preference, it means that when our centre was equipped with this device in\n2015, half of the surgeons was just not convinced of the usefulness of this device, and\nthey never used that. Even if we think that there is not any indication bias in this\nstudy, we agree that a bias by indication cannot be ruled out, also because of the\nnon-randomized design of the study. Now, after presenting the results in our centre, all\nthe surgeons adopted the TTFM for graft evaluation and randomized study is no longer\npossible in our centre. Comparison between the no TTFM and TTFM patients included a\npropensity score analysis, to control for selection bias. Once the propensity model is\nconstructed and a propensity score is calculated for each patient, 3 common types of\ncomparison are employed: matching, stratification and multivariable adjustment [ 17 ]. Among common types of comparison suggested\n[ 17 ], we used the propensity score as\nmultivariable adjustment with a IPW approach [ 18 , 19 ]; this was the sole mean\nof adjusting because of the small number of events, since no patients needed to be\nexcluded from the analysis.\n\nFurther randomized studies have been advocated [ 6 ], but, in our opinion, nowadays, randomization is no more ethically possible\nand even desirable. First, quality control assessment of anastomoses is recommended by\nrecent ESC guidelines [ 2 ]. Furthermore,\nsurgical teams confident with TTFM have a daily proof of usefulness of the technique and\nits advantages for all coronary patients. Such surgeons, just like us, will be very\nreluctant to abandon a tool that allows reduction of adverse events in their patients.\n\nTherefore, we believe that as the push towards better patient care becomes increasingly\nimportant, the use of TTFM during CABG will become imperative. So, large comparative\nstudies like ours could be very helpful.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nIn this series, intraoperative GF measurement with TTFM was associated with a reduction of\nMACE occurrence. According to our experience, 3 stages of TTFM measurement provide valuable\nconfidence in anastomotic patency during CABG, and it should be recommended for graft\nevaluation in arterial CABG surgery.",
