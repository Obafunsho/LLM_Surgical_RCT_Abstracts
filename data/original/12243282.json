  "abstract": "Background: Severe hemorrhoids have a serious impact on patients’ quality of life. At present, the main method for treating severe hemorrhoids is surgery, but surgical treatment causes greater trauma to patients and has a high degree of complications. There is an urgent need to find new surgical methods to solve these problems. To assess the ability of tissue-selective therapy stapler (TST) minimally invasive surgery to treat severe hemorrhoids by studying the clinical efficacy, postoperative complications, and anal dynamics of selective supramedullary hemorrhoid stomy.\n\nMethods: In our hospital, between March 2015 and February 2018, 141 patients with severe hemorrhoids were included into three groups according to the block randomization method: the TST group, the pieces per hour the PPH group, and the eastern rubber band ligation and coincident of dislocation for prolapse and hemorrhoid (EPH)group. There were 47 patients in each group. The clinical efficacy of the three groups of patients, changes in hospital stay time, operation time, intraoperative blood loss, postoperative complications, and anal dynamic indicators (rectal resting pressure, anal resting pressure, anorectal pressure difference, rectal tolerance, rectal perception threshold and length of the anal high-pressure zone) were observed and compared.\n\nResults: The total effective rate in the TST group was 93.62%, which was higher than the 74.47% and 72.34% in the PPH and EPH groups, respectively, after treatment. Hospitalization time, operation time, and intraoperative blood loss were lower in the TST group than in the EPH and PPH groups. Three months after surgery, the rectal resting pressure, rectal tolerance, and rectal sensing thresholds of patients in the TST group were lower than those in the PPH and EPH groups, and the anal canal resting pressure, the anorectal pressure difference and the length of the anal high-pressure zone were greater than those in the PPH and EPH groups. After surgery, the complication rate in the TST group was 10.64%, which was lower than the 27.66% and 31.91% reported in the PPH and EPH groups, respectively.\n\nConclusion: Minimally invasive TST is effective in treating severe hemorrhoids, can significantly improve anorectal motility, has a low incidence of postoperative complications and is highly safe.",

The anal dentate line at the junction of the anal canal skin and the rectal mucosa is used as the boundary and can be divided into three categories: internal hemorrhoid, external hemorrhoid and mixed hemorrhoid. Some scholars believe that the cause of hemorrhoids is Thomson’s theory of downward movement of the anal cushion, that is, the thickening, displacement or combination of symptoms of an annular spongiform tissue band 1.5 cm above the dentate line, causing hemorrhoids to occur [ 2 ]. The main symptoms of severe hemorrhoids are blood in the stool or repeated prolapse of hemorrhoids, which have a serious impact on the patient’s quality of life [ 1 ]. Tissue-selecting hemorrhoidal mucosa anastomosis (TST) is a new technique developed on the basis of the procedure for prolapse and hemorrhoids (PPH). TSTs can be used to select the scope of hemorrhoidal mucosa resection according to the number and size of hemorrhoids. It is by far the safest minimally invasive technique in the anorectal diagnosis and treatment field. An anastomosis probe can be used to lock hemorrhoids, thereby maximizing the protection of the normal function of the anus [ 3 ]. PPH has an ideal “hanging” effect, but pathological anal pads have not been treated [ 4 ]. It is by far the safest minimally invasive technique in the anorectal diagnosis and treatment field. An anastomosis probe can be used to lock hemorrhoids, thereby maximizing the normal function of the anus [ 3 , 4 ]. This study used minimally invasive TST to treat severe hemorrhoids, aiming to observe its effects on clinical efficacy, postoperative complications, and anal dynamics in patients with severe hemorrhoids.\n\nMethods\n\nGeneral information\n\nA total of 141 patients with severe hemorrhoids who came to our hospital for treatment from March 2015 to February 2018 were selected and included into three groups, namely, the TST group, PPH group and EPH group, according to the block randomization method, with 47 patients in each group. Block randomization was used in this study, and the block size was set to 6. A computer random number generator was used to generate the random allocation sequence, and the research nurse independently completed the generation and sealing of the random sequence. The operating doctor could not know the specific grouping of patients in advance until the patient entered the operating room before surgery. Due to the obvious differences in surgical procedures, it is impossible to blind the patient and the surgeon, but postoperative follow-up indicators (such as anal dynamics indicators and postoperative complication evaluation) are all measured by a third party who is unaware of the study grouping to minimize observer bias.\n\nThe inclusion criteria for patients were as follows: met the diagnostic criteria of grades III to IV for hemorrhoids in the “American College of Colorectal Surgeons Clinical Practice Guidelines for Hemorrhoid Management” [ 5 ]; had no previous hemorrhoid-related surgery; were aged 18–80 years; had no surgical or anesthesia contraindications; and were informed and agreed to participate in this study. All patients signed the informed consent form.\n\nThe exclusion criteria were as follows: severe liver and renal dysfunction and cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases; coagulation disorders and severe blood system diseases; pregnancy or lactation; concomitant rectal and perianal diseases, such as anal fistula, perianal abscesses and anal fissures; and severe immune dysfunction. In the TST group, there were 24 male patients and 23 female patients, aged 21–55 years, with an average age of 39.64 ± 3.68 years, course of disease of 3.46 ± 2.12 years, 26 patients with stage III hemorrhoids, and 21 patients with stage IV hemorrhoids. In the PPH group, there were 25 male patients and 22 female patients, aged 22–61 years, with an average age of 41.39 ± 3.02 years, course of disease of 4.01 ± 1.97 years, 22 patients with stage III hemorrhoids, and 25 patients with stage IV hemorrhoids. The EPH group included 21 males and 26 females aged 25–57 years, with an average age of 41.29 ± 2.98 years and a disease course of 3.58 ± 2.66 years. There were 25 patients with stage III hemorrhoids and 22 patients with stage IV hemorrhoids. There was no significant difference in the general data, such as age or sex, among the three groups ( P > 0.05). See Table 1 .\n\nMethods\n\nBefore the operation, all patients in each group underwent routine clean enema, skin preparation, lumbar anesthesia, and maintenance of the lithotomy position.\n\nPatients in the TST group were treated with TST: an appropriate anoscope was selected according to the size and number of hemorrhoids. Moderate anal dilation, insert an anoscope, and rotate it so that the suprahemorrhoidal mucosa to be removed is completely within the open-loop window. Only suture the mucosa and submucosa to avoid damage to the muscular layer. Unscrew the tail fin of the stapler counterclockwise. After the head and body of the stapler are completely loosened, insert it into the anal dilator. Tighten the stapler with a homeopathic needle, so that the prolapsed rectal mucosa can be pulled into the stapler through the window of the anoscope. Inside the nail groove. After waiting for 25 to 30 s to fix the stapler body under resistance, loosen the tail fin counterclockwise for 3 to 5 turns and pull out the stapler. Observe whether there is active bleeding at the anastomotic site. If there is active bleeding, use an “8” shaped needle to stop bleeding. After the operation, the specimens removed during the operation were examined and sent for pathological examination [ 6 ].\n\nPatients in the PPH group were treated with PPH surgery: the skin at the anal edge of hemorrhoids was clamped non-invasive, the dilator and the matching inner core were inserted into the anus, and the inner core of the dilator was removed. The PPH stapler (Henan Chuangxin Medical Device Trading Co., Ltd.) is opened to the maximum extent, inserted its tip over the purse-string suture through the anal canal dilator, tightened the sutures one by one, and tied the knot. Use the matching suture holder to pull out the suture through the side hole of the stapler, tighten and fire the stapler until it is closed for 20 s to 25 s. Completely loosen and pull out the stapler, and observe whether there is active bleeding at the anastomosis. If there is active bleeding, use an “8” shaped needle to stop bleeding. After the operation, the specimens removed during the operation were examined and sent for pathological examination [ 7 ].\n\nPatients in the EPH group were treated with the eastern rubber band ligation and incision of dislocation for prolapse and hemorrhoid (EPH): the anal dilator assembly was inserted into the anus to fully expose the dentate line and internal hemorrhoid core. Suction mucosal tissue into the barrel of the ligator under negative pressure. When the negative pressure reaches a certain value, open the negative pressure to release the ligature tissue, and ligature 1 to 4 supra-hemorrhoid mucous membranes. Withdraw the inner cylinder of the high anoscope and tie 2 to 3 suprahemorrhoid mucous membranes in an inverted triangle shape. The anoscope was pulled out and the hemorrhoid was clamped with a hemostat [ 8 ].\n\nObservation indices\n\nClinical effect: The clinical effect of each group of patients was evaluated. Obvious effects: The clinical symptoms, such as hematochezia and hemorrhoidal nucleus prolapse, of patients basically disappeared. The patient’s hematochezia, hemorrhoidal nucleus prolapse and other symptoms significantly improved. Ineffective: The patient’s clinical symptoms and signs do not improve or even worsen [ 9 ].\n\nHospital stay, operation time, and intraoperative blood loss were recorded.\n\nPostoperative complications: The main complications that occurred in the patient were anal stenosis, urinary retention, pain and anal distention.\n\nAnal dynamics: Rectal resting pressure, anal canal resting pressure, anal canal rectal pressure difference, rectal tolerance, rectal perception threshold and anal canal high-pressure zone length were measured in each group of patients before and 3 months after surgery via an anal lateral pressure instrument (Sichuan Xintaili Electronic Technology Co., Ltd.).\n\nStatistical methods\n\nThe SPSS 22.0 software package was used for statistical data analysis, and an independent sample t test was used for measurement data comparison. Statistical data were compared via the χ 2 test. The Ridit test was used to compare grade data. The results with P < 0.05 were considered statistically significant.\n\n3Results\n\nComparison of clinical efficacy among all groups\n\nThe total effective rates in the TST group were 93.62%, 74.47% in the PPH group, and 72.34% in the EPH group, which were higher in the TST group than in the PPH and EPH groups (Table 2 ).\n\nHospitalization time, operation time and intraoperative blood loss were compared among all groups\n\nCompared with the EPH and PPH groups, the TST group had a shorter hospital stay (Cohen’s d = − 1.37, 95% CI [− 1.89, − 0.51], Cohen’s d = − 1.31, 95% CI [− 1.83, − 0.11]), shorter operation time (Cohen’s d = − 8.39, 95% CI [− 36.25, − 1.15], Cohen’s d = − 9.49, 95% CI [− 49.57, − 12.47]), and less intraoperative blood loss (Cohen’s d = − 8.00, 95% CI [− 16.44, − 2.49], Cohen’s d = − 10.02, 95% CI [− 19.36, − 2.47]) (Table 3 ).\n\nComparison of the anal dynamics indices in each group\n\nBefore the operation, there were no differences in rectal resting pressure, anal canal resting pressure, anal canal rectal pressure difference, rectal tolerance, rectal perception threshold or anal canal high-pressure zone length among the groups. At 3 months after the operation, the above indicators improved in all the groups, and the rectal resting pressure (Cohen’s d = − 8.12, 95% CI [− 16.87, − 5.87], Cohen’s d = − 8.77, 95% CI [− 15.02, − 6.13]), rectal tolerance (Cohen’s d = − 0.94, 95% CI [− 2.15, 0.27], Cohen’s d = − 1.03, 95% CI [− 2.27, 0.18]) and rectal perception threshold (Cohen’s d = − 2.99, 95% CI [− 5.12, − 1.03], Cohen’s d = − 3.18, 95% CI [− 5.37, − 1.36]) in the TST group were lower than those in the PPH and EPH groups, whereas the anal canal resting pressure (Cohen’s d = 9.74, 95% CI [6.21, 13.45], Cohen’s d = 10.80, 95% CI [7.32, 14.91]), anal canal rectal pressure difference (Cohen’s d = 16.03, 95% CI [12.55, 20.94], Cohen’s d = 14.90, 95% CI [11.07, 18.82]) and anal canal high-pressure zone length (Cohen’s d = 0.58, 95% CI [− 0.36, 1.76], Cohen’s d = 0.59, 95% CI [− 0.31, 1.85]) were greater than those in the PPH and EPH groups (Table 4 ).\n\nComparison of postoperative complications in each group\n\nAfter surgery, the incidence of complications was 10.64% in the TST group, 27.66% in the PPH group, and 31.91% in the EPH group. The incidence of complications in the TST group was lower than that in the PPH and EPH groups (Table 5 ).\n\nDiscussion\n\nHemorrhoids, also known as hemorrhoids, are common diseases in the anorectal department. If not treated in time, patients with severe hemorrhoids have symptoms such as hemorrhoid block prolapse and even adverse consequences such as sepsis in severe cases, seriously affecting people’s quality of life and health [ 10 ]. The theory of downward movement of the anal cushion was proposed by Thomson in 1975. The anal cushion is irreplaceable in maintaining anal self-control and is played by the mucosa, blood vessels and fibrous support structures on the inner wall of the anal canal. When the anal cushion becomes thickened, dislocated, and symptomatic, hemorrhoids form and require supportive treatment [ 11 , 12 ]. For patients with early hemorrhoids, methods such as diet therapy and topical anal medication are more effective, whereas for patients with severe advanced hemorrhoids, surgical treatment is the best treatment method [ 13 ]. The purpose of this study was to investigate the clinical efficacy, postoperative complications and anal dynamics of TST microsurgery in the treatment of severe hemorrhoids.\n\nBoth PPH and EPH are based on the theoretical basis of hemorrhoids caused by anal cushion lesions. PPH surgery involves the use of a PPH stapler to perform circular resection of the rectal mucosa prolapse zone above the hemorrhoids. While protecting the tooth line and the sensory epithelium in the tooth line area, the mucosa and submucosal blood vessels of the anal cushion are cut off to keep the anal cushion tissue relatively intact [ 3 , 14 ]. EPH is an innovative technique that effectively passes through the upper hemorrhoid mucosa through a misaligned ring for closed surgery, thereby reducing the risk of anastomotic stricture. Both surgical methods have the advantages of high safety and less pain. However, PPH surgery is rarer and has high rates of postoperative complications.\n\nMinimally invasive TST is based on the theoretical basis of “segmented-to-othed ligation”, which uses segmented resection and anastomosis to preserve normal rectal mucosa. In addition, the number of titanium nails implanted in TST surgeries is small, which greatly reduces the postoperative anal discomfort caused by titanium nails [ 15 ]. Minimally invasive TST has the advantages of accurately locating the prolapsed mucosa, mild surgical pain, high treatment safety and a short postoperative recovery time. Studies have shown that TST can significantly reduce patients’ postoperative pain and postoperative anal swelling, maximize the protection of anal cushion tissue and mucosal blood vessels, and thereby reduce the impact on the ability of the anus to accurately control feces [ 16 ]. Among the results of this group of studies, after treatment, the total effective rate of patients in the TST group was 93.62%, which was significantly higher than that in the PPH group and the EPH group (74.47% and 72.34%). The complication rate in the TST group was 10.64%, which was significantly lower than that in the PPH group and the EPH group (27.66% and 31.91%). This finding shows that TST surgery has an obvious curative effect in the treatment of severe hemorrhoids, has few postoperative complications, and is safe and reliable. TST surgery can effectively and selectively remove hemorrhoid tissue through a specific stapler, thereby reducing postoperative pain and complications. Some studies compared TST surgery with traditional MMH and reported that TST yielded better results in terms of postoperative recovery and patient satisfaction [ 15 ], which is similar to the results of this study.\n\nIn this study, the hospital stay time, operation time and amount of intraoperative blood loss in the TST group were significantly lower than those in the EPH and PPH groups. This finding shows that TST surgery for severe hemorrhoids can significantly shorten the time required for surgery and promote the rapid recovery of patients. Studies have shown that parameters such as anal resting pressure, maximum squeeze pressure, and anal high-pressure zone length may change significantly in patients with severe hemorrhoids. This study revealed that the anal dynamic indicators in each group significantly improved 3 months after surgery, and the rectal resting pressure, rectal tolerance, and rectal sensing threshold of patients in the TST group were significantly lower than those in the PPH group and EPH group. The anal resting pressure, anorectal pressure difference, and anal high-pressure zone length were significantly greater than those in the PPH and EPH groups. This finding shows that TST surgery for patients with severe hemorrhoids can effectively improve anal dynamic indicators. Analysis of the reasons for this result revealed that surgery resulted in greater structural integrity of the anal canal.\n\nThe latest Italian SIUCP guidelines point out that PPH is the gold standard for the treatment of grade III hemorrhoids [ 17 ]. TST is further optimized based on PPH. By accurately selecting and partially removing prolapsed rectal mucosa, it has short-term efficacy, safety and functional recovery. It has certain advantages. Lin et al. [ 15 ] compared TST with traditional Milligan-Morgan hemorrhoidectomy in a retrospective case–control study and found that patients in the TST group recovered faster after surgery, significantly reduced pain, lower complication rates, and significantly improved patient satisfaction. A recent prospective study reported by Huang et al. [ 6 ] also confirmed that TST is superior to traditional surgery and PPH surgery in improving anal dynamics and reducing postoperative complications in patients with hemorrhoids. The postoperative complication rate is significantly reduced, and patients recover more quickly after surgery. According to the results of a meta-analysis by Shi et al. [ 18 ], TST surgery seems to have advantages over circumcision and Milligan-Morgan-Morgan hemorrhoidectomy in reducing complications such as urinary retention, anal stricture, and fecal incontinence.\n\nHowever, this study still has some limitations. First of all, this study was not a double-blind trial because of different surgical procedures, which may lead to some bias in the results. Second, our study is based on a single-center study with relatively single and limited patient sources, which may affect the conclusion to a certain extent. In addition, the follow-up period of this study is only 3 months, which cannot fully assess the long-term recurrence and complications. Subsequent studies will conduct long-term follow-up for 1—3 years to further clarify the long-term efficacy and safety of TST surgery. In the next study, on the one hand, we need to continue to include research subjects, expand the sample size, establish a multi-center trial, and establish a long-term follow-up strategy, including patient subjective evaluation indicators including patient satisfaction score (VAS), pain score and recovery. Time for daily activities, in the hope of further understanding the impact of the surgical method on long-term outcomes and patients ‘quality of life.\n\nTo sum up, TST surgery has significant clinical effects in the treatment of severe hemorrhoids, with short treatment time and short postoperative recovery time. TST surgery can significantly promote the recovery of anorectal motivation in patients, and has low postoperative complications, high safety, and wide clinical application value.",
