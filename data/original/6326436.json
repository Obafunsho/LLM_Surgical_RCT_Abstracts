For many\nyears, left internal mammary artery (LIMA) has been routinely applied in CABG\nsurgery as \"first conduit of choice\" because of its resistance to atherosclerosis,\nespecially in older patients [ 4 ] . Radial artery (RA) is rarely used as a conduit in CABG\nsurgery, mainly because of its high tendency to vasospasm. However, the durability\nof RA as an arterial conduit is satisfactory: according to Acar et\nal. [ 5 ] ,\npatency rates were 93% after 9 months and 89% after 2 years. RA shows higher failure\nrates when grafted to right coronary artery (RCA) system than to left artery\ndescending (LAD) system. The failures should rather be attributed to the coronary\nartery than to the RA conduit because of the higher intensity of atherosclerosis in\nRCA [ 6 ] .\n\nRA can be applied as a classic conduit or Y-graft, with the proximal site connected\nwith LAD and the distal site grafted into coronary artery. Comparing RA grafts\ndurability with that of veins, RA is much more suitable for CABG: after 5 years of\nfollow-up, the patency of vessels was 98% vs . 86% [ 7 ] . Ferrari and\nSegesser [ 8 ] recommended RA as the \"second conduit of choice\", after the internal mammary artery,\nin CABG. Furthermore, it is worth to mention that according to mid-term outcomes in\nthe Radial Artery Patency and Clinical Outcomes (RAPCO) trial [ 9 ] , there was no essential\ndifference both in patients' free survival time and graft patency time between RA\nand right internal thoracic artery.\n\nSeveral techniques are available for bypass graft vessel predilatation during CABG\nsurgery. With an increasing use of RA as a graft, it is very important to understand\nhow the predilatation process can be pharmacologically controlled to improve graft\nfunction. We have already compared the vasodilatory effect and impact on endothelium\nof milrinone 0.4 mg/ml and papaverine 1 mg/ml [ 10 ] . Our previously research revealed that\npapaverine in concentration of 1 mg/ml exerts stronger vasodilatory effect on RA and\nreveals lesser damaging influence on its endothelial cells compared to milrinone 0.4\nmg/ml [ 10 ] .\nTaking into consideration these results, we continued the study comparing another\ntwo different doses of papaverine - two times lower (0.5 mg/ml) and two times higher\n(2 mg/ml).\n\nThe aim of this research was to examine the vasodilatory potential and effect of\ndifferent concentrations of papaverine on the endothelial integrity in the model of\nRA segments harvested from CABG patients.\n\nMETHODS\n\nPatients\n\nWe have examined 10 RA segments harvested from patients who underwent CABG\nsurgery. Clinical characteristics as body mass index (BMI), Canadian\nCardiovascular Society (CCS) scale, atherosclerosis risk factors, myocardial\ninfarction, and atrial fibrillation were taken into consideration and presented\nin Table 1 . All patients signed the\nwritten consent to participate in the study.\n\nArterial Rings\n\nEach vessel ring obtained during CABG surgery was cut into six or four smaller\nrings which were then exposed to organ bath (n=24) and histological examination\n(n=20).\n\nOrgan Bath\n\nOrgan bath experiments were carried out according to standards described\npreviously [ 10 - 13 ] . The organ chamber was\nfilled with 5 ml of Krebs-Henseleit buffer, containing 120 mM NaCl, 4.7 mM\npotassium chloride (KCl), 1.2 mM MgSO 4 , 1.2 mM KH 2 PO4, 2.5\nmM CaCl 2 , 25 mM NaHCO 3 , and 5.5 mM glucose, at\n37ºC. The rings were mounted between two hooks and were strained to the\nbaseline value of 20 mN. Stabilization to 20 mN was done before each\nmeasurement. The rings were precontracted with 20 mM KCl followed by increasing\nconcentrations (10 -9 to 10 -2 M) of phenylephrine (PE).\nNext, they were rinsed, stabilized, and immersed in solutions of papaverine\n(papaverinum hydrochloricum; Warszawskie Zakłady Farmaceutyczne Polfa\nS.A., Karolkowa, Poland) at 0.5 mg/ml (n=12) or 2 mg/ml (n=12). The vasodilatory\neffect was measured after 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, and 60 min, as described\npreviously [ 12 ] . After stabilization, 20 mM KCl was added to the\nchambers for 10 min to assess the spasm-preventing effect of papaverine. The\ntotal amount of tested rings in organ bath were n=24. The AcomPC (Siemens,\nGermany) software was used in all measurements.\n\nImmunofluorescence and Morphometry\n\nThe method was the same as in the first part of research [ 10 ] . Twenty arterial rings\nwere immersed for 20 min in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), in solutions of\npapaverine 0.5 mg/ml (n=10) or 2 mg/ml (n=10), and then fixed in 4% buffered\nformalin for 24 hours. After washing and freezing with PBS, 10 µm thick\ncryostat sections were obtained and the influence of vasodilators on endothelial\nintegrity was studied by immunofluorescence. All 20 rings were serially\nsectioned and used for immunohistochemical examination at every 20 th section. The sections were preincubated with 5% normal goat serum for 40 min,\nand then were incubated overnight with endothelial cell marker, a mouse\nmonoclonal anti-CD34 antibody (dilution 1:50; Novocastra, Newcastle, UK).\n\nSubsequently, sections were washed extensively in PBS and incubated for 90 min\nwith goat anti-mouse Cy-3-conjugated antibody (dilution 1:400; Jackson IR, West\nGrove, PA, USA), and then the cell nuclei were counterstained with DAPI (Sigma,\nSaint Louis, MO, USA). As previously, sections were washed three times in PBS\nand mounted in glycerol/PBS solution on the same pH=8.6. As in the first part,\nthe endothelial integrity was expressed as the mean percentage of the lumen\nperimeter immunopositive for CD34.\n\nStatistical Analysis\n\nVasodilatory effects of two different papaverine concentrations were checked for\nnormal distribution with the Shapiro-Wilk test. All results obtained by organ\nbath method and endothelial integrity measurements were expressed as mean\n± standard deviation or median (interquartile range; Q1-25 th percentile and Q3-75 th percentile) unless otherwise stated. To assess\nthe differences between two continuous variables, Student's t-test (for normally\ndistributed values) or the Mann-Whitney U test (for non-normally distributed\nvalues) were applied. To assess the differences between three continuous\nvariables, analysis of variance (ANOVA) test (for normally distributed values)\nor the Kruskal-Wallis test (for non-normally distributed values) were\napplied.\n\nRESULTS\n\nThe mean vasorelaxation of precontracted RA was stronger in vessel rings incubated in\npapaverine 2 mg/ml than in 0.5 mg/ml. The statistical significance was reached after\n30 min of incubation (papaverine 0.5 mg/ml, 65.19±20.21 vs. 2 mg/ml, 89.86±10.45; P <0.001; Figure 1 ). From the practical point of view, it means that the\nappropriate efficacy is reached after half an hour. The vasorelaxative effect was\nmaintained until the end of vessel examination (60 min).\n\nThe strongest inhibition of vasoconstriction induced by KCl was observed at the\nhighest papaverine dose (2.66±1.96 mN for 2 mg/ml vs .\n7.35±3.33 mN for 0.5 mg/ml; P <0.001; Figure 2 ).\n\nWe have also evaluated the impact of the examined papaverine concentration on\nendothelial integrity by calculating the percentage of vessel's circumference lined\nby endothelial cells, as revealed by immunofluorescence of their CD34 marker. The\nendothelial integrity was better preserved after treatment of RA rings with\npapaverine 0.5 mg/ml (72.86±9.3%) than with papaverine 2 mg/ml\n(50.23±13.42 %, P =0.002) ( Figure 3 ).\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nOur previous study has shown that when compared to milrinone, papaverine exerts a\nstronger vasodilatory effect on RA segments and more effectively inhibits their\ncontractile response to KCl and PE. However some studies confirm the dual effect of\nmilrinone and other [ 14 , 15 ] phosphodiesterase (PDE)\ninhibitors, which reveals an additionally important inotropic effect in medical\ntreatment.\n\nThere is no unanimous standpoint concerning papaverine concentration that should be\napplied in conduits predilatation. In many cardiovascular centers worldwide,\ndifferent doses of papaverine were examined and applied in predilatation of both RA\nand internal mammary artery. The efficacy of papaverine was proved for different\ndoses: 0.4 mg/ml [ 16 , 17 ] , 1 mg/ml [ 18 ] , 2.5\nmg/ml [ 19 ] ,\nand 4 mg/ml [ 20 ] .\n\nAt the Department of Cardiovascular Surgery and Transplantology, John Paul II\nHospital, where the investigation was carried out, the concentration of papaverine\napplied for RA predilatation associated with CABG surgery was usually 2 mg/ml.\n\nIn terms of vasodilatation and further vasoprotection force, the efficacy of the 0.5\nmg/ml papaverine concentration is much lower compared to the 2 mg/ml concentration,\nand the effects of these two concentrations are comparable; from this viewpoint,\nboth concentrations should be taken under consideration for practical use in CABG\nsurgery. However, papaverine 2 mg/ml caused the highest endothelial damage, at the\nlevel of almost 50%. Concentrations of 0.5 mg/ml resulted in much better\npreservation of endothelial lining.\n\nImmense damage of RA endothelium may lead to undesirable complications during the\nfirst postoperative hours in intensive care unit (ICU) because of severe deficiency\nof nitric oxide (NO), which is synthesized and secreted by endothelial cells. PDE\ninhibitors increases intracellular cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) and, as\nconsequence, the level of NO as well [ 21 ] . It is important to mention that, paradoxically,\nexcess level of PDE concentration causes endothelium destruction and, as a result,\nlower NO secretion. This might cause a situation when a few hours after CABG\nsurgery, the vasorelaxative and vasoprotective effects of papaverine disappear and\nthe deficiency of NO, one of the most potent vasodilators which is crucial for the\nregulation of the vascular tone, could lead to a sudden, uncontrolled RA spasm and\nheart muscle ischemia, creating a direct health hazard with all its consequences for\nthe patient, including low output syndrome or sudden death.\n\nFurthermore, the dysfunction of endothelium induces platelet activation releasing\nthromboxane A2, which is conductive to thrombosis formation inside the\nvessel [ 21 ] ,\nheightening complications in short post-operative period. To elude uncontrolled RA\nvasospasm, appropriate no-touch harvesting technique and predilatation should be\napplied. Additionally, it is worth to mention that using RA as a conduit following\nradial access coronarography is controversial and should be\navoided [ 22 ] .\n\nThus, taking into consideration the safety (percentage of undamaged endothelium) and\nour previous research [ 10 ] , papaverine at concentration 2 mg/ml should not be\napplied in RA predilatation. The efficacy (maximum vasorelaxation force) of 1 mg/ml\nexamined in the first part of the research [ 10 ] is almost identical, but at that\nconcentration papaverine shows significantly better preservation of the endothelium.\nOn the other hand, KCl and PE induced contraction of RA segments predilated by 0.5\nmg/ml and 1 mg/ml papaverine is stronger when compared with 2 mg/ml.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nPapaverine at 0.5 mg/ml concentration seems to be more suitable than at 2 mg/ml for\nprevention of vasospasm in RA conduits used for CABG. Papaverine at 2 mg/ml caused\nthe higher endothelial damage. Concentrations of 0.5 mg/ml caused better\npreservation of the endothelial lining.",
