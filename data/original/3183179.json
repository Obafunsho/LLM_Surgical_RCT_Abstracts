  "title": "Hypesthesia after Anterolateral versus Midline Skin Incision in TKA: A Randomized Study",
  "abstract": "Background: The anterior midline skin incision in a TKA provides excellent surgical exposure. However, it usually requires sectioning the infrapatellar branch of the saphenous nerve which may be associated with lateral cutaneous hypesthesia and neuroma formation.\n\nQuestions/purposes: We asked whether an anterolateral skin incision to the knee would decrease the area of skin hypesthesia and associated postoperative discomfort.\n\nPatients and Methods: We randomized 69 knees to receive a TKA through either a midline or an anterolateral skin incision. We assessed skin sensitivity by application of the Semmes-Weinstein monofilament at 13 reference points at 6 weeks and 6 and 12 months postoperatively. The area of hypesthesia was measured using Mesurim Pro 9 ® software. Patient knee ROM, Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), and WOMAC clinical score also were assessed.\n\nResults: The area of hypesthesia was less after an anterolateral compared with a midline incision up to 1 year after surgery: the areas of hypesthesia were, respectively, 32 cm 2 versus 76 cm 2 at 6 weeks, 14 cm 2 versus 29 cm 2 at 6 months, and 7 cm 2 versus 19 cm 2 at 1 year. Clinical scores and knee ROM were similar in both groups at each followup. At 1 year, in the entire group we observed a correlation between a smaller area of paresthesia and better WOMAC and KOOS scores and greater knee flexion.\n\nConclusions: Compared with the midline skin incision, the anterolateral incision is associated with fewer sensory disturbances and appears to be a reasonable alternative in TKA.\n\nLevel of Evidence: Level I, therapeutic study.
