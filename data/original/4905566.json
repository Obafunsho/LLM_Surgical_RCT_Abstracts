  "title": "Three Year Outcomes of Bariatric Surgery vs. Lifestyle Intervention for Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Treatment: A Randomized Trial",
  "abstract": "IMPORTANCE: Questions remain about the role and durability of bariatric surgery for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).\n\nOBJECTIVE: This study compared the remission of T2DM following surgical and non-surgical treatments.\n\nDESIGN: Randomized Controlled Trial\n\nSETTING: University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, in the United States.\n\nPARTICIPANTS and INTERVENTIONS: Outcomes were assessed 3 years after treating 61 obese participants with T2DM who were randomized to either an intensive lifestyle weight loss intervention for 1 year followed by a lower lifestyle weight loss intervention (LLLI) for 2 years or surgical treatments [Roux en Y gastric bypass (RYGB) or Laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding (LAGB)] followed by LLLI in years 2 and 3.\n\nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary endpoints were partial and complete diabetes remission and secondary endpoints included diabetes medications and weight change.\n\nRESULTS: Body mass index was <35kg/m 2 for 26 (43%) participants, 50 (82%) were women, and 13 (21%) African American. Mean (SD) values for weight were 100.5 (13.7) kg, age 47.3 (6.6) years, hemoglobin A 1c level 7.8% (1.9%), and fasting plasma glucose 171.3 (72.5) mg/dL. Partial or complete T2DM remission was achieved by 40% (n=8) of RYGB, 29% (n=6) of LAGB, and no LWLI participants (p=0.0037). The use of diabetes medications was reduced more in the surgical groups than the lifestyle alone group; with 65% of RYGB, 33% of LAGB, and 0% of LWLI going from using insulin or oral medication at baseline to no medication at year 3 (p<0.0001). Mean (SE) reductions in percent body weight at 3 years was the greatest after RYGB 25.0% (2.0), followed by LAGB 15.0% (2.0) and lifestyle treatment 5.7% (2.4) (p<0.01).\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Among obese participants with T2DM, bariatric surgery with 2 years of an adjunctive LLLI resulted in more disease remission than did lifestyle intervention alone.",
