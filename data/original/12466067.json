  "title": "The effect of sugammadex on postoperative urinary retention and recovery characteristics: a systematic review and meta-analysis",
  "abstract": "Background: Postoperative urinary retention (POUR) is a frequent complication following general anesthesia. There is growing interest in whether sugammadex, a neuromuscular blockade (NMB) reversal agent that does not require anticholinergic coadministration, might reduce its incidence. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the effects of sugammadex on POUR and other postoperative recovery outcomes, such as 30-day readmission rates and postoperative pain scores (POPS).\n\nMethods: PubMed, Cochrane, Embase, and Web of Science were comprehensively searched for studies published through June 3, 2024. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and cohort studies comparing sugammadex with conventional reversal agents or no reversal agents were included. Meta-analysis was performed using Stata 15.1 to synthesize the results.\n\nResults: The analysis ultimately included 25 studies involving a total of 163,367 patients: 84,362 received sugammadex, while 79,005 received neostigmine, or did not receive an antagonist.Meta-analysis revealed a significant reduction in the incidence of POUR with sugammadex use (Relative Risk (RR): 0.47, 95% Confidence Interval (CI): 0.34–0.64, P < 0.001). No meaningful differences were observed in POPS (Standardized Mean Difference (SMD): -0.01, 95% CI: -0.43–0.40, P = 0.945) or 30-day readmission rates (RR: 0.81, 95% CI: 0.65–1.01, P = 0.057).\n\nConclusion: These findings suggest that sugammadex substantially reduces POUR incidence, with no significant impact on POPS or 30-day readmission rates. Further research is warranted to explore its role in diverse patient populations and surgical procedures and to investigate its potential influence on postoperative pain management and readmission rates.\n\nSupplementary information: The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s12871-025-03334-1.",

  "full_text": "Introduction\n\nGlobally, an estimated 313 million surgical procedures are performed annually [ 1 ]. Among these patients, postoperative complications occur in 5.8–43.5% of cases [ 2 – 8 ], significantly influencing their postoperative recovery and clinical outcomes [ 9 ]. Common postoperative issues include fever, nausea and vomiting, intestinal obstruction, postoperative urinary retention (POUR) [ 10 ], acute kidney injury [ 11 ], and infections [ 12 ]. POUR has attracted particular attention in pelvic and joint replacement surgeries, as well as among older patients.\n\nPOUR occurs when patients cannot voluntarily void despite adequate bladder distention [ 13 ]. The reported incidence varies considerably, ranging from 5 to 70% in surgical populations [ 14 ]. Beyond the associated physical discomfort, POUR imposes significant psychological distress on affected patients [ 13 ]. Placement of urinary catheters also increases the risk of urinary tract infections and hemorrhage [ 15 , 16 ], prolongs hospital stays, and drives up healthcare costs [ 17 ]. Strategies to reduce POUR in the perioperative period are thus a key focus in efforts to improve patient outcomes. Previous investigations have identified several factors that contribute to the development of POUR, including patient age and sex, lower urinary tract symptoms, duration of surgery, intraoperative fluid volume, and anesthetic agents [ 13 , 18 – 21 ]. Beyond intrinsic patient factors, anesthetic drug selection remains a modifiable element in clinical practice that can influence POUR incidence.\n\nIn perioperative care, the choice of neuromuscular blockade (NMB) reversal agent is recognized as a factor influencing POUR incidence [ 14 ]. Neostigmine and sugammadex are widely used for NMB reversal. Multiple studies suggest that sugammadex administration reduces POUR incidence [ 22 – 30 ]. However, Chae et al. [ 31 ] noted that patients undergoing colorectal surgery had a higher proportion of discharge delays attributable to POUR when sugammadex was used. Evidence thus far has been inconsistent, and no consensus has been reached. Beyond POUR, studies investigating the impact of sugammadex on postoperative pain scores (POPS) and 30-day readmission rates have also yielded inconsistent results [ 32 – 35 ].\n\nGiven the absence of comprehensive analyses evaluating the impact of sugammadex on POUR incidence, POPS, and 30-day readmission rates, we conducted this meta-analysis to compare outcomes between sugammadex and cholinesterase inhibitor across diverse surgical procedures and patient populations. Our findings aim to provide evidence-based guidance for selecting NMB reversal agents.\n\nMethods\n\nThis study was preregistered on PROSPERO ( https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/PROSPERO/ ) under registration number CRD42024566663. All procedures were conducted in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement [ 36 ].\n\nInclusion and exclusion criteria\n\nThe study eligibility criteria were established following the PICOS framework (Population, Intervention, Comparison, Outcomes, Study design). The analysis included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and cohort studies of adult patients (aged ≥ 18 years) undergoing general anesthesia with NMB. The intervention group must have received sugammadex for reversal, while control groups received either cholinesterase inhibitors or no reversal agent. Studies were eligible if they reported at least one of three outcomes: POUR incidence, POPS (using either Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) or Visual Analog Scale (VAS)), or 30-day readmission rates.\n\nExclusion criteria encompassed meta-analyses, reviews, case reports, animal studies, guidelines, letters to editors, non-English publications, and studies where the full text or outcome data were inaccessible.\n\nLiterature search strategy\n\nTwo researchers comprehensively searched PubMed, Cochrane, Embase, and Web of Science from their inception through June 3, 2024, without regional or language restrictions. The search strategy relied on a combination of free-text terms and subject terms. Keywords included “post-operative,” “postoperative,” “surgery,” “operation,” “surgical,” “operative procedures,” “complication after operation,” “complication after surgery,” “sugammadex,” and “Bridion,” along with related synonyms. Detailed search strategies are provided in the supplementary materials.\n\nStudy selection\n\nRetrieved literature was imported into EndNote 21 for duplicate removal. Two investigators (ZN and ZZ) independently screened titles and abstracts according to predetermined eligibility criteria. Full texts of potentially eligible articles were then assessed. Disagreements were resolved through discussion with a third researcher.\n\nData extraction\n\nFor included studies, two researchers independently extracted data on study characteristics (author, country, study design), surgical procedures, sample size, age, intervention and control groups, and outcomes. Extracted data were cross-verified between investigators to ensure accuracy.\n\nQuality assessment\n\nQuality assessment was performed independently by two reviewers using standardized tools. For RCTs, the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool Version 2 (RoB 2.0) was applied [ 37 ]. Five domains were evaluated: randomization process, deviations from intended interventions, missing outcome data, outcome measurement, and selection of reported results. Each domain was rated as “low risk of bias,” “some concerns,” or “high risk of bias.” Studies with any domain rated as “high risk” were considered to have a high risk of bias, while studies with all domains rated as “low risk” were classified as having a low risk of bias.\n\nFor cohort studies, the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) was used to assess quality. The NOS included eight items in three domains: selection, comparability, and outcome. Comparability could receive a maximum of 2 points, and other items 1 point each. Studies scoring 7–9 points were designated as high quality, while those scoring 4–6 points were considered moderate quality. Any disagreement was resolved by a third reviewer to ensure consistency of judgments.\n\nStatistical analysis\n\nTo account for differences in assessment tools across studies and to eliminate dimensional effects, the Standardized Mean Difference (SMD) with 95% Confidence Intervals (CIs) was used for pooling data on the continuous variable of POPS. For dichotomous variables (POUR and 30-day readmission rates), the Relative Risk (RR) with 95% CIs was used for data synthesis. Statistical analyses were conducted using Stata version 15.1. Study heterogeneity was assessed using Cochran’s Q test and the I 2 statistic. In cases of significant heterogeneity ( P < 0.10 or I 2 > 50%), random-effects models were used; fixed-effects models were applied otherwise. For substantial heterogeneity, sensitivity and subgroup analyses were performed to explore potential sources. Publication bias was evaluated visually using funnel plots and quantitatively assessed using Egger’s test. If publication bias was detected, the trim-and-fill method was applied to assess its impact on pooled estimates. Statistical significance was set at P < 0.05.\n\nResults\n\nLiterature selection\n\nThe initial database search identified 4,661 articles; 1,883 duplicates were removed. After screening titles and abstracts, 2,706 articles were excluded. Full texts of 72 potentially eligible studies were reviewed; however, 15 articles were inaccessible. Among the 57 full-text articles assessed, 32 were excluded: 26 for incompatible outcomes, 4 for ineligible patient populations, and 2 for unsuitable study designs. The final analysis included 25 studies (Fig. 1 ).\n\nStudy characteristics\n\nThe analysis included 25 studies with 84,362 patients receiving sugammadex and 79,005 control subjects. The proportion of male subjects ranged from 0 to 95%. Mean ages in the sugammadex group ranged from 43.0 to 74.8 years, and from 43.0 to 75.1 years in the control group. Nine studies reported POPS, ten addressed POUR, and nine evaluated 30-day readmission rates. These articles, published from 2015 to 2024, originated from countries including China, the United States, South Korea, Australia, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom. Seven studies were RCTs, and 18 were cohort studies. Surgical procedures included abdominal, thoracic, otolaryngologic, lumbar, spinal, and joint replacement operations. Six studies reported the use of postoperative analgesics; although the types of analgesics varied, all were converted to morphine equivalents for comparison (Table 1 ).\n\nQuality assessment\n\nAmong the seven RCTs, two demonstrated a low risk of bias, four had an unclear risk of bias due to insufficient methodological reporting, and one trial [ 38 ] carried a high risk of bias owing to a lack of patient blinding (Fig. 2 ). The NOS scores for the 18 cohort studies ranged from 7 to 8 points, indicating robust methodological quality.\n\nIncidence of POUR\n\nTen studies examined whether sugammadex influenced POUR incidence. Substantial heterogeneity was noted ( I 2 = 74.8%), and thus a random-effects model was used. The pooled analysis demonstrated that sugammadex significantly reduced POUR incidence compared to control group (RR: 0.47, 95% CI: 0.34–0.64, P < 0.001) (Fig. 3 ).\n\nPOPS\n\nNine studies addressed the effects of sugammadex on POPS. A high level of heterogeneity was observed ( I 2 = 95.8%), and a random-effects model was used. The combined results indicated no significant difference in POPS between sugammadex and control group (SMD: −0.01, 95% CI: −0.43–0.40, P = 0.945) (Fig. 4 ).\n\n30-Day readmission rates\n\nNine studies provided data on 30-day postoperative readmission rates after sugammadex use. Heterogeneity was minimal ( I 2 = 6%), supporting the use of a fixed-effects model. No significant difference was found between sugammadex and control group in 30-day readmission rates (RR: 0.81, 95% CI: 0.65–1.01, P = 0.057) (Fig. 5 ).\n\nSubgroup analysis and Meta-Regression\n\nGiven the significant heterogeneity in POUR incidence and POPS, further analyses were conducted to explore its sources. For POUR, subgroup analyses were performed based on country, type of surgery, type of control group, and study design. Meta-regression analyses were conducted for type of surgery ( P = 0.064), age ( P = 0.872), and sex ( P = 0.21). For POPS, subgroup analyses were performed based on type of control group, type of surgery, study design, country, timing of pain score measurement, and score sheet type. Meta-regression analyses were conducted for type of surgery ( P = 0.698), age ( P = 0.757), sex ( P = 0.775), and timing of pain score measurement ( P = 0.294). These analyses did not definitively identify the primary sources of heterogeneity (Table 2 ).\n\nSensitivity analysis\n\nSensitivity analyses, performed by sequentially excluding individual studies and recalculating pooled results, evaluated the robustness of the findings for POUR (Fig. 6 ) and POPS (Fig. 7 ). The results for both outcomes remained stable, indicating that the overall conclusions were reliable.\n\nPublication bias\n\nFunnel plots were visually inspected to detect potential publication bias in the POUR (Fig. 8 ) and POPS (Fig. 9 ) analyses. Egger’s test was performed for a more formal assessment, and no significant publication bias was identified ( P = 0.938 for POUR; P = 0.863 for POPS).\n\nDiscussion\n\nThis meta-analysis of 25 studies evaluated the effects of sugammadex on POUR incidence, POPS, and 30-day readmission rates in patients receiving NMB reversal. The results showed that sugammadex significantly reduced POUR risk compared with control group, while there were no discernible differences in POPS or 30-day readmission rates.\n\nPOUR is a primary cause of unplanned readmissions after ambulatory surgery (27.8%) and 30-day readmissions (51.8%) [ 39 ]. The physiological process of micturition depends on parasympathetic-mediated detrusor muscle contraction and urethral sphincter relaxation [ 40 ]. Anticholinergic agents, including atropine and glycopyrrolate, interfere with this process through muscarinic receptor blockade, suppressing parasympathetic function and inducing detrusor muscle relaxation, thus precipitating POUR [ 41 ]. Neostigmine, a cholinesterase inhibitor, elevates acetylcholine levels and requires anticholinergic co-administration to prevent bradycardia and other adverse effects. Sugammadex functions through direct encapsulation of aminosteroid muscle relaxants, eliminating the need for anticholinergic agents. This distinct mechanism may explain its lower POUR incidence compared to control group [ 14 , 19 ]. While most included studies focused on abdominal procedures, three studies examined diverse surgery types [ 24 , 27 , 29 ]. Chau et al. [ 42 ] observed that, in inguinal hernia repair, POUR occurred less frequently with sugammadex regardless of operative approach, laterality, or wound class, consistent with findings reported by Troy et al.l [ 43 ]. Clinically, sugammadex was first approved in the European Union in 2008 and is now registered in 79 countries, including the United States and Japan. Due to its mechanism that does not affect acetylcholine metabolism, sugammadex demonstrates enhanced safety and is well tolerated in elderly patients, children, and patients with renal impairment [ 44 – 46 ]. Although sugammadex increases drug acquisition costs, it reduces overall hospital costs by decreasing postoperative complications [ 47 ].\n\nGiven the substantial heterogeneity in our results, subgroup analyses were performed by country, surgery type, control group type, and study design. Meta-regression analyses were conducted for surgery type ( p = 0.064), age ( p = 0.872), and sex ( p = 0.21), but none identified sources of heterogeneity. However, we observed that in the study by Chae et al. [ 31 ], the control group differed from other studies in that pyridostigmine was administered without concurrent anticholinergic agents such as atropine or glycopyrrolate. This distinction, which emphasizes the contractile effects of cholinesterase inhibitors on the detrusor muscle of the bladder, may have influenced their POUR outcomes.\n\nPostoperative readmission is a critical indicator of surgical and perioperative care quality. Previous work has suggested that readmissions following discharge are more frequently caused by newly arising, surgery-related complications rather than by the progression of complications observed during the initial hospitalization [ 48 ]. According to data from the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (ACS NSQIP), the overall rate of unplanned readmissions across six representative surgical procedures has been reported as 5.7%. Our meta-analysis identified no overall difference in 30-day readmission rates between reversal agents. In contrast, Tak et al. [ 35 ] reported a 34% reduction in 30-day readmission rates and 20% shorter hospital stays with sugammadex versus neostigmine in major abdominal surgery. This discrepancy might relate to the association between high-dose NMB and increased 30-day readmission risk in abdominal surgery, particularly in outpatient procedures [ 49 ].\n\nA 2016 meta-analysis of two trials (229 patients) reported no difference in postoperative pain between sugammadex and neostigmine [ 32 ]. Our analysis of nine studies (4,880 patients), focusing on POPS, confirms these findings. Similarly, in laparoscopic cholecystectomy patients, Tuna et al. [ 50 ] observed lower but not statistically significant differences in VAS scores and analgesic requirements with sugammadex. By contrast, Castro et al. [ 33 ] documented lower VAS pain scores at 30 and 60 min post-anesthesia care unit arrival with sugammadex versus neostigmine in laparoscopic bariatric surgery. This difference may relate to neostigmine’s cholinesterase-inhibiting properties. As a prokinetic agent, neostigmine stimulates gastrointestinal motility and anastomotic site movement in abdominal surgery patients, potentially increasing pain. Studies indicate higher postoperative nausea and vomiting scores with neostigmine compared to sugammadex [ 51 ], symptoms known to amplify postoperative pain and discomfort [ 52 , 53 ]. Additional evidence points to reduced postoperative VAS scores among obese patients who receive sugammadex compared with those of normal weight [ 54 , 55 ]. This improvement may be related to enhanced respiratory recovery after NMB reversal in morbidly obese patients undergoing elective laparoscopic surgery, potentially reducing adverse outcomes and contributing to better overall postoperative recovery [ 56 ].\n\nDue to substantial heterogeneity in the results, subgroup analyses were conducted by type of control group, type of surgery, study design, country, timing of pain score measurement, and score sheet type. Meta-regression analyses were conducted for type of surgery ( P = 0.698), age ( P = 0.757), sex ( P = 0.775), and timing of pain score measurement ( P = 0.294), none of which identified sources of heterogeneity. However, we found that the study by Yeliz et al. [ 57 ] differed from other studies in both objectives and results. This study aimed to explore the effect of atropine in preventing catheter-related pain and discomfort in patients undergoing transurethral resection due to bladder tumor. The study concluded that atropine could reduce the incidence of catheter-related bladder discomfort (CRBD) and further decrease suprapubic pain caused by CRBD, resulting in lower NRS scores. This finding suggests that concomitant anticholinergic drugs may confound comparisons of NMB reversal agents’ effects on POPS.\n\nStrengths\n\nThrough a systematic search across four major databases (PubMed, Cochrane, Embase, and Web of Science), 25 studies encompassing 163,367 patients were included. This analysis comprehensively explored the effects of sugammadex on POUR, POPS, and 30-day readmission rates, thus addressing previous gaps in meta-analytic literature and providing evidence-based guidance for perioperative care optimization.\n\nLimitations\n\nThis meta-analysis has several limitations. Substantial heterogeneity existed across study designs, sample sizes, surgical procedures, cholinesterase inhibitor and anticholinergic drug types, pain scale types, timing of pain assessments, age, and sex, potentially limiting result generalizability. Additionally, most included studies were retrospective cohort studies, which may introduce bias and require cautious interpretation of results. The subjective nature of pain assessment tools (VAS and NRS) and lack of long-term follow-up data limit evaluation of sustained benefits on recovery and readmission outcomes.\n\nFuture directions\n\nHigh-quality RCTs are needed to establish the efficacy of sugammadex in reducing POUR and improving postoperative pain management. Research across diverse surgical procedures and patient populations could identify optimal target groups. Pain management protocols should be standardized to more precisely evaluate the effects of sugammadex on postoperative outcomes. Sugammadex may be more effective than cholinesterase inhibition in reducing POUR.\n\nConclusion\n\nCompared with control group, sugammadex reduces POUR incidence following NMB reversal. However, the effects of sugammadex on POPS and 30-day readmission rates require further investigation. Given that most included studies were retrospective cohort studies with significant heterogeneity, results should be interpreted with caution. Future prospective RCTs targeting different surgical types and patient populations are needed to further evaluate the benefits of sugammadex across various surgical and patient contexts.\n\nSupplementary information\n\nBelow is the link to the electronic supplementary material.
