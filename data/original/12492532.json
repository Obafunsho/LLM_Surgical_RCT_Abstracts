  "abstract": "Background: The pathogenesis of new-onset postoperative atrial fibrillation (POAF) after off-pump coronary artery bypass graft (OPCABG) surgery remains to be partly known. The association between clopidogrel metabolizer phenotype and the occurrence of POAF was investigated.\n\nMethods: A total of 320 patients undergoing elective first-time OPCABG surgery and receiving 100 mg/day oral aspirin and 75 mg/day oral clopidogrel was reviewed from May 2017 to November 2023. These patients were categorized as normal metabolizer (NM), intermediate metabolizer (IM), and poor metabolizer (PM) according to cytochrome P450, family 2, subfamily C, polypeptide 19 (CYP2C19) genotyping. The incidences of POAF in the first week were compared using the log-rank test for cumulative risk. Platelet aggregability, inflammatory indexes, prothrombotic effect, and POAF burden were analyzed. Three phenotype categories were divided by genotyping as NM group (CYP2C19 1*1, n = 163), IM group (CYP2C19 1*2 or 1*3 n = 112), and PM group (CYP2C19 2*2 or 2*3, n = 45). The incidence of POAF after OPCABG was 20.9% in the NM group, contrasting with 35.7% in the IM group (hazard ratio [HR] versus NM group, 1.843; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.155 to 2.940; P = 0.0076) and 57.8% in the PM group ([HR] versus NM group, 3.363; 95% CI, 1.753 to 6.499; P < 0.0001). Adenosine diphosphate-stimulated platelet aggregation (17.8% ± 4.4% vs. 27.8% ± 4.3% vs. 37.2% ± 5.8%, F = 367.594, P < 0.001), inflammatory cytokines (interleukin-6, 43.5 ± 11.5 pg/ml vs. 46.8 ± 11.8 pg/ml vs. 51.2 ± 11.4 pg/ml, F = 8.471, P < 0.001), and prothrombotic effect (D-dimer, 2.1 ± 0.6 ng/ml vs. 2.4 ± 0.7 ng/ml vs. 3.2 ± 1.3 ng/ml, F = 37.61, P < 0.001) at 5 days after OPCABG, POAF burden (3.0% [1.2%, 6.1%] vs. 4.8% [2.4%, 11.9%] vs. 8.9% [4.8%, 17.4%], P < 0.001), and postoperative hospital stay (9.9 ± 1.6 days vs. 10.4 ± 1.7 days vs. 10.8 ± 1.7 days, P = 0.004) were notably lower in the NM group compared to the IM group and PM group.\n\nConclusions: The weaker CYP2C19 metabolizer phenotype was at the risk of developing POAF after OPCABG surgery with oral clopidogrel regimen.\n\nGraphical Abstract: The CYP2C19 metabolism phenotype was associated with a differential POAF incidence and burden, platelet aggregability, and inflammatory and prothrombotic responses after OPCABG at the same oral clopidogrel regimen.",

It is demonstrated that POAF burden is significantly higher in the early postoperative phase, and greater early-POAF burden potentiated long-term POAF recurrences (Gilbers et al. 2025 ).\n\nAntiplatelet therapy against thrombosis remains central for patients undergoing OPCABG (Zhu et al. 2022 ). The antiplatelet regimen in patients undergoing coronary artery revascularization remains to be continually updated for almost two decades (Members et al. 2021 ). Identifying the most appropriate antiplatelet therapy regimen for each patient to prevent thrombosis events is crucial for the management of patients with coronary artery disease, especially in the first few weeks after coronary artery revascularization (Luca et al. 2023 ).\n\nClopidogrel has been a classically utilized antiplatelet drug with the best balance between ischemic protection and bleeding. Cytochrome P450, family 2, subfamily C, polypeptide 19 (CYP2C19) is one of the principal enzymes, and its polymorphisms could greatly impact its antiplatelet efficacy. Those particularly Asian populations receiving clopidogrel treatment are at risk of composite events and recurrent coronary artery events if they carry the CYP2C19 loss-of-function (LoF) alleles (Sharma et al. 2024 ). Moreover, the individuals with CYP2C19 LoF alleles could be divided into intermediate metabolism (IM) and poor metabolism (PM) phenotypes in heterozygous and homozygous patients carrying one or two LoF alleles, respectively. Thus, we conducted this retrospective study to validate the hypothesis that the CYP2C19 metabolizer status was associated with divergent incidence rates of POAF and its burden in patients with clopidogrel-based dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) after OPCABG.\n\nMethods\n\nEthical statement\n\nThe study was reviewed and approved by Medical Ethical Review Board of Sichuan Provincial People’s Hospital (approval no. 2021215 on March 1, 2021), and patient consent was waived due to the retrospective nature of this study.\n\nPatients\n\nThe medical records of the patients undergoing elective first-time OPCABG between May 2017 and November 2023 were retrieved for this association analysis. The inclusion indexes were the patients (1) undergoing elective first-time OPCABG and (2) receiving postoperative DAPT including aspirin and clopidogrel. The exclusion criteria included preoperative atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter, or those taking antiarrhythmic agents other than beta-blockers, uncontrolled hyperthyroidism, acute stroke, ventricular aneurysm, multi-arterial grafts (Jiang et al. 2024b ), and postoperative conversion to other DAPT regimens. The primary outcome was the incidence of POAF in the first week after OPCABG. Secondary outcomes were plasma arachidonic acid (AA) and adenosine diphosphate (ADP)-induced platelet aggregation, inflammatory indexes, prothrombotic effect, and POAF burden.\n\nSurgical procedure and antiplatelet regimen\n\nA single surgeon performed all anastomoses via a median sternotomy under the same induction and anesthesia protocol. The procedure protocol was the left internal mammary artery (LIMA) anastomosed to the left anterior descending artery and SVG onto other target vessels with sequential or isolated methods including the diagonal (D) branch, obtuse marginal (OM) branch, posterior descending artery (PDA), or posterior branch of the left ventricle (PLV) (Jiang et al. 2020a ). Preoperative aspirin therapy (100 mg/day) was not discontinued before surgery. P2Y12 receptor inhibitors were conventionally withdrawn for at least 5 days up to the time of surgery. DAPT were initiated when postoperative mediastinal blood drainage volume was less than 30 ml for 2 h. Other postoperative medication regimens included beta-blockers, statins, rabeprazole for peptic ulcer prophylaxis, and diuretic makeup.\n\nClopidogrel metabolizer status\n\nClopidogrel metabolizer phenotype was investigated by defining the functional single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the CYP2C19 gene. CYP2C19 genotyping was performed using the polymerase chain reaction restriction fragment length polymorphism technique with abstracted peripheral monocytes. The primer sequences for CYP2C19*2 (681 G > A) were as follows: F: CAGAGCTTGGCATATTGTATC and R: GTAAACACACAACTAGTCAATG. The primer sequences for CYP2C19*3 (636 G > A) were as follows: F: TATGAAGTGTTTTATATCTAATGTTTACTCA and R: ACTTCAGGGCTTGGTCAATATAGA (Jiang et al. 2024a ). Clopidogrel metabolizer phenotype was defined as normal metabolizer (NM), intermediate metabolizer (IM), and poor metabolizer (PM) when there were no, one, and two CYP2C19*2 or CYP2C19*3, respectively.\n\nPlatelet function testing\n\nPlatelet aggregation was determined with multiple-electrode aggregometry after stimulation with AA at the concentration of 5 mmol/l and ADP at 3 μmol/l as agonists (Winter et al. 2019 ). The system detects the changes in electrical impedance due to the adhesion and aggregation of platelets on the electrodes. Whole blood anticoagulated with hirudin was obtained by venipuncture 1 day before OPCABG and 1 and 5 days after the procedure during the morning hours in a fasting state.\n\nInflammatory spectrum indexes\n\nA low-dose statin regimen was administered perioperatively, and achieving the target low-density lipoprotein (LDL) level (< 1.8 mmol/l) was deferred (Grundy et al. 2019 ). This target was managed postoperatively through stepwise intensification of lipid-lowering therapy in the outpatient clinic. All the patients were routinely transferred from the operating room to the general surgical ward via the transition of intensive care unit (ICU). The standard laboratory measurements for inflammation response indexes including neutrophil–lymphocyte ratio (NLR) were harvested from the electric medicine record system (Jiang et al. 2020b ). Human cytokines, including IL-6, were also measured by flow cytometry at the same timepoint postoperatively (Jiang et al. 2024c ).\n\nPOAF metrics\n\nPOAF was defined as the occurrence of atrial fibrillation confirmed using continuous telemetry monitoring and electrocardiography, which included the presence of electrocardiographic characteristics of atrial fibrillation and lasted for at least 30 s (Jiang et al. 2019 ). POAF burden was defined with POAF specific characteristics including the number of POAF episodes, duration of POAF episodes, and percentage of time spent in POAF during a given time period. Additionally, the longest and median duration of POAF episodes, median ventricular rate during POAF episodes, and total number of POAF episodes were determined (Consoli et al. 2025 ).\n\nStatistical analysis\n\nCox proportional hazard models were applied to determine potential variables associated with POAF. The risk factors for POAF were determined using logistic regression analysis. Kaplan–Meier analysis curves with log-rank test for cumulative risk were used to describe the time-dependent incidence of POAF in three groups and calculate the hazard ratios in the primary endpoint between weaker metabolizer phenotype groups and normal metabolizer phenotype group. The three groups were compared using one-way analysis of variance. Continuous variables are reported as median [interquartile range] or mean ± SD (standard deviation), depending on data distribution, which was determined using the Kolmogorov–Smirnov test. The differences in platelet aggregation parameters between the two timepoints were compared by paired t -test. Categorical variables were expressed as absolute values with proportions in percentage, which were compared using the χ 2 test or Fisher’s exact test. All statistical procedures were performed using the SPSS software version 25.0 and GraphPad Prism version 10.0. P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant at two sides.\n\nResults\n\nA total of 409 patients were screened according to the inclusion criteria, and 89 patients were subsequently excluded. At final, 320 patients were eligible for the final analysis and were divided into the NM group (of 163 patients, 50.9%), the IM group (of 112 patients, 35.0%), and PM group (of 45 patients, 14.1%) (Fig. 1 ). Patient characteristics at baseline were similar among the three groups (Table 1 ). There were also no statistically significant differences in graft characteristics, including the number of distal anastomoses, grafts, and intraoperative transit-time flow measurements.\n\nThe results of the logistic regression analysis showed that only CYP2C19 metabolizer phenotype was statistically significant for POAF incidence ( P < 0.001). Overall, POAF after combined antiplatelet drugs occurred in 34 of 163 patients (20.9%) in the NM group versus 40 of 112 patients (35.7%) in the IM group (hazard ratio [HR] versus NM group, 1.843, 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.155 to 2.940; P = 0.0076) versus 26 of 45 patients (57.8%) in the PM group ([HR] versus NM group, 3.363, 95% CI , 1.753 to 6.499, P < 0.0001; Fig. 2 ).\n\nA similar platelet inhibition regimen was administered during the hospitalization stay. The time to discontinue and initiate the oral antiplatelet regimen including clopidogrel before and after OPCABG was similar among the three groups. Platelet aggregation increased significantly after the operation compared to the preoperative baseline values in the whole population ( P < 0.001); however, the increase in AA- and ADP-induced platelet aggregation was significantly inhibited on day 5 compared with those at 1 day after operation. The AA-stimulated platelet aggregation was similarly lower among the three groups at day 5 after OPCABG (23.0% ± 4.6% versus 23.1% ± 4.6% versus 23.2% ± 5.0%, F = 0.054, P = 0.947), and ADP-stimulated platelet aggregation remained at a further lower level in the NM group than that in the IM and PM groups at day 5 after OPCABG (17.8% ± 4.4% versus 27.8% ± 4.3% versus 37.2% ± 5.8%, F = 367.594, P < 0.001; Fig. 3 upper). The levels of inflammatory indexes were comparable on the 1 st day after OPCABG among the study groups, while the inflammatory indexes at 5 days after OPCABG were lower in the NM group than those in the IM group and PM group (IL-6: 43.5 ± 11.5 pg/ml vs. 46.8 ± 11.8 pg/ml vs. 51.2 ± 11.4 pg/ml, F = 8.471, P < 0.001, and NLR: 3.6 ± 1.0 vs. 4.2 ± 1.1 vs. 4.8 ± 1.2, F = 21.434, P < 0.001;Fig. 3 Middle). Platelet counts were not statistically different among the three groups before operation and at 1 day and 5 days after the operation. The levels of the prothrombotic index were increasing among the study groups, while d-dimer levels at 5 days after OPCABG were lower in the NM group than those in the IM group and PM group (2.1 ± 0.6 ng/ml vs. 2.4 ± 0.7 ng/ml vs. 3.2 ± 1.3 ng/ml, F = 37.61, P < 0.001; Fig. 3 bottom).\n\nA lower postoperative hospital stay was significantly reduced in the NM group than those in the IM group and PM group (9.9 ± 1.6 days vs. 10.4 ± 1.7 days vs. 10.8 ± 1.7 days, P = 0.004, Table 2 ). Mean (SD) values for ventricular rate (bpm) were not different at the incidence of POAF episodes among the three groups. POAF burden remained lower in the NM group compared to that in the IM group and the PM group within 1 week after OPCABG (3.0% [1.2%, 6.1%] vs. 4.8% [2.4%, 11.9%] vs. 8.9% [4.8%, 17.4%], P < 0.001). POAF episodes duration was also lower in the NM group compared to that in the IM group and the PM group ( P = 0.003, Table 3 ).\n\nDiscussion\n\nThe most important findings of this retrospective cohort study are the following: (1) CYP2C19 metabolism phenotype was associated with divergent incidence rate of POAF after OPCABG in patients receiving the aspirin- and clopidogrel-based DAPT regimen, and (2) PM and IM had a higher incidence of POAF and its burden, associated with a higher platelet aggregation response to ADP, an activated inflammatory and coagulation–fibrinolysis response.\n\nPOAF is defined as new-onset atrial fibrillation after OPCABG surgery, which was associated with increased risk of ischemic stroke, thromboembolism, heart failure hospitalization, and recurrent atrial fibrillation. However, early initiation of oral anticoagulation was not associated with reduced risk of ischemic stroke or any thromboembolism but with increased risk for major bleeding (Taha et al. 2021 ). Thus, aiming at reducing the occurrence of POAF and its consequences is warranted in perioperative management.\n\nPOAF occurs at different rates depending on the type of cardiac operation (Gaudino et al. 2023 ). The inherent divergence among the population holds true, but it was not comprehensively investigated. Aside from the racial disparity (Efird et al. 2017 ) and gender differences (Paquin et al. 2024 ), there are other demographic characteristics, like gene polymorphism, which are associated with POAF (Kertai et al. 2014 ). In the evolving era of contemporary reperfusion treatment, antiplatelet treatment becomes even more crucial on account of the fact that the use of β -blockers in patients with acute myocardial infarction and preserved left ventricular ejection fraction does not any longer reduce long-term mortality and cardiovascular complications (Yndigegn et al. 2024 ). Clopidogrel, instead of third-generation PY2Y12 inhibitors (prasugrel or ticagrelor), is the most used antiplatelet treatment regimen in surgical practice (Kumar et al. 2023 ). Moreover, physicians were divergent on the mandatory provision of routine genotyping and how to respond to CYP2C19 reduced metabolizer status in clopidogrel-treated patients (Povsic et al. 2019 ). Thus, to explicitly elaborate on the association between CYP2C19 metabolism phenotype and the incidence rate of POAF after OPCABG in patients receiving clopidogrel is of clinical significance for making reasonable precautions.\n\nClopidogrel is a prodrug requiring bioactivation by hepatic CYP2C19. Platelet function tests showed that clopidogrel had a diverse range of platelet aggregation after ADP induction on the same dosage regimen grouped by metabolizer phenotype. This phenomenon was described as clopidogrel “non-responsiveness,” “resistance,” or high posttreatment platelet reactivity to ADP for weaker CYP2C19 metabolizer phenotype. Activated platelets by OPCABG release inflammatory mediators such as IL-6 that support the chemotaxis, adhesion, and migration of leukocytes to areas of inflammation and the development of circulating platelet-leukocyte aggregates, the protagonists of inflammatory reactions in the vessel wall (Băghină et al. 2024 ), which was paralleled by an increase of NLR. P2Y12 inhibitors decrease the platelet-leukocyte interactions, which play a role in the pathogenesis of inflammation, including leukocyte recruitment, proinflammatory cytokine production, and activation of coagulation in an experimental human sepsis model (Thomas et al. 2015 ). After OPCABG in the postoperative first week, there was a persistence of the inflammatory phenotype like acute myocardial infarction, even with the highly effective lipid-lowering and antiplatelet therapies (Silva et al. 2023 ). Apart from the heightened platelet aggregation and prothrombotic changes, a bigger atrial fibrillation burden on weaker CYP2C19 metabolizer phenotype was another supporting evidence on individuals to facilitate POAF’s maintenance and initiation. This coincidence in the timeframe supported the concepts that the CYP2C19 metabolizer phenotype is associated with divergent POAF incidence via differential inflammation response levels at 5 days after surgery at the same antiplatelet regimen, which is indicated by an inter-individual variation in residual inflammation.\n\nDuring the short-term follow-up, patients with PM had a longer POAF episodes duration and postoperative length of stay than the patients with NM. The most important clinical significance of this study was to broaden the theory on the pathophysiology and prophylaxis of POAF. It is instructive for clinical practitioners to initiate the CYP2C19 metabolic genotyping, platelet function test, and inflammatory cytokines to monitor the metabolic activity for POAF individuals. Personalized instead of the immobilized antiplatelet regimen, especially for PM individuals, should be noted to resolve the disparities of drug metabolism and then minimize the adverse effects, including longer postoperative length of stay and relevant medical expenses.\n\nNewer P2Y12 inhibitors have a more rapid onset of action and less interindividual variability in platelet inhibition than clopidogrel but are associated with an increased risk of bleeding. Tailoring antiplatelet treatment based on genetic variants can potentially result in optimized dosing or a change in drug selection. This aim may be achieved by temporal modulation (early escalation and late de-escalation) of antiplatelet therapy including by changing the type, dosage, or number of antiplatelet drugs via the guidance from CYP2C19 genotyping screening (Capodanno et al. 2023 ).\n\nStudy limitations\n\nFirstly, this was a retrospective cohort study based on CYP2C19 phenotype, not a randomized study. Secondly, CYP2C19*17 genotyping was not performed. Although the prevalence of CYP2C19*17 is low (< 0.5%) in the population (Fukui et al. 2024 ), its presence could confer a rapid metabolizer phenotype even in carriers of the *2 or *3 loss-of-function alleles. Thirdly, POAF incidence and burden were assessed only during the first postoperative week. This period represents the highest-risk interval for POAF after OPCABG (Jiang et al. 2024e ), and longer-term monitoring was also essential.\n\nConclusions\n\nThe present cohort study demonstrated that the weaker CYP2C19 metabolizer phenotype was associated with a higher incidence of POAF and burden after OPCABG in patients receiving the same oral dose of clopidogrel. The association between CYP2C19 metabolizer phenotype and the incidence of POAF after OPCABG is conducive to understanding the pathogenesis of POAF and promoting a preemptive prevention strategy.",
