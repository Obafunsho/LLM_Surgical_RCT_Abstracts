The combination of AI and robotic technology could eventually make doctors and surgeons obsolete. The potential is limitless, but early adoptive AI practices in research and education are already being realized. The use of AI to assist physicians in decision-making and practicing evidence-based medicine is one such area. This study addresses the knowledge gap of whether AI has utility in supporting clinician decision-making by safely and accurately performing systematic reviews of published evidence. Negative-pressure wound therapy (NPWT) has been a mainstay of open wound management strategies since Morykwas et al 1 described its successful use in animal models in 1997. NPWT combines the sealing of open-cell foam into a wound, and the application of subatmospheric pressure, to promote healing by secondary intention. 2 – 4 The clinical success and relatively low cost of NPWT led to a rapid expansion of its use in acute traumatic and chronic wound management. 5 Over time, NPWT has expanded in scope and has been incorporated into the treatment of nontraumatic wounds, including ulcers, burns, and open surgical abdominal wounds. 4\n\nDespite the widespread use of NPWT due to its purported benefits, the literature on NPWT presents a heterogeneous body of evidence. Studies typically focus on individual indications for specific anatomical locations. Although there have been numerous literature reviews, they present either a mixed response on the cost-effectiveness and efficacy of NPWT or focus on specific populations that are not generalizable. 6 – 9 NPWT is, therefore, an ideal topic to use to study the ability of AI to review complex levels of evidence and to compare this to human evaluation. Although this is a review article, there is still clinical relevance concerning NPWT and general clinical applications regarding the use of AI in clinical decision-making.\n\nThe rationale for this study is that it is unknown whether AI can safely/effectively review articles. The goal is to evaluate the capabilities of AI to assess the quality of evidence during a literature review in the form of Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations (GRADE) for each article included in our literature review to further establish a potential avenue of utility of AI in research.\n\nMETHODS\n\nArticles were collected from PubMed, SCOPUS, and CINAHL with the assistance of a librarian. Articles were limited to English and those published in the last 15 years. The Medical Subject Heading terms and keywords used to conduct the search are described in Table 1 . After removing duplicates, abstracts from the 156 remaining articles were screened for relevance using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis guidelines (Fig. 1 ).\n\nStudies were included where endpoints of infection rate (IR), wound closure (WC), and length of stay (LOS) were evaluated, and NPWT was a major aspect of the intervention in the settings of reconstructive surgery. Case reports were not included. Other systemic reviews, case reports, and studies performed on animal models were excluded. Three blinded reviewers analyzed all 156 abstracts and individually voted on eligibility based on inclusion criteria (Fig. 1 ). In cases where the vote was not unanimous, all reviewers discussed the merits of the article and its relevance to the study until a consensus was reached. Based on these inclusion criteria, 55 articles were selected for further eligibility. Of these, further screening for inclusion criteria and applicable studies to use the GRADE framework provided 18 eligible studies for this systematic review using the AI program GPT-4. A GRADE framework was assigned to each study using an AI model (GPT-4) trained to apply the GRADE criteria to a full-text article. The prompt instructed the model to apply current GRADE criteria to assign a score of high, moderate, low, or very low. This was accomplished by training the AI program by inputting the current GRADE criteria into the AI program. Next, the desired article was input into the AI program, which was asked to apply the GRADE criteria and the scores discussed earlier. To ensure accuracy, we also prompted the AI program to justify the reason for the assigned score, which was then reviewed by a human reviewer. There was no instruction in the prompt to bias the AI program. Two reviewers independently reviewed the same articles and assigned a GRADE score manually based on current criteria. Tables were compiled detailing the authors, type of study, number of participants, and statistically significant findings.\n\nRESULTS\n\nThere were a total of 18 studies included in this review investigating the effects of NPWT on wounds arising from a variety of etiologies (Table 1 ). Study designs included 9 randomized controlled trials (RCTs), 2 case-control studies, 3 cohort studies, and 4 observational/miscellaneous studies, with a total of 3131 patients.\n\nArtificial Intelligence\n\nAfter following the GRADE criteria, we found there to be 2 articles of high-quality evidence, 8 articles of moderate-quality evidence, and 8 articles of low-quality evidence. AI was instructed to follow a prompt to apply the same criteria to each article, and the results were 1 article of high-quality evidence, 9 articles of moderate-quality evidence, 7 articles of low-quality evidence, and 2 articles of very low evidence.\n\nLength of Stay\n\nThere were a total of 7 studies (1279 patients) that included results pertaining to the effect of NPWT on LOS. 10 – 16 These 7 articles consisted of 3 RCTs, 2 case-controlled comparisons, 1 retrospective analysis, and 1 prospective longitudinal study. The etiology of the wounds being dressed with NPWT included abdominal wall closure, surgical wounds, traumatic wounds, free flaps, and chronic wounds. Out of the 7 articles investigating LOS, 5 articles had significant improvements following NPWT usage, and 2 articles found no significant changes. Of the 2 articles with insignificant findings, neither were categorized as RCTs and included a retrospective review 16 and a prospective longitudinal study. 10 The 2 RCTs looking at LOS for NPWT use found a significant decrease in LOS. 10 , 11\n\nInfection Rate\n\nFourteen articles (2201 patients) in this review discuss the impact NPWT has on IRs in reconstruction procedures (Table 2 ). These 14 articles consisted of 8 RCTs, 2 prospective longitudinal studies, 2 case-control studies, and 2 retrospective studies. The etiology of the wounds being dressed with NPWT included abdominal wall closure, surgical wounds, traumatic wounds, free flaps, and chronic wounds. Seven RCTs addressed NPWT’s effect on IRs, with 3 finding significant results. 18 , 21 , 22 When addressing study validity through GRADE, the significant studies had a higher level of validity when compared with the insignificant studies for NPWT’s effect on IR. Significant studies 10 , 12 – 16 , 18 , 20 – 22 had GRADE scores of high (1), moderate (5), low (2), and very low (2), whereas insignificant studies 11 , 19 , 23 , 24 had GRADE scores of low (4).\n\nWound Closure\n\nTwelve articles (2233 patients) in this review discuss the impact NPWT has on WC rates (Table 3 ). These 12 articles consisted of 5 RCTs, 5 prospective longitudinal studies, and 2 case-control studies. The etiology of the wounds being dressed with NPWT included abdominal wall closure, surgical wounds, traumatic wounds, free flaps, and chronic wounds. Of the 3 variables addressed in this review, WC had the highest ratio of significant 12 – 15 , 19 , 25 – 28 to insignificant 22 , 23 , 29 (9:3) findings. Both RCTs looking at WC had insignificant results. 22 , 30\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nThus, although there have been RCTs investigating NPWT, it is very challenging to design wound studies that can control for wound size, location, microbiome, vascular status of the wound, and/or exposed vital structures among other confounders. Hence, the levels of evidence in clinical wound care research are often low, as reflected by our results. Given these challenges, it is appropriate to evaluate the ability of AI to recognize these issues and aid us in accurately assigning weight to the evidence we use to direct clinical decision-making.\n\nInitially used to treat traumatic wounds, the indications for NPWT have expanded to include chronic wounds, ulcers, surgical incisions, abdominal wall closures, skin grafts, and free flaps, among other etiologies. The mechanism of negative pressure on wound healing has been investigated and relates to increased granulation of damaged tissue and increased wound healing, which explains the significant studies identified in this review relating to all 3 variables that are wound-healing dependent. 31 NPWT can be applied directly to superficial fascia following trauma or postoperatively to create a sealed environment and minimize contamination. 24 Critiques of NPWT reflect on the lack of a mechanistic relationship between the effects of topical pressure and wound healing being definitively shown, and on the methodological flaws in many of the clinical studies. 32 Despite these concerns, many wound care practitioners and surgeons find NPWT to be a convenient and practical dressing choice.\n\nRole of AI in Literature Review\n\nThis review attempted to streamline this process using the help of the open-access AI program GPT-4. GPT-4 was able to accurately summarize long articles, allowing us to select articles based on inclusion criteria as well as assign a GRADE score based on current guidelines. Once these articles were selected, a script was imputed into GPT-4, instructing the program to extract the variables LOS, WC, and IRs. After these variables were reported, they were manually verified to ensure accuracy. The AI program worked effectively and only seemed to struggle with classifying what data would fit the criteria set, such as taking a time measurement out of context and reporting it as LOS data. A notable observation was that GPT-4 was able to extract information pertinent to our study that was subtly reported in the article and was not an obvious finding highlighted in the summary or abstract. There were several articles where the AI program and reviewers had differing scores; there are several possible explanations for this, not limited to the fact that the GRADE criteria are subjective, and with this, differing amounts of emphasis can be placed on aspects of the criteria, which may lead to varied scores. There is also the possibility that human error is a possible source of varied scores, whereas subjective scoring systems can be a limitation for an AI program. With a human review team analyzing a large volume of articles, the possibility of errors in scoring through manual review is always a potential study limitation. The utility of AI in literature review and meta-analysis has been identified. However, the extent of AI integration into future practice remains a mystery. Using an AI program in a large systematic review can act as a strong tool for organizing articles as well as consolidating and searching for desired outcomes in articles. When applying any criteria or parameters to a large volume of articles, AI allows for the same prompt to be followed and avoids variations that would normally be present with a team of reviewers who will inherently have differing subjective opinions.\n\nSignificance of NPWT\n\nIn cases of traumatic injuries and diabetic wounds, a modest yet consistent quality of evidence emerges in favor of NPWT usage. In contrast, the support for its effectiveness in reconstructive surgery is less pronounced, highlighting an area of emphasis for further studies. There is a presence of significant evidence favoring NPWT in at least half of the studies across all measured variables. It is worth noting that these supportive articles generally possess lower levels of evidence scores. Nonetheless, this consistency suggests a potential benefit of NPWT.\n\nThere was a near-even split of significance for all articles included in this review, with significant studies generally having a lower GRADE score when compared with insignificant studies. A likely reason for such inconclusiveness and debate in NPWT studies is the inconsistency that follows wound research, such as wound size, location, depth, and the inability to control external factors that are not addressed in each article. 31 In the Älgå et al 32 study on conflict-related wounds, their conclusion of insignificance could be due to their choice of endpoint, which was set as a composite of WC by day 5 and freedom from any bleeding, wound infection, sepsis, or amputation of the index limb. This endpoint would most likely be unrealistic, given the nature of the injury, and too short to accurately assess significant differences in wound healing, considering that it takes approximately 5 days for re-epithelization to begin and infections after a traumatic injury can occur 12–15 days postinjury. 33 , 34 These confounding variables and lack of consistency contribute to the mixed findings in NPWT efficacy studies, as LOS, IR, and WC are all dependent on the specific type of wound and variables not accounted for by each study. 8 , 30\n\nThroughout the literature, the more detailed and methodologically sound a study was, the higher the likelihood it had of producing insignificant results. This can be seen when comparing the Wound Management of Open Lower Limb Fractures (WOLLF) trial 17 to other RCTs: the WOLLF trial had the highest GRADE score and found NPWT insignificant for multiple variables, yet other RCTs with lower GRADE typically had significant results for the same variables. 12 , 17 Due to the inherent difficulty in designing generalizable wound studies and controlling for outside variables, there is weak GRADE evidence that NPWT has improved effects on the variables investigated in this review.\n\nWC Variability\n\nAn important consideration is the use of NPWT and its significance in different wound types. Most of the significant evidence linking NPWT to faster WC comes from isolated cases of trauma or patients with comorbidities, such as diabetic patients with foot ulcers. 22 , 28 Part of the struggle to define the efficacy over a wide range of etiologies is the fact that some applications are predisposed for certain results, such as a planned surgical free flap compared with a trauma wound, and the vast variation in patient-related comorbid factors. This trend leads to the assumption that NPWT is only significant when applied on wounds that are less likely to have uncomplicated healing. The heterogeneity of NPWT application in wound treatment is 1 reason why there is such controversy in large-scale randomized control studies over the significance of NPWT.\n\nStudy Limitations\n\nA literature review on NPWT faces various limitations. The diverse nature of study designs, patient demographics, and NPWT application methods contributes to heterogeneity, challenging direct comparisons. The quality and quantity of evidence vary, with potential biases due to publication tendencies favoring positive results. The evolution of NPWT technology might yield some outdated literature, impacting the study’s relevance. Additionally, limited long-term follow-up data, confounding variables beyond NPWT (such as comorbidities and the application to many trauma-related injuries), and nongeneralizable findings pose challenges. Addressing these limitations is crucial to ensure a comprehensive and accurate assessment of NPWT’s efficacy across different clinical contexts.\n\nRegarding our use of AI to assess the quality of evidence of research articles, we were limited by a relatively small number of articles that fit our inclusion criteria for the initial review article to generate a broader scale human–AI comparison of significant statistical power. Notably, limiting our literature review to English articles published in the last 5 years excludes substantial contributions published in German and a great deal of foundational literature from the 1990s and early 2000s. The GRADE scale is also inherently subjective, such as assessing for possible risk of bias, which makes comparing AI to a subjective human score difficult as there is not always an obvious right answer. The comparative risk of bias between humans and AI is unknowable at this stage and warrants further analysis. There is also an unknown risk of bias when using an AI program to subjectively score a scholarly article. The AI program was explicitly instructed to remain unbiased, but when using AI, there is no real way to screen for unknown biases built into the algorithms driving these programs or biases that develop as these AI programs apply machine learning.\n\nSpecific criteria for standardization and maximal control over RCTs in NPWT studies are needed to confidently understand the efficacy of NPWT on LOS, IR, and WC. Such direction can be implemented first in animal studies, where constant wound size, location, and conditions during healing stages can be tracked to eliminate the confounding variables addressed earlier.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nThe use of AI in supporting physicians in practicing evidence-based medicine is an exciting prospect. This article has achieved proof of concept but also shown differences in evidence grading between human and algorithmic analysis. Understanding these differences is critical to assessing the safety of the use of AI in supporting medical decision-making. Our systematic review was able to derive 18 articles with varying GRADE scores to conclude that there are varying degrees of endorsement for NPWT application in cases of traumatic, burn, surgical, and diabetic wounds. We assessed the efficacy of AI to assess the quality of evidence and aid in the review process, finding that although making a direct human comparison is difficult, especially with subjective applications, there is promise for future development.\n\nThere remains, however, the ambiguity of NPWT significance in reconstructive settings. The diversity of wound type, healing time, and confounding variables highlighted in several articles reviewed by this study prevent solidified findings in RCT evaluating NPWT. Despite these concerns, many wound care practitioners and surgeons find NPWT to be a practical dressing choice linked to improved outcomes in patients.\n\nDISCLOSURE\n\nThe authors have no financial interest to declare in relation to the content of this article.",
